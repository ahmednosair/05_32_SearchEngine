The Flying Luttenbachers
The Flying Luttenbachers are an American instrumental unit led by multiinstrumentalist  composer  producer Weasel Walter The Luttenbachers have created a body of work focused on musical extremity and dissonance Over the course of the band the personnel has shifted numerous times around the artistic leadership of Walter The music has run a gamut from intense allacoustic free improvisation to complex modernistic rock composition electronic noise to punkinspired jazz Walter has been quoted as drawing inspiration from the fields of punk death metal free jazz and no wave

The Flying Luttenbachers formed in December 1991 in Chicago Illinois as a punk jazz trio with Hal Russell tenor and soprano saxophones trumpet Chad Organ tenor saxophone and Weasel Walter drums The band derived their moniker from Russells birthname Harold Luttenbacher Russell left the band in June 1992 and was soon replaced by Ken Vandermark for the recording of the Flying Luttenbachers first 7 record

The band has since featured a frequently shifting cast of free jazz and experimental rock musicians including Fred LonbergHolm Kurt Johnson Jeb Bishop Alex Perkolup Mick Barr Ed Rodriguez Mike Green and Jonathan Hischke The Flying Luttenbachers have toured Europe and the US extensively with bands like The Locust Arab On Radar Lightning Bolt US Maple Erase Errata Bobby Conn and Wolf Eyes Walter moved from Chicago to Oakland California in 2003 beginning yet another incarnation of the group The live band played their final concert in November 2006 The Flying Luttenbachers project officially ceased operation in November 2007 upon the release of a final studio album recorded solo by Walter

In 2017 the band reformed for a tour in France invited by the Sonic Protest festival The newest incarnation of the group appeared opening 3 shows for Oh Sees at Warsaw in Brooklyn NY on October 1719

Since 1996s Revenge album the Flying Luttenbachers musical output has been underlined by a gradually unravelling storyline concerning the selfobliteration of the planet Earth and the resulting aftermath The 2006 album Cataclysm concerns an interstellar battle between two monolithic entities The Void a dark silent spectre detailed on 2004s album of the same name and The Iridescent Behemoth a massive planetoid being whose tale was told on 2003s complex Systems Emerge From Complete Disorder album The music energetically utilizes deliberate harmonic dissonance and the material operates on a principle of intelligent transformation of concise amounts of interrelated themes

There were also coup utility and panel van variants introduced in 1951 48 and 1953 FJ respectively These were both based on the Standard although neither were badged this way Collectively the two cars were known as the Holden utility and panel van From March 1957 the sedan utility and panel van body styles were complemented by a new fivedoor station wagon The wagon was marketed as the Station Sedan in both Standard and Special trim levels

The Business sedan was deleted from the Holden lineup in mid1959 during the FC production run leaving just the Standard and Special However in 1962 the Holden Premier was introduced with the EJ series becoming the new flagship with the Special assigned as the midrange Holden This model trio continued until the 1968 HK series The Standard became the Belmont the Special the Kingswood with the Premier staying as is A new extendedlength Brougham also joined the lineup becoming Holdens topline offering

Swedish Modernist poetry
Swedish modernist poetry developed in the 1930s and 1940s Distinguishing features where experimentation within a variety of styles usually free prose without rhymes or metric syllables 

The lead figure of the modernists was Hjalmar Gullberg 18981961 He wrote many mystical and Christianity influenced collections such as Andliga vningar Spiritual Exercises 1932 but continued to develop and published his greatest work gon lppar Eyes Lips in 1959 

Other important modernistic poets were Artur Lundkvist 19061991 Gunnar Ekelf 19071968 Edith Sdergran 18921923 and Harry Martinson 19041978 

Gunnar Ekelf has become described as Swedens first surrealistic poet after he debuted with the poetry collection sent p jorden in 1932 a work was too unconventional to become appreciated But Ekelf moved towards romanticism and got betters reviews for his second poetry collection Dedikationen in 1934 A work that became influential for later Swedish poets was his Frjesng in 1941 a finely expressed blend of romanticism surrealism and the dark clouds of the ongoing World War II

Edith Sdergran did not achieve fame during her lifetime but is today regarded as one of the foremost modernistic poets from the Nordic countries and she has been translated into all major languages Her first poetry collection was Dikter in 1916 but it was her second collection Septemberlyran 1918 that caught the attention of a larger audience It is distinguished by a kind of beauty that had not been seen for a long time Sdergran suffered from tuberculosis which took her life as early as 1923

Harry Martinson had an unparalleled feeling of nature in the spirit of Linnaeus As typical for his generation he wrote with a free prosody not bound by rhymes and syllables A classic work was the autobiographical Flowering Nettles in 1935 His most remarkable work was however Aniara 1956 a story of a spaceship drifting through space

The arguably most famous Swedish poet of the 20th century is otherwise Tomas Transtrmer 19312015 His poetry is distinguished by a Christian mysticism moving on the verge between dream and reality the physical and the metaphysical

Kobyz
The Kobyz  or kylkobyz is an ancient Kazakh string instrument It has two strings made of horsehair The resonating cavity is usually covered with goat leather

Traditionally kobyzes were sacred instruments owned by shamans and bakses traditional spiritual medics According to legends the kobyz and its music could banish evil spirits sicknesses and death 

In the 1930s when the first folk instrument orchestras were established in the Soviet republic of Kazakhstan a new kind of kobyz came into existence It now had four metallic strings and thus became closer to a violin Such a modernized kobyz can be used to play both Kazakh music and the most complicated works of violin literature One of the few western musicians to use the kobyz is Trefor Goronwy
The kyl kyyak Kyrgyz    sometimes spelt kyl kiak and sometimes without the kyl is a stringed musical instrument used in Kyrgyz music The instrument is carved from a single piece of wood typically apricot and typically measures 6070cm It has 2 strings one to provide melody and the other resonance The kyl kyyak is played vertically with a bow and can be played on horseback The strings and bow are normally made from horse hair and many instruments feature a carved horses head This all reflects the importance of the horse in Kyrgyz rural culture

Bowed instruments may have originated in the equestrian cultures of Central Asia an example being the Kobyz Kazakh  or kylkobyz is an ancient Turkic Kazakh string instrument or Mongolian instrument Morin huurTurkic and Mongolian horsemen from Inner Asia were probably the worlds earliest fiddlers Their twostringed upright fiddles were strung with horsehair strings played with horsehair bows and often feature a carved horses head at the end of the neck  The violins violas and cellos we play today and whose bows are still strung with horsehair are a legacy of the nomads3

It is believed that these instruments eventually spread to China India the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East where they developed into instruments such as the erhu in China the rebab in the Middle East the lyra in the Byzantine Empire and the esraj in India The violin in its present form emerged in early 16thCentury Northern Italy where the port towns of Venice and Genoa maintained extensive ties to central Asia through the trade routes of the silk road

The modern European violin evolved from various bowed stringed instruments from the Middle East4 the Byzantine Empire56 It is most likely that the first makers of violins borrowed from three types of current instruments the rebec in use since the 10th century itself derived from the Byzantine lyra7 and the Arabic rebab the Renaissance fiddle and the lira da braccio8 derived5 from the Byzantine lira One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument including its tuning was in the Epitome musical by Jambe de Fer published in Lyon in 15569 By this time the violin had already begun to spread throughout Europe

Gopalakrishnan had researched playing technique and developed particular fingering and bowing disciplines of the Parur style to produce a clarity of sound and speed of delivery His style includes onefinger playing and a thematic development on singlestring octaves

Violinist Yehudi Menuhin said of a Gopalakrishnans playing I have not heard such violin in all my travels How superbly this young Indian is playing our instrument
Shri Gopalakrishnan said when he was receiving his Sangita Kalanidhi award from the Music Academy of Madras My practice is the only secret of my success and then the other secret is my father The practice what I was used to was nearly 1516 hours a day and that was a very tough one where I used to jump suddenly from Carnatic to Hindustani styles while playing Anything any award I receive is just the fruit of my practice

Vyn Jablonka
Vyn Jablonka is a village and municipality in Humenn District in the Preov Region of northeast Slovakia

Vyn Jablonka  i Felsalmd is a village in Slovakia in the Humenne district First time it was mentioned in the List of property of the Lords of Humenne in 1436 From the beginning it was a foresters village what appeared until the present day The fourth period mayor of the village is Emlia opakov 
From the nearly 700 inhabitants 1828  91 houses 678 inhabitants only 50 are now having their living place in Vysna Jablonka 
Once there used to be also a watermill that you can nowadays see at the exposition of folk architecture of the Hummen museum

When the partisans withdrew only two snipers uhajda and Jacko remained A short time afterwards a German tank battalion came through the village and stampeded some horses The two snipers went to catch them While doing that they found four German rangers who were unprepared as they were full of bravado because of the tank battalion 
After capturing the Germans an important piece of information was found out from the feldwebel Otto Vilnes one of the captured German soldiers who said that the 82nd division will take the positions at the Low Beskyds on the 26th of December with the mission to hold the line until the new and fresh 254th infantry division will come

The Partisan Brigade Sergej decided to hold the line from the 82nd division group until the arrival of the Red Army 

On the 26th of December the Germans crossed Vysna Jablonka and at the Lukovsky Slip they were defeated by the Partisans

The villages first Orthodox church was probably built in the 16th century It definitely existed in the 17th century since the first record about the church is from the year 1623 written by the resident priest In folk tales it is said that he stayed in the Potok slum

The presentday church is located in the lower part of the village at the western hill Its construction is dated to the year 1766 In the landlord records from Hummene it was first mentioned in 1880

In the year 1998 the church went to the Grecokatholic Church The orthodox votari had to have their Masses in one room at the local municipal office

Through the efforts of Empress Maria Theresa the Orthodox in this area became united with Rome with the Union of Uzhorod in 1646 Any church built in this village would have been Greek Catholic not Orthodox The church remained Greek Catholic until the Communists outlawed the Greek Catholic Church and forced Orthodoxy on the people The 1869 Census of County Zemplen Administrative Records of the County Zemplen Archive 2 of the County BorsodAbaujZemplen showed that there were 65 households in the village One was Jewish and if I remember correctly one was Roman Catholic all of the rest were Greek Catholic In 1869 there were no Orthodox households or individuals in Vysna Jablonka 

One Roman Catholic is correct He was my maternal great grandfather He came from Poland with his daughter and motherinlaw and joined the Greek Catholic Church

The village is in the northeast of Slovakia among the Low Beskyds of the Laborec Highlands It is situated close to the river Rieka which is 3km ca 14 miles away The municipality lies at an altitude of 385 metres and covers an area of 24832km
The settlement has the highest elevation in the Humenne district The next biggest cities being Humenne Snina and Medzilaborce 32km 25km and 24km away respectively

The village lies in the northern territories of Slovakia The population of animals depends on the situation

Cylon 1978
Cylons are a fictional race of robots in the original Battlestar Galactica TV series They are the primary antagonists of the series and are at war with the Twelve Colonies of humanity The Cylons also appeared in the shortlived 1980 spinoff series Galactica 1980

An updated version of the original Cylon also appears in the reimagined series briefly in a flashback battle sequence in  in handtohand combat with a young William Adama after they had shot each others fighters down and several in the show finale Daybreak on board an old Cylon refuge known as The Colony

The Cylons were created by a reptilian race also called Cylons However the reptilian race died out centuries earlier leaving behind only their race of robots

The Imperious Leader is the leader of the Cylon Alliance and most advanced Cylon model According to the ILSeries Cylon Lucifer the Imperious Leader is an ILSeries Cylon although it does not look like an ILSeries Cylon All of the Imperious Leaders look identical

The Imperious Leader has a third brain and a body shell resembling the reptilian Cylons The original novelization of the pilot episode states that the Imperious Leaders third brain is specifically designed to emulate the human mind solely for the purpose of anticipating human actions Since the novelization however also specifically describes the Cylons as living organic reptilian beings rather than robots it is not clear whether the robot Imperious Leader has a third brain or not The reptilian look of the Imperious Leader suggests the question whether actually all living Cylons have died out

One Imperious Leader was killed at the Battle of Carillon pilot episode His successor was possibly destroyed during the Battle of Gamoray episode The Living Legend Part 2

In the original 197879 series the voices of both the Imperious Leader and Count Iblis are identical having been provided by Patrick Macnee who played Count Iblis on camera In the Galactica 1980 episode Space Croppers the voice of the Imperious Leader was provided by Dennis Haysbert

Although they look much more civilian than centurions ILseries Cylons act as commanders for the military and governors for civilians of the Alliance  They have two brains and a mostly transparent head through which various lights can be seen pulsing They also have a metallic humanoid face with two eye scanners compared to the single eye scanner of the Centurion models and wear clothing fulllength glittering robes Two ILseries Cylons have been featured onscreen both of which have an effete humansounding voice unlike the flat mechanical tones of Centurions They are 

Two additional ILSeries Cylons are shown onscreen on the Cylon capitol of Gamoray during the Imperious Leaders visit which occurred during the episode The Living Legend Part II Lucifer refers to the second Imperious Leader as being upgraded from an ILmodel like himself

Command Centurion are Centurions with gold armor These are the lower commanders for individual military units though they can be responsible for entire Basestars and garrisons The most wellknown Cylon of this model is Commander Vulpa so identified in The Cylon Death Machine Robert Thurstons novelization of The Gun on Ice Planet Zero Their voices are slightly lower pitched than regular Centurions

In the novelization of the original series it is stated that there is an elite class of Command Centurions referred to as First Centurions roughly equivalent to feudal Counts which act as executive officers to the Imperious Leader and are not subordinate to the ILSeries and like the ILseries they were also said to have multiple brains In the TV series these are actually seen on screen though very rarely and are distinguished from other Command Centurions by black bands on their gold armor Vulpa was originally of this class but had been demoted and stationed on ice planet Arcta

Military androids with silver armor Basic Centurions make up the ground forces and pilots of the Alliance military Although Earths Roman Centurions commanded a unit of eighty men Cylon Centurions form the rank and file of the Cylon forces

Centurions are armed with a powerful energy weapon often referred to as a blaster rifle They also have bayonets and swords for close combat and the execution of prisoners

Some Centurions in the series have been given names 

The Cylon Centurions  the type most often depicted in the original Battlestar Galactica  were strikingly similar to the Imperial stormtroopers of Star Wars in fact both were designed by the same concept artist Ralph McQuarrie The similarities were so strong that it was one of the factors that prompted 20th Century Foxs lawsuit for copyright infringement against Universal Studios owners of the Battlestar Galactica copyright However the lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful

Both the gold Command Centurions and the silver Centurions had their voices vocalized with the use of an EMS Vocoder 2000

There is also a unique Cylon with glittering robes with a metallic humanoid face They are seen in the Imperious Leaders delegation to Gamoray in The Living Legend This is evidently some kind of civilian Cylon as Gamoray is said to have a very large community of civilian Cylons though how civilian Cylon society differs from its military is never explored This is the only known kind of civilian Cylons However as they must have had some kind of admission to the reception of the Imperious Leader it can be assumed that they are not typical civilian Cylons they were perhaps members of some kind of aristocracy

The Cylon humanoid is a rather new model probably first built long after the destruction of the Twelve Colonies of the Humans

Although entirely mechanical beneath an artificial skin the humanoid model is in fact an android featuring a superficial human appearance as well as a condescending attitude toward the nonhumanoid Centurions

Two Cylon humanoids are featured in the episode The Night the Cylons Landed of Galactica 1980 one of which is named Andromus

The Cylons are described as a devoted race that spends no time in any idle pursuits and they employ several models but only of necessary spacecraft such as these




In the 1978 Galactica movie and series and the 1980 spinoff the Cylons were created by an extinct reptilian race that were also called Cylons as related by Apollo in the premiere episode In the episode War of the Gods Count Baltar mentions that the reptilian Cylons were ultimately overcome by their own technology particularly after the Imperious Leader was created despite having had a slight error in its programming and recognizes Ibliss voice as that of the Cylon leader and Iblis counters that if that were true it must have been transcribed over a thousand yahren years ago

At the beginning of the series the Cylons are singularly devoted to the destruction of humanity The war started when the Cylon Empire sought to expand into the territory of the Hasaris and the Human Colonies intervened on behalf of the conquered Hasaris Due to those events the Cylon Empire now viewed the entire human race as a target

Cylons are led by the Imperious Leader an ILSeries Cylon elevated to a supreme leadership position over all Cylons All Cylons from the ILseries down typically repeat the phrase By Your Command when responding to any order

The Cylon Empire is also responsible for tributary powers under the aegis of the Cylon Alliance The Ovions an insectoid race enslaved by the Cylons and transported to the planet Carillon for mining purposes are the only known member of the Cylon Alliance shown onscreen Aside from the Ovions and the defeated Hasaris the only other known race conquered by the Cylons are the Delphians which are mentioned to have been exterminated in The Living Legend

Cylon society appears to be almost exclusively military Until the discovery of Gamoray which the Colonial fleet had targeted for its rich fuel reserves no civilian Cylon outpost had ever been seen by anyone


The Berkley book series also explored two other aspects of Cylon design The first is the development of multiple brain status This allows Cylons additional thinking and deductive abilities The second is an unexplained talent for knowing when a human is lying which was suggested in the episode The Lost Warrior

Presented in The Gun on Ice Planet Zero book the second of the two novels written before the network insisted the Cylons become robots their multibrain status is the surgical inclusion of an auxiliary brain allowing for higherlevel thinking abilities The command centurion and garrison commander on planet Tairac Vulpa demonstrated this ability


According to the Maximum Press comic of Battlestar Galactica just prior to the start of The Thousand Yahren War the Cylonss Imperious Leader made a deal with the mysterious and demonic Count Iblis meaning Satan in the Arabic language to betray his entire race in exchange for power that would allow him to become like Count Iblis Count Iblis however having lied about the process of empowerment instead changed the Imperious Leader into a cybernetic entity more machine than organic being Enraged the Imperious Leader swore revenge and became more and more driven by conquest and warfare

In the Maximum Press comic the Cylons were originally led by a ruthless conquest and expansionismdriven emperor named Sobekkta one of the original living Cylons who were a race of intelligent humanoid reptiles

In Battlestar Galactica  16 Berserker During a planetary search Apollo unfortunately comes across a lone Mark III prototype Cylon This advanced Cylon is more creative and adaptive like humans in its strategy making the Mark III more capable to defeat humans However the existing Cylons deemed this advanced Cylon prototype more a threat to them due to its unquenchable megalomania to rule so they marooned him far from the Cylon empire until needed if ever

The Cylons also appear in the official computer game adaptation which is a prequel to both the original and reimagined series

Larami came out with a bubble toy in 1978 called the Battlestar Galactica Cylon Bubble Machine as well as a line of other inexpensive toys

Cylon reimagining
Cylons are a fictional artificiallyintelligent species envisioned in the Battlestar Galactica science fiction series and related franchises Originally created to serve human needs like other machines a series of events involving the transfer of a humans consciousness into a Cylons neural network led Cylons to evolve into sentient selfaware beings The original Cylons were purely mechanical

The Cylon was reimagined in the second Battlestar Galactica television series and its prequel Caprica The first configurations Centurions were robots Others were cyborgs whose different configurations incorporated biological elements including some that were nearly indistinguishable from humans
One of the series core themes is All of this has happened before and will happen again Cylon Centurions were invented twice Once thousands of years before the events of Battlestar Galactica and later they fought a war against the Thirteenth Tribe on Earth

The second Centurion creation is detailed in the prequel series Caprica There they were created by Zoe Graystone and her father Daniel Graystone owner of Graystone Industries

The Caprica Cylon is a combination of programming done by Zoe and Daniels MCPenhanced MetaCognitive Processor Graystone Industries U87 Robot A common activity on Caprica was to participate in a virtual world VWorld that allowed players to live an alternate existence The original Cylon was developed as a place to house Zoes avatar virtual existence after she is killed in a bombing on a maglev train in Caprica Episode 1 Her father sees her avatar in VWorld and forces her best friend Lacy to take him to her there where she explains that she is much more than a simple digital simulation She has Zoes memories from a neural scan Zoe developed to extend a VWorld character into a virtual instance of the person The digital Zoe says to her father I dont feel like a copy and she becomes the basis of the first Cylons

Cylons were originally accepted into Caprican culture as robotic workers after a group of them under direct remote control by Graystone himself with the help of his wife Amanda successfully thwarted an attack on the public at Atlas Stadium by the Soldiers of the One STO The Cylons then spread throughout the colonies as a worker class but because they had basic selfawareness they became increasingly resentful of their servitude

In Battlestar Galactica the Cylons were created thousands of years before the series began They destroyed the Thirteenth Tribe living on the original Earth 2000 years before

BSGr Cylon society consists of three classes biological rulingclass androids pejoratively skinjobs laborwarrior class Centurions and a transportair warrior class Basestars and Raiders Basestars and Raiders are partly biological cyborgs and as such are vulnerable to biological threats such as disease Raiders and Centurions while intelligent were inhibited from exercising free will although the Hybrids that controlled Basestars did exercise some autonomy and were respected by the skinjobs

The skinjobs lead Cylon society Some are sleeper agents programmed with false memories to think they are human Cylons can convincingly interact with humans and are capable of intimate relationships

They have limited superhuman abilities such as increased stamina and strength and the ability to connect with computer systems Cylons are more sensitive than humans to some forms of radiation and more resistant than humans to others They can upload their memories to other copies of their model through a central station Another Cylon of the same model can then access these memories The humanoid Cylons have the ability to distinguish between copies by sight unlike Centurions and humans

Centurions are often called toasters by humans partly a reference to their metallic construction but also to demean them Toaster was also used to derogate skinjob another derogatory term and an homage to the film Blade Runner in which BSGr star Edward James Olmos has a supporting role Centurions were also termed chromejobs or bulletheads The chronological origin of the word toaster can be found in the prequel Caprica episode 10 which was created after BSG had ended After a car crash made the firstever test Cylon inoperable it was considered toast after which Tomas Vergis joked or a toaster The term skinjob is originally used in Caprica episode 17 where a new body is being discussed for an avatar and AI of Zoe The parents emphasize it will be with skin as opposed to the Cylon metal prototypes which she then calls a skinjob

Cylons were initially unable to produce children with each other They turned their attention to mating with humans Their crossbreeding experiments in facilities called farms are unsuccessful They theorize that love is necessary for them to procreate because God is love in their theology This leads to a successful experiment in which an Eight and a human Karl Agathon fall in love and produce a daughter named Hera

Skinjobs can download their consciousness into another body when the body they are using dies giving them virtual immortality These downloads have a limited range requiring the Cylons to build a Resurrection Ship to capture them If not within range of a Resurrection Ship downloading is unavailable and a Cylons death is permanent The downloading process is shared by the semiorganic Raider spacecraft which allows Raiders who have been killed several times to become more formidable fighters Scar The Centurions do not download Resurrection Ships function as boosters for the central Resurrection Hub Without the Hub resurrection is not possible

This technology was first shown in Caprica in an attempt to resurrect deceased relatives in a socalled resurrection program first called that way in episode 13 in virtual reality where one could meet and interact with those one was mourning for

Cylons have an ability referred to as projection a form of realistic daydreaming that allows them to change the appearance of their surroundings in their own mind eg making the corridors of a ship look like a forest etc They have the ability to touch smell etc the fantasy environment They can share projections and create virtual individuals as part of the fantasy This ability allows them to express their subconscious desires

If a Cylon is deemed dangerous by the other models he or she may be boxed  deactivated with consciousness and memories placed in storage This may involve a particular copy or an entire line Boxed consciousnesses are stored in the Resurrection Hub and can be unboxed The term was also used in the prequel Caprica episode 10 which discusses boxing a defunct test cylon as literally placing it in a crate for deep storage As Caprica is the prequel this is chronologically the first time of its use from which the Cylons derived their own definition

Between 34000 years before the Second Cylon War it is implied that the humans and Cylons of Kobol fought each other but the nature of the conflict remains unrevealed The Thirteenth Tribe were Cylons who fled Kobol and settled on a planet they dubbed Earth Eventually they developed the ability to reproduce sexually Resurrection technology fell into disuse and was lost The Final Five redeveloped resurrection following warnings by mysterious angels that a Kobollike disaster was coming When life on Cylon Earth was destroyed in a nuclear war between the thirteenth tribe and their mechanical Cylon creations stemming from the latters maltreatment at the hands of the Tribe the Final Five downloaded into an orbiting vessel

The Final Five wanted to warn the other Twelve Colonies to treat their Cylon workers well to prevent another catastrophe However without faster than light FTL travel they required approximately 2000 years to make the journey relative to human time while only a few years passed inside the ship due to Special Relativity When they arrived the Twelve Colonies Cylon Centurions had revolted and the first Cylon War was raging It lasted roughly twelve and a half years

The Final Five learned that these Centurions were trying to develop organic bodies through experiments on humans resulting in the first Hybrid To end the war the Final Five helped the Centurions develop skinjob model numbers One to Eight model number Sevens creation was sabotaged by One and resurrection technology The war ended with an armistice and an attempt by the Colonies to establish diplomatic relations between the parties Instead the Cylons disappeared for forty years

The first of the Colonial skinjobs One John Cavil refused to let the Final Fives concern for humanity blind them He boxed the Final Five He then periodically sent them to the Colonies to see how terrible humanity was

After forty years the Colonial Admiralty sent Battlestar Valkyrie on a covert mission close to the armistice line to gather intelligence on Cylon activity A stealth ship from the Valkyrie crossed the armistice line but was intercepted by the Cylons Three years later the Cylons initiated a surprise attack on the Colonies The attack was successful because a Cylon agent later known as Caprica Six infiltrated Capricas colonial defense network with the unwitting complicity of renowned scientist Gaius Baltar and created backdoor programs to shut down the network and its defenses The attacks wiped out billions of humans nearly the entire colonial population Two Battlestars  Galactica and Pegasus  survived A fleet of civilian ships was scattered throughout the neighboring space Together they fled into deep space

The Cylons pursued them while initiating the next phase of their evolution procreation Female human survivors were detained and used in experiments to create Cylonhuman hybrids The experiments were unsuccessful leading the Cylons to conclude that the missing component was love They tested this by using an Eight posing as Lt Sharon Boomer Valerii from Galactica to seduce a marooned Galactica officer Lt Karl Helo Agathon on Caprica They fell in love The Eight abandoned the Cylons helping Helo to escape The couple later produced the first viable humanCylon birth This Eight joined the fleet with Helo She later married Helo joined the Colonial military and received the call sign Athena

Ten months after the initial attacks Eight Sharon Valerii call sign Boomer attempted to assassinate Commander Adama under the influence of unexplained programing unknown to her She was unaware that she was a Cylon before the attack though she had been uneasy because of unexplained blackouts during various attempts to sabotage Galactica A vengeful crew mate Cally Henderson killed her She downloaded into a new body and settled on Cylonoccupied Caprica in her former apartment unable to relinquish her human identity She led a campaign for better treatment of the humans She and other likeminded Cylons influenced the Cylon civilization which withdrew from the colonial home worlds and pursued benevolent treatment of the humans and then reconciliation

During this time the halfhuman halfCylon hybrid Hera Agathon was born on Galactica Fearing that the Cylons might capture the child President Laura Roslin faked Heras death and secretly had her adopted by a human woman

The humans settled on a barren planet they dubbed New Caprica The refuge lasted a year before the Cylons found them The Cylons occupied the new human settlement at first peacefully but later forcefully and more viciously as the human Resistance increased In the end they used punitive methods to keep the humans in line including summary executions and infiltration by seemingly sympathetic Cylons One such infiltrator was an Eight model who manipulated Felix Gaeta into giving her a list of people the Resistance desired to free from Cylon detention whom she then had executed

Four months later the colonials escaped with the help of a resistance movement and the efforts of both the Galactica and Pegasus The escape required Athenas help She entered the Cylon facility and took the keys to the various Colonial landing craft Prior to this a Three found out from a human oracle that Hera was alive and on the planet She rescued Hera after her adoptive mother was killed during the escape The Pegasus sacrificed itself to save the crippled Galactica but the crew survived joining Galactica

The Cylons then adopted the colonials mission to find the home of the Thirteenth Tribe a planet they called Earth intending to settle there They resumed pursuit of the fleet but upon reaching the Lions Head Nebula dispatched a Basestar to investigate The Basestar took on board a canister left by the Thirteenth Tribe The canister contained an airborne virus that proved deadly to the Cylons The virus persisted through the download process so the Basestar that had been dispatched for the investigation was abandoned to avoid contamination The colonial fleet discovered the Basestar and captured the ailing Cylons The colonial fleets attempt to use the virus to wipe out the Cylons was defeated when Helo repulsed by the strategy had the captive Cylons killed while out of range of a resurrection ship

Meanwhile Boomer turned increasingly antihuman She was charged with Heras care but Hera rejected her During a truce negotiation Boomer told Athena that her daughter was alive but sick on the Baseship She invited Athena to come to the Baseship and rejoin her people because the occupation showed that humans and Cylons were incompatible and that humans would never truly accept her Later desperate for her child Athena convinced Helo to kill her so she could resurrect on the Baseship Once there she retrieved Hera with the help of Caprica Six who killed a hatefilled Boomer to prevent her from killing the child She had tried to prevent Athena from taking Hera to the humans and declared that Cylons were never meant to have children Caprica Six returned with Athena and was detained by Adama in Athenas old cell

As the pursuit continued internal relations among the Cylons began to break down A Three violated her programming by actively seeking information about the Final Five seeing a vision of them on the Algae Planet where the Colonials stopped to get food From that she was able to identify them She and her twins were then boxed Within the fleet a musical activation signal a version of All Along the Watchtower was received by the Final Five awakening their memories and bringing them together Two were Galactica crew members Saul Tigh and Galen Tyrol while Samuel Anders was an athlete and Tory Foster a political operative They kept their discovery secret Tigh and Anders remained loyal to the humans willing to fight and possibly die for them Tyrol and Foster were ambivalent with Tyrol having prohuman leanings Foster became increasingly antihuman murdering Tyrols wife without remorse after she learned the truth about their identities After their realization the fleet came under attack but during the battle a Cylon Raider identified Anders and he and his fellow Raiders broke off the attack refusing to fight

This set off a debate in the Cylon government regarding the Raiders Ones Fours and Fives voted to lobotomize the Raiders to make them acquiescent Twos Sixes and Eights led principally by a Six named Natalie became convinced that the Raiders had sensed the presence of the Final Five The tie was broken by the unprecedented event of Boomer voting against the rest of her models to side with the Ones Fours and Fives Natalie objected to Cavils actions and removed inhibitor circuitry from the Centurions granting them free will and independent thought The Centurions then killed the models who were lobotomizing the Raiders

In response Cavil lured Natalie and her forces into a trap beyond resurrection range and slaughtered them Only Natalies crippled Basestar survived With her Raiders destroyed except for some Heavy Raiders and the surviving Twos Sixes and Eights minus Boomer Natalie allowed Two Leoben Conoy to locate Kara Thrace and ally with the humans A deal was struck the humans would help the rebels unbox the Threes so that they could identify the Final Five and the rebels would lead the humans to the Resurrection Hub and help them destroy it so Cavil would lose resurrection forever The humans transferred half of their Vipers to the Rebel Basestar Fearing for Hera Athena murdered Natalie causing the Hybrid to jump the Rebel Basestar with Roslin on board away before everyone was ready The Hybrid took the Basestar to the Hub where the allies had the human Vipers towed into battle by Cylon Heavy Raiders so they could catch the Cylons by surprise The plan worked and the Hubs FTL drive was taken out stranding it While the Rebel Basestar engaged two other Basestars Helo and an Eight boarded the Hub to unbox DAnna and found her already unboxed by Cavil and Boomer The three escaped and the Vipers nuked the Hub destroying it and Cylon resurrection capability

After a standoff the identities of the four Cylons in the human fleet were revealed and together they found the devastated Earth a nuclear wasteland There Tigh Anders Foster and Tyrol got flashes of their life on Earth and Tigh learned the identity of the fifth member his dead wife Ellen The humans and rebel Cylons minus DAnna abandoned Earth in search of a new home together The humans and Cylons ended up striking a deal in return for joining the fleet as full members the rebels would upgrade the fleets FTL drives with Cylon technology increasing their jump distance by at least three times This led to a political coup and failed mutiny but left Anders seriously injured although with his true memories returned as the accompanying brain damage broke the mental blocks Cavil had placed on his original identity After telling the others as much as he could Anders slipped into a coma from which he partially emerged while acting as Galacticas hybrid

Cavil revealed that he had a resurrected Ellen Tigh as his prisoner ever since her download after she was killed on New Caprica Her resurrection restored her true memories although her only company was Cavil and Boomer whom hed let in on the secret After Cavil planned to dissect her brain to try to regain resurrection technology Boomer helped Ellen escape to the fleet as part of a plan to kidnap Hera so the Cylons could study her

Galactica and some of the rebel Cylons assaulted the Cylon space station that was the Cylon homeworld to rescue Hera while the Rebel Basestar protected the fleet During the battle Boomer who had begun to feel remorse for kidnapping Hera killed the Four that was starting to dissect the child and carried her back to her parents Athena then killed Boomer The rescue team returned to Galactica where Cavil led a Centurion assault but was defeated He took Hera hostage but was convinced to create a permanent peace with the humans in exchange for the Final Five giving him resurrection technology

Tyrol learns that Foster murdered Cally and breaks the download causing the Cylons to attack again Cavil kills himself An unmanned Raptor is struck by an asteroid causing the dead pilot Racetrack to fire eight nuclear missiles into the Colony knocking it out of orbit and into a black hole destroying it and every remaining One Four and Five Galactica jumps away and arrives at a habitable planet The humans and rebel Cylons settle there while the rebel Centurions are given their freedom and the Rebel Basestar to find their own destiny Anders flies the human fleet and all its technology into the Sun 150000 years later it is revealed that the planet they settled on is our Earth while Hera was Mitochondrial Eve which means all modern humans are partly descended from the humanoid Cylons

The Cylon Centurion is a mechanical infantry model made less intelligent than human models BSGr Centurions retain the silver appearance robotic body helmetlike head and oscillating red bar eye of their forbearers but are larger taller stronger more agile and have a more streamlined appearance They also have retractable guns built into their lower arms bladed fingertips and heavy armour

The Centurions were monotheists who believed in a single loving God

The first colonial Centurion is seen and is identified as a Cybernetic Lifeform Node Built on contract for the Caprican Defense Ministry the Cylons are to replace human warriors on the battlefield Caprica pilot

The U87 prototype Cylon contains a copy of the consciousness of Daniel Graystones daughter Zoe Graystone Daniel Graystone conceives of the Cylons as a slave race and demonstrates this by instructing the prototype to rip her own arm off After catching it interacting with the family dog he realises that the prototype contains Zoes consciousness and attempts without success to force her to admit her identity She is able to defeat the tests he attempts and convinces him that she is just a robot Upon learning that Graystone is about to erase her memory she escapes

The Battlestar Galactica miniseries displays an original model Centurion on display in Galacticanowikinowikis museum hangar The original Centurion is also depicted in a diagram reviewed by the armistice officer in the opening scene

In  Centurions are almost identical to those from the original series except they are rendered using CGI and have exposed joints The Centurion in the museum hangar is retconned as a CGI version with exposed joints Initialmodel Centurions are among those seen defending the Cylon colony from an assault by Colonial and rebel Cylon forces Part 2 of Daybreak

The body had synthetic skin although this model was still primitive and was mechanical rather than biological

Centurions do not download into new bodies when they are destroyed according to screenwriter Ronald D Moore The Hybrids have something to do with the programming of the Centurions When the virus infected the Hybrid on the infected Basestar the Centurions shut down Torn However Centurions can function independently when no Basestars or skinjobs are nearby A Centurion immediately fires upon an Eight when she unplugs a Hybrid Faith It is unclear whether this was in willful defiance of the Hybrid or as a result of the removal of their higher function inhibitor modules Six of One

After the inhibitor modules that restrict higher functions granting them independent thought were removed although still largely servile the Centurions were shown to exhibit humanlike behaviour such as politeness and consideration eg responding to please

These Centurions are taller than their predecessors and are sleeker They possess less of a humanoid structure averaging a head taller than humans They retain the bipedal structure of the first model as well as rough hands and feet The feet of the new Centurions are a simple twotoed form that produces a distinctive sound when they walk as the toes move and touch the ground They retain the distinctive oscillating red eye as well as a rudimentary mouth even though they cannot speak The hands are much thinner and visibly segmented and more clawlike they can cut flesh and mortally wound a human making them effective closecombat weapons These claws can be modified at will to a more fingerlike digit or less of a razorsharp weapon

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this model is the twin cannons built into each hand mounted on the side that can be deployed by retracting the hands It was originally established that the Centurions could not move while firing their cannons however in later seasons they were seen to walk and even run while firing The Centurions carry heavy weapons such as antiaircraft rockets that are strapped to their backs for missions where their cannons are not enough Most Centurions can be destroyed or at least damaged by smallarms fire however most require substantial artillery or special rounds to be destroyed a Centurions party that boarded Galactica were especially strong and required explosive rounds to be destroyed as regular rounds proved completely ineffective

These Centurions greatly outmatched the previous model They were betterarmoured stronger and carried internal weapons as opposed to their predecessors who needed to carry weapons such as rifles and pistols like their human creators

The later form of Cylon Raiders are biomechanical entities integrated into small fighter spacecraft They resurrect when they die Raiders are subservient and were compared to trained animals by the humanoid Cylons A Raider nicknamed Scar developed a personality Scar Scar was the Cylons top gun driven by a bitter hatred of humans He was killed and reborn many times Raiders do not use vocal communication appearing to communicate through unspecified electronic signals Modern Raiders unlike their predecessors in the First Cylon War are alive with a complex system of veins organs and biological fluids contained within their main body The Raiders are programmed but began with some measure of autonomy and personality When one Raider saw a Final Five in the human fleet during an attack it retreated leading the remaining Raiders back to the Basestar The Raiders then refused to fight the humans for fear of harming their Cylon kin This led to the lobotomy vote

Welltrained Colonial pilots even nuggets can beat a Raider in most situations The Raiders primary advantage seemed to be in their massive numbers while Galactica carries around 40 Vipers Cylon Basestars support 300600 Raiders The Raiders are maneuverable once described by Kara as a squirmy son of a bitch and most human pilots were unable to keep them in sight for more than a few seconds

The Raiders primary weapons are two kinetic energy guns mounted on the underside of their wings close to the main body They may carry conventional missiles and tactical nuclear weapons Raiders by revealing their red eye can transmit deadly computer viruses or signals to enemy ships which strike with brutal efficiency and can shut down Colonial vessels turning off their power and making them easy prey If all else fails Raiders sometimes attempt suicide attacks A single Raider can destroy a sizeable transport

The Raiders from the First Cylon War were larger spacecraft driven by Centurion pilots and not alive These are used by the remaining First War Centurions guarding the Original Hybrid and the Cylon Colony and later became obsolete

The later Cylon Raiders are different from Cylon Heavy Raiders Like the raiders of the First Cylon War the Heavy Raiders are transports and attack bombers and are primarily piloted by Sixes and Eights

Although they made only a single appearance in the original continuity the episode The Night the Cylons Landed from Galactica 1980 humanoid Cylons are the focus of the reimagining They are usually known as the Cylons or derogatorily as skinjobs or toasters Skinjobs are indistinguishable from humans due to their creation through synthetic biology employing real bones flesh and blood rather than metal but still possess a digital molecular structure Some are programmed to believe that they are organic until otherwise informed

The Cylons can communicate nonverbally but do not have a hive mind even among a single model and are most often shown talking to one another

The thirteen distinct humanoid models are divided into the Final Five that originated on Earth and Significant Seven the latter term is only used by the Battlestar Galactica producers The Final Five are unique and are the last survivors of the Thirteenth Tribe They developed the Seven originally eight in conjunction with the Centurions of the Twelve Colonies Each copy shares biology and general personality throughout their model but they develop into distinct individuals The Final Five showed the Centurions how to make skinjobs and attempted to give them human characteristics love mercy thinking that these characteristics would prevent war 

Prior to the Final Five arriving to stop the first Cylon War on Caprica the Centurions had already made their first humanoid called the Hybrid for the purpose of controlling the baseship Once the Final Five arrived on Caprica they transferred their technology to the Centurions and gave them eight fully humanoid models created by them

Cylon society is made up of the seven whose types are numbered One Two Three Four Five Six and Eight The extinct Seven model the Daniel series was destroyed by a One decades prior to the Colonies destruction

As revealed towards the end of season 4 there is a 2000 year gap between the exodus of the first humanoid Cylons the Final Five from the destruction of life on Earth due to a robot Centurion war there and their arrival at Caprica in the middle of the Caprican robot Centurion war Originally the Final Five had left Earth both to seek a new home and to warn the other Twelve Colonies about the dangers of mistreating Centurions so that they might avoid the fate of Earth However at the time FTL faster than light starship jumping technology was unknown so they made the journey using slower than light technology resurrecting themselves when their bodies wore out over the span of 2000 years 

It should be noted that when the Earth was nuked 2000 years prior the Final Five Cylons had already planned for this event and were resurrected onto their baseship in orbit when their bodies were destroyed in a global nuclear attack that wiped out all life on Earth This resurrection was the event which triggered the Final Five Cylons to begin their 2000 year journey to Caprica only to find out upon arrival that humans and Centurion robots had begun fighting towards extinction just as they had 2000 years prior on Earth

The Final Five arrived at Caprica to discover that the Caprican Centurions had already begun experimenting with creating humanoid Cylons by creating the first Hybrid to control their baseship As part of the agreement to end the war with humans the Final Five Cylons gave the Caprican Centurions eight humanoid Cylon models and a resurrection ship 

During the 40year gap between the end of the first Cylon war and the second Cylon war on Caprica Cavil model number One of the eight humanoid Cylons that the Final Five had designed and created rebelled against the Final Five and took command of the Centurions and of the other humanoid Cylons In order to get rid of the Final Five who blocked him from continuing the Cylon war he tricked the Final Five into to living on Caprica with their memories erased and false memories implanted He was deluded into believing that he could show the Final Five that they were wrong about humans by letting them suffer with the humans as their civilization was destroyed as a result of him restarting the Cylon war and then restoring their memories while resurrecting them on the Cylon baseship Cavil thought this lesson would help the Final Five realize that humans were flawed creatures and thus persuade them to take his side

Ellen the original creator of the eight humanoid models programmed them with a belief in a single allloving God She did this because she wanted the Cylons to know love and to be peaceful and to avoid war in the future However Cavil rejected his programming of believing in God Other Cylons particularly the DAnna model justified attacking the humans perhaps as a form of religious fundamentalism with the goal of remaking the world as a Cylon OneGod utopia

In addition Cavil regarded the creation of humanoid Cylons as a mistake and believed that Cylons should return to a purely mechanical form so that they could experience the world in ways not limited by human senses For example he said that when a star explodes into a supernova he wants to see the Xrays and gamma rays with his eyes and not be limited by biological human eyes 

Cavil was fearful of the mechanical Centurions rejecting the secret removal of circuitry to prevent the Centurions from having free will in Season 4 When Centurions on one of the Cylon baseships received this modification and thus developed free will they revolted against Cavil because they rejected his policy of removing the biological brains of the Raider ships and returning them to a purely mechanical form so that they would follow orders without emotion interfering This small rebellion left the Twos Sixes and Eights in charge of one of the baseships in the Cylon fleet The rebel baseship later forms an alliance with the human fleet after being attacked by Cavils Cylon fleet and left to drift in space without FTL propulsion

The skinjobs are responsible for command decisions While the command structure has not been fully explored some hints at organization are known At the end of the miniseries a group of skinjobs debate what to do and one speaks authoritatively to which another responds by your command a reference to the original series They can freely impose blocks on the behavior and cognitive programming of Centurions Raiders and Hybrids Multiple skinjobs with blocked memories are spread among the surviving humans including members of Galacticas crew

A Cylon council made up of multiple copies of several models appears to cast votes collectively by model indicating that model plays an important role in the structure of Cylon society Precipice Some models are implied to have higher or lower ranks than others During the occupation of New Caprica a select group of individuals who mostly had been within the Colonies such as Boomer and Caprica Six seemed to have seniority within their model One of each model was seen deliberating and discussing their course of action with each of the senior copies representing the opinion of their model

Although little is known about Cylon psychology it is clear that they share many human emotional vulnerabilities This is evidenced by Ginas catatonic state as a result of the severe trauma of her abuse at the hands of the Pegasus crew This abuse was presented in the form of multiple sexual assaults battery starvation and outright torture SixCaprica Six also revealed that Cylons exist by projecting an environment of their choice on the realphysical world

Ones subvert consensus by undertaking many actions without the knowledge or consent of their siblings such as turning against the Sevens and the Final Five and then reprogramming their siblings to hide this

The main antagonist of the series John Cavil initially poses as a priest Lay Down Your Burdens His true identity is revealed when a second copy boards Galactica and reveals his Cylon nature Cavils role in society is contradictory He occasionally serves as a devils advocate pointing out the absurdity of his fellow Cylons and their religious zealotry He was revealed to be a One Six of One

Cavil has a sadistic Machiavellian streak that none of the other Cylon models share He tortured Saul Tigh by gouging out one of his eyes and showing it to him He took pleasure in blackmailing Ellen Tigh into providing sexual favours in exchange for releasing Saul from captivity on New Caprica

Cavil is an atheist alone among the seven models and often mockingly uses air quotes when saying the word God His opinions of humans are contradictory He is one of the most violently antihuman Cylon models advocating a policy of culling humanity down to a controllable number He claimed to have been against the destruction of the Twelve Colonies and advocates a unique Cylon Society not one that emulates its creators After arranging Tighs release Cavil further manipulated the situation by again blackmailing Ellen to betray the human resistance on New Caprica and threatening to kill Saul if she did not comply

Cavil is aloof compared to the other models though Boomer implies that Cavil has begun teaching her his views that Cylons should not emulate humanity Cavil knows aspects of Cylon lore that the others models do not His knowledge of the Final Five led him to box the DAnna and the other Threes to ensure that whatever she had learned about the Final Five stayed hidden

He was made in Ellens fathers image Ellen also named him John He hates this name and shows deep resentment towards Ellen at being limited by having to live in a humanoid body

One was the first model and helped the Final Five create the other seven Therefore Ones knew about the Final Five while the others knew only that they existed For an unstated reason Cavil rejected the human trait of mercy and turned against the Final Five

When the Final Five were resurrected Cavil implants new memories for their life in the Twelve Colonies He also alters the original programming of the seven other models so that searching for talking about and even thinking about the Final Five was strictly forbidden

Ones are played by Dean Stockwell

Leoben first appears as a smuggler at the munitions depot at Ragnar Anchorage where he was exposed as a Cylon miniseries Twos are religious zealots carrying a pathological and sometimes sexual obsession with Starbuck His Cylon identity was revealed Six of One

Twos are skilled at deceit Conoy manipulates Starbuck into thinking that a young girl he had kidnapped on New Caprica is her biological daughter Twos display cunning minds and the ability to find and exploit others weaknesses Unlike other Cylons Twos appear to be prescient and on several occasions prophesy future events

Twos are played by Callum Keith Rennie

DAnna Biers was a reporter for the Fleet News Service Roslin and Adama grant Biers access to all areas of Galactica to investigate her suspicions of a military coverup surrounding civilian deaths aboard the Gideon Their belief is that Biers will discover that military personnel deal with the same pressures and fears as the rest of the fleet and that the events were a tragic mistake The Biers model used the documentary as a means to relay information that Sharon was alive to Cylons on Caprica Final Cut DAnna was revealed to be a Three in the episode Downloaded

Threes are among the more aggressive models and share a fatalistic understanding of the Cylon religion believing that everything that happens is the will of God Their religious devotion masks a deep questioning by Threes about why God allows bad things to happen Theodicy

Threes possess an alphafemale aggressiveness advancing themselves as de facto leaders in any situation They are often rivals of Ones and Sixes The rivalry with the Sixes partly stems from when CapricaSix killed a Three to save Samuel Anders from torture and death DAnna and CapricaSix later reconcile and both of them are involved in a relationship with Baltar Baltar seduces DAnna by exploring her crisis of faith which leads to her secretly committing suicide a major Cylon taboo to experience resurrection She feels these neardeath experiences will answer questions regarding her faith notably the identity of the Final Five DAnna eventually sees the faces of the Final Five Rapture Unfortunately as she does so the other Cylons vote to box all Threes Cavil tells her that what she had seen regarding the Final Five was unacceptable and that her memories would be kept in cold storage DAnna but not the other Threes is later unboxed The Hub

Threes are among the more antihuman Cylons DAnna tells Baltar that she believes that humanity must die to prevent future generations of humans from seeking revenge Exodus Part II She is temporarily the leader of the rebel faction of Cylons that makes peace with the human fleet but when the first Earth is found to be a devastated ruin she decides to stay there and die rather than continuing the cycle of death exodus and rebirth

Threes are played by Lucy Lawless

ONeill poses as a human physician who treats Starbuck for a gunshot wound in what was supposedly a resistance hospital on Caprica The Farm In reality this was a Cylon farm set up to breed humanCylon hybrids using captured humans Simon performed invasive tests on Starbucks reproductive organs He was revealed to be the 4th model in the episode Six of One Fours are consistently medical specialists

Another Four poses as a married man in the Colonial Fleet Cavil at one point asks Simon to leave his life behind and destroy the ship he lives on He defies this order to protect his wife and her child by committing suicide and flying out of an air lock He was not close enough to a Resurrection Ship and therefore died permanently 

Fours are played by Rick Worthy

Doral debuts as a public relations worker for the abortive Galactica museum miniseries Another Five sneaks aboard the Galactica and detonates an explosive Litmus This event prompts the fleetwide announcement that Cylons can have a human appearance He was revealed to be the 5th model in the episode Downloaded

During the Occupation of New Caprica the Fives are antihuman and aggressive They specialize in public relations and control using largescale events and media manipulation

Fives are played by Matthew Bennett

The first model explicitly revealed to be a Cylon in the miniseries Sixes often use seduction to their advantage Important copies include Shelly Godfrey Gina Inviere Head Six Caprica Six and Natalie

One of the Sixes later known as Caprica Six on her way to meet with Baltar murders an infant by breaking its neck This could either be considered sociopathic or a mercy killing due to the coming Cylon attack She saves Baltars life when his house was struck by a blast wave from the Cylon attack

Caprica Six has a lovehate relationship with Baltar alternately defending him to other Cylon models or leaving him to suffer at their hands

A reincarnation of Caprica Six commits the first incident of CylononCylon violence killing a Three with a rock to save Anders life

Caprica Six was imprisoned on Galactica after helping Athena escape from the Cylons with Hera She offers to testify against Baltar While in the brig she has a relationship with Saul Tigh that results in the first CylonCylon pregnancy in 2000 years which ends in a miscarriage

Caprica Six has an Inner Baltar which only she sees similar to how Baltar has an Inner Six that only he can see Inner Baltar serves as a sort of conscience for Caprica Six and as an advisor in times of trouble as Inner Six does for him Inner Baltar appears at least once to Baltar himself Before their true nature is revealed speculation rises that Baltar is a Cylon Inner Baltar and Inner Six appear to Baltar and Caprica Six  all four sharing a moment together  as the first part of the revelation that the Inners are divine beings referred to as Angels manipulating both the Colonials and Cylons into fulfilling Gods plan series finale

Godfrey was on Galactica after the Cylon attack She accused Baltar of treasonously sabotaging human defenses and therefore of killing several million people Six Degrees of Separation She also appears in  TV movie

Gina acted as a contractor for Pegasus and was in a relationship with Admiral Cain When Cain discovered that Gina was a Cylon agent she ordered her crew to push her programming in an attempt to see if Gina was vulnerable to emotional trauma Gina later escaped with Baltars aid assassinated Cain and founded a resistance group in the fleet preaching peace with the Cylons While it seemed that Gina developed feelings for Baltar and wanted to pursue him she detonated a nuclear warhead provided by Baltar that destroyed Cloud Nine other fleet ships and generated an electromagnetic signature the detection of which ultimately led the Cylon fleet to New Caprica

Other important Sixes include Natalie who originally leads the rebel Cylon faction against Cavils faction before she is killed by Athena in a misunderstanding and Sonja who was elected to represent the rebel Cylons in the Colonial fleets Quorum of Ships Captains

Sixes are played by Tricia Helfer

Daniel was the seventh Cylon model No Exit Ellen refers to Daniel as an artist and so sensitive to the world She was very close to Daniel which enraged Cavil he felt that Daniel was Ellens favorite and became jealous Cavil poisoned the amniotic fluid used to mature the Daniel copies and then corrupted Daniels genetic code This sabotage meant that no further Sevens could be created The original was also killed with Samuel Anders stating at one point that Daniel died after regaining his true memories 

Fans speculated that Starbuck or her father was a version of the corrupted Seven line Instead Daniel is merely a plot device to explain the missing number and to expand on Cavils character noting that Daniel is essentially the Abel to Cavils Cain The Sevens were a springboard for Caprica where Daniel Graystone is the name of a main character played by Eric Stoltz this Daniel is the creator of the Colonial Centurions

Sevens are never seen in the series and their physical appearance is never described

At the end of the miniseries a Six says By your command to an Eight This phrase is usually spoken to the Imperious leader in the old series by Centurions It seemed to give this particular Eight a leadership role

Sharon Boomer Valerii first appears as a Raptor pilot aboard the Galactica Her true nature as a Cylon was revealed at the end of the miniseries She acted as a sleeper agent unaware of her true nature and programmed to carry out attacks on the fleet without realizing what she is doing She was revealed to be an Eight in the episode Downloaded

The other significant Eight Sharon Athena Agathon married Karl Helo Agathon rebelled against the Cylons and joined forces with the Colonials Her child with Helo a daughter named Hera is the first Cylonhuman hybrid Such a child is the subject of a Cylon prophecy Its importance increased as it was a child born of love Shortly after Heras birth Roslin decides to mislead the Cylons into believing the child has died Her plan involves lying to Athena and Helo and giving the child to an adoptive mother Maya While aiding the Colonials in their plan to rescue the humans on New Caprica Athena sneaks into a Cylon storage facility and steals launch codes for the civilian ships trapped on New Caprica She is discovered by DAnna who informs her that Hera is still alive citing strange dreams and a prophecy by a human mystic as proof Athena believing this to be a ruse kneecaps DAnna During the exodus from New Caprica Heras caregiver is killed and DAnna finds the baby Boomer later tells Athena that Hera lives Athena has Helo kill her Athena allowing her to download into a new body within the Cylon fleet With the help of Caprica Six she rescues Hera and returns to Galactica

Eight is described as weak by Baltars Head Six and Eights usually appear more compassionate and sympathetic than other Cylons However they fully supported the destruction of the Colonies The actions of Boomer and an Eight who had a duplicitous affair with Felix Gaeta on New Caprica make it clear that Eights are capable of homicide and betrayal Eights are also capable of intense loyalty and have the ability to break from Cylon traditions and laws to help human friends or family They vote to save humanity in the Cylon civil war that Boomer starts She hesitates for a while when Cavil influences her but in the end chooses to support the humans even if it means that she must give up her life

Athena becomes completely assimilated in human culture Her child and husband become her lifes focus She is the only Cylon to create a family The Eights perceived fragility camouflage great strength and direction In one episode Athena hardwires herself to Galactica hacks into a Cylon fleet and shuts them down

Eights are played by Grace Park

Cavil killed and boxed the Final Five Later he resurrected them purged their memories and sent them to live among the humans The other six models had no knowledge of the Final Fives identities presumably blocked by Cavil though they were aware of the existence of five absent models who were not to be spoken of When DAnna a Three attempts to learn their identities Cavil boxes her entire model line as punishment In the final episode of the third season four of the final five are revealed to be characters with long histories on the Galactica Their purpose and how and why they were hidden from the rest of their kind is a major plot point of the fourth and final season when Ellen Tigh is revealed to be the fifth member

The Final Five were Cylon models who could not be named or researched by skinjobs Rapture They were the original humanoid Cylons born 2000 years before the series on Earth as part of the Thirteenth Tribe Sometimes a Great Notion They were born to Cylon parents through sexual reproduction rather than built They were the researchers who rebuilt the Cylon resurrection technology that had been abandoned when the Thirteenth Tribe gained the ability to procreate Saul and Ellen were married at the time while Tyrol and Foster were in love and planned to marry No Exit

While on Earth the Final Five learned of the upcoming attack on the Colonies from beings Angels only they can see They placed the resurrection technology on a ship in Earth orbit When the nuclear attack kills them they resurrect on the ship and head for the Colonies to warn them They arrive during the First Cylon War unbeknownst to the humans and make a deal with the Centurions stop the war and they will help them build human bodies They build the first model One Cavil who helps them build seven other models Sometimes a Great Notion

Cavil then kills and boxes the Five and removes the memory of their identities from the other Cylons He later unboxes them replacing their memories Cavil periodically seeds them among the human populations starting with Saul and then Ellen to show them the evils of humanity

The Five are fully Cylon  although fundamentally different from the others Unlike the other models they do not have model numbers

Other Cylons do not talk about the Five Torn

Saul Tigh Michael Hogan and Galen Tyrol Aaron Douglas are Galactica officers while Samuel T Anders Michael Trucco is an athlete on Caprica Tory Foster Rekha Sharma is a political operative who is rescued from Caprica and works for Roslin Ellen Tigh Kate Vernon is the fifth member as Saul later realizes as more of his memory returns Sometimes a Great Notion Ellen resurrected after she is poisoned by Saul for giving rescue mission plan to Cavil on New Caprica This restores her memory of her life as a Cylon No Exit

The Five awaken when they begin to hear strange music This seems to affect other Cylons A Raider scans Anders and disengages an attack Aboard Galactica Caprica Six tells Roslin that she can feel the Final Five and that they are near He That Believeth In Me Twos Sixes and Eights believe that the Raiders called off the attack because they sensed the Final Five something with which the Ones Fours and Fives disagree This disagreement leads directly to the Cylon Civil War in which the Twos Sixes and Eights rebel Six of One A standoff between Galactica and the rebel Baseship exposes the four as Cylons to the humans but Lee Adama in his capacity as acting President grants them amnesty as part of an alliance Revelations

Only Anders and Ellen regain their complete memories when Anders gets shot in the head it seems to break Cavils block on his memory while Ellens resurrection restores all of her memories Cavil had planned for the Five to die in the destruction of the Colonies download regain their true memories and apologize for their faith in humanity The Plan Instead four of the Final Five survive the destruction of the Colonies without resurrecting Tigh and Tyrol were on Galactica and Tory and Anders survived through luck while Cavil kept Ellen alive so she could suffer more and learn her lesson Cavils plan thus fails as all of the Five with the possible exception of Foster maintain their loyalty to humanity

They play a major role in ending the second war taking a prominent role in the Battle of The Colony especially Anders who acts as Galacticas Hybrid and shuts down the Colonys weapons and Hybrids The Five also nearly bring a peace between human and Cylon by exchanging resurrection technology which can only be rebuilt by the combined knowledge of the Five for peace

They see each others memories and Tyrol learns that Tory had murdered his wife In a rage he strangles her shattering the temporary peace although a fortuitous nuclear explosion and Cavils subsequent suicide effectively ends the war moments later

After escaping and reaching a new Earth Anders flies the fleet into the Sun destroying it and himself leaving only three of the Final Five alive

The Hybrids resemble human beings inside an immersion tank similar to a Cylon rebirthing tank The Hybrids are cyborgs consisting of conduits and other connectors mated to biological elements The Hybrid is not one of the thirteen models It represents a step on the path from mechanical Centurion to partially biomechanical Raider to Hybrid to skinjob Hybrids are so integrated into the basestars functionality that they are for all practical purposes its brains

Hybrids continually speak what most of the humanoid Cylons consider to be gibberish although there is some difference of opinion on this point Many Cylons believe a hybrids conscious mind is completely mad and the functions it performs are part of a deeper state of mind in connection with the ship Caprica Six states that the Conoy model believes that every word a hybrid says is channeled from the Cylon god A Hybrid is not allowed to vote in the Cylon democratic process though it sometimes objects to the resulting decisions for example leaving another basestar full of diseaseinfected Cylons to their fates

One Hybrid considered the First Hybrid in Cylon lore was the result of experiments on humans during the First Cylon War and appears to be more coherent and prophetic than the others It went rogue as early as the end of the First War and is protected by model 0005 Cylons called Guardians who consider it their god According to the skinjobs the First Hybrid and its Guardians are legends The Colonial Fleet accidentally clashes with the Guardians destroying them the First Hybrid along with its basestar The First Hybrid has the appearance of an old man whereas the standard Hybrids look like young women and are identical

After he is shot in the head and enters a vegetative state Samuel Anders is connected to a datastream and as a result develops Hybridlike abilities whereupon he acts as Galacticas Hybrid When hooked up he speaks and acts like a Hybrid This shows that apparently under special circumstances normal Cylons or at least the Final Five can become Hybridlike beings

The Basestar Hybrids are played by Tiffany LyndallKnight The First Hybrid is played by Campbell Lane

Humanoid Cylons except for the Cavil models follow a monotheistic religion Religious fanaticism partially motivates their attempted genocide of humanity Despite their origins the Cylons believe themselves to be spiritual beings This monotheism seems to share some of the characteristics as the Abrahamic religions belief that God is omniscient omnipotent omnibenevolent that he will one day deliver divine retribution and that he intervenes in the mundane world Their beliefs are different from the Abrahamic religions in that they deal with issues such as consciousness enlightenment and reincarnation

Moore said that this spirituality comes when a species becomes sentient and selfaware  questioning faith and religion and about what happens after death

The different Cylon models have slightly different ways of talking about and dealing with their god reflecting the different aspects of humanity that each Cylon model reflects Ones do not all believe in God and can be agnostic or atheist In contrast Twos are fanatically religious

Some Cylons are physically stronger than humans While this is obvious with respect to Centurions the extent to which the Twelve are also is unclear In the miniseries William Adama fought with a Two who despite suffering from the effects of radiation proved to be stronger The Two managed to break off a metal pipe to use as a club and lift Adama off the floor with one arm Another Two was able to break apart a pair of metal handcuffs while under interrogation Flesh and Bone A Six engaged Kara Thrace handtohand and proved to be exceptionally fast agile and strong Kobols Last Gleaming II Despite this Cylons are vulnerable to most of the same things as humans The Two who fought Adama was beaten to death with a flashlight while the Six who fought Thrace was impaled by a piece of rebar While the Twelve may match or exceed human strength they do not display superhuman powers or resilience Cylon skin appears just as vulnerable to breaking as human skin bleeding just as a comparable wound would in a human

Cylons mental faculties are sufficiently similar to those of a human to allow for manipulation Cain and Thrace exploited this fact while interrogating Cylons The experience of death even with resurrection is traumatic and can leave deep emotional damage

Cylons are susceptible to an ancient virus that can be transmitted by rodents to which humans are immune lymphocytic encephalitis This virus was carried on a beacon left by the Thirteenth Tribe at the Lions Head Nebula millennia before and disrupts all organic Cylon technology including Raiders Hybrids which in turn disrupts Centurions and the skinjobs The humans speculate that the beacon was accidentally contaminated when someone sneezed The Cylons believe that a critical symptom of this virus a harmful bioelectric feedback can be transmitted during a download and attempt to prevent infected Cylons from downloading The only immune Cylon is Athena who had given birth to a halfhuman child and thus inherited human antibodies from her offspring although it is unclear whether she retained this immunity after downloading

Dr Cottle developed a vaccine after some Twelves were infected on a basestar near the Lions Head Nebula The disease requires regular booster shots to keep an infected Cylon healthy The Cylons failed to develop a cure or a vaccine to the virus

Cylons silica pathways are affected by certain forms of radiation such as that surrounding Ragnar Anchorage It is assumed but not stated that this radiation affects all of the skinjobs as the station was chosen as a refuge by Commander Adama before he learned of the existence of biomechanical models The radiation had deleterious effects on the Two they found at Ragnar Anchorage but not on Adama This suggests that humans are not vulnerable to this type of radiation

Plutonium is used for Baltars Cylon Detector because its radiation affects humans and Cylons differently The detector was dropped as a method of exposing hidden Cylons early in Season 2 as the revelation that Boomer a test subject was a Cylon convinced the command staff that the detector did not work

Shaw was first introduced to music by her uncle Jimmy Burgess a jazz trumpet player In an interview with The New York Times she told the reporter He Jimmy Burgess introduced me to good music through records  Dizzy Gillespie Miles Davis a lot of gospel things and Al Hibbler who really knows how to phrase a song In 1952 Burgess brought her on stage at the Apollo Theater in Harlem to sing with his band Shaws mother did not want Marlena to go on tour with her uncle at such a young age Instead she enrolled Shaw into the New York State Teachers College in Potsdam now known as the State University of New York at Potsdam to study music She later dropped out of school got married and had five children but never gave up her singing career

Shaw began to make singing appearances in jazz clubs whenever she could spare the time The most notable of these appearances was in 1963 when she worked with jazz trumpeter Howard McGhee She was supposed to play at the Newport Jazz Festival with McGhee and his band but left the group after getting into an argument with one of the band members Later that year she got an audition with Columbia label talent scout John Hammond Shaw did not perform well during the audition because she was too nervous Undeterred she continued to play small clubs until 1966 Her career took off in 1966 when she landed a gig with the Playboy Club chain in Chicago It was through this gig that she met with representatives of the Chess Records music label and soon signed with them She released her first two albums on their subsidiary Cadet Records A 1969 album track California Soul a funksoul tune written by Ashford  Simpson and originally issued as a single by American pop quintet The 5th Dimension later became a staple of the UK rare groove scene This song has appeared in television commercials for Dockers KFC and Dodge Ram trucks Because of television advert exposure it may be Shaws best known recording in the UK Unable to find her own style at Chess she moved to the jazzoriented Blue Note Records in 1972

In 1977 she released an LP Sweet Beginnings on Columbia that contained arguably Shaws finest moment Yu Ma  Go Away Little Boy a medley containing the old Goffin and Carole King standard originally recorded by Nancy Wilson The album also contained the track Look At Me Look At You popular on the UK rare groove scene She also recorded one of the disco eras biggest hits a remake of Touch Me in the Morning also on Columbia Records

In 1982 Marlena recorded the Gary Taylor ballad called Without You In My Life from the LP Let Me In Your Life that was jointly produced by Johnny Bristol and Webster Lewis on South Bay records This had moderate chart success in the USA In 1983 she recorded the vocals for Could It Be You a track by Phil Upchurch on his Name Of The Game album

Shaw still performs and records today In 2001 and again in 2007 Shaw was one of the performers at the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands

Faltonia Betitia Proba
Faltonia Betitia Proba c AD 306315  c 353366 was a Latin Roman Christian poet perhaps the earliest female Christian poet whose work survives A member of one of the most influential aristocratic families she composed the Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi a cento composed with verses by Virgil reordered to form an epic poem centred on the life of Jesus

Proba belonged to an influential family of the 4th century the Petronii Probi Her father was Petronius Probianus Roman consul in 322 while her mother was probably called Demetria She had a brother Petronius Probinus appointed consul in 341 also her grandfather Pompeius Probus had been a consul in 310 Proba married Clodius Celsinus Adelphus praefectus urbi of Rome in 351 thus creating a bond with the powerful gens Anicia They had at least two sons Quintus Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius and Faltonius Probus Alypius who became high imperial officers She also had a granddaughter Anicia Faltonia Proba daughter of Olybrius and Tirrania Anicia Juliana

Her family was pagan but Proba converted to Christianity when she was an adult influencing her husband and her sons who converted after her Proba died before Celsinus She was probably buried with her husband in the Basilica di SantAnastasia al Palatino in Rome where until the 16th century there was their funerary inscription later moved to Villa Borghese before disappearing The bond between Proba and this church might be related to Saint Anastasia who probably belonged to the gens Anicia Proba and Celsinus could have received the honour of being buried ad sanctos next to the tomb of a saint because of the particular veneration of the Anicii for this saint

With her husband she owned the Horti Aciliorum at Rome on the Pincian Hill

Two poems are attributed to Proba and only one is extant Most modern scholars identify Faltonia Betitia Proba as the author of these works with the other possible identification being her niece Anicia Faltonia Proba

The first poem now lost is called Constantini bellum adversus Magnentium The War of Constantine against Magnentius by the Codex Mutinensis It dealt with the war between Roman Emperor Constantius II and the usurper Magnentius Proba was involved to this war through her husband Clodius Celsinus Adelphus who had been praefectus urbi of Rome in 351 that the same year Italy passed from the sphere of influence of Magnetius to Constantius after the Battle of Mursa Major

The existence of this first poem is based on the first verses of the second poem Here Proba rejects her first Pagan composition and scholars think that the Pagan poem was destroyed according to her will

Probas most famous work is a Virgilian centoa patchwork of verses extracted from several works of Virgil with minimal modificationsentitled Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi A Virgilian Cento Concerning the Glory of Christ The 694 lines are divided into a proemium with invocation lines 155 episodes from the Old Testament lines 56345 episodes from the New Testament lines 346688 and an epilogue lines 689694

Universities Space Research Association
The Universities Space Research Association USRA was incorporated on March 12 1969 in Washington DC as a private nonprofit corporation under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences NAS Institutional membership in the association has grown from 49 colleges and universities when it was founded to the current 105 institutions All member institutions have graduate programs in space sciences or technology Besides the 95 member institutions in the United States there are two member institutions in Canada four in Europe two in Israel one in Australia and one in Hong Kong

USRA provides a mechanism through which universities can cooperate effectively with one another with the government and with other organizations to further space science and technology and to promote education in these areas Its mission is carried out through the institutes centers divisions and programs Administrative and scientific personnel now number about 420 A unique feature of USRAs management is its system of standing panels of technical experts drawn from the research community to provide oversight for USRAs institutes centers divisions and programs

USRAs origins extend back to 1966 when the NASA Administrator requested the help of the NAS in forming a national consortium to assume management of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory The president of the NAS Dr Frederick Seitz first turned to the Universities Research Association URA which had recently been created to operate the National Accelerator Laboratory Seitz raised the issue of NASAs involvement at a URA meeting in the fall of 1966 However because of budgetary concerns with the National Accelerator Laboratory URA did not wish to assume any additional responsibilities

To satisfy its immediate needs NASA took upon itself the management of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory but left open the possibility of wider participation of the academic community through an institute At this time the idea of a Lunar Science Institute LSI took form To develop further the concept of the LSI the NAS created a committee under the chairmanship of Dr Kenneth Pitzer to study NASAUniversity Relations In the fall of 1967 the Pitzer Committee recommended the establishment of the LSI initially to be operated by Rice University under a subcontract with the NAS but eventually to be operated by a university consortium The Pitzer committee concluded that the pattern established at LSI could form the basis for the development of a much broader link between NASA and the academic community

On March 1 1968 President Lyndon Johnson announced the creation of the Lunar Science Institute LSI and USRA was chartered the following year as the parent organization of LSI The initial headquarters of USRA was at the University of Virginia where Professor A R Kuhlthau served as the first president of the association

In 1976 Dr Alexander J Dessler became the second USRA president Dessler moved the headquarters of the association to Rice University where he served as chairman of the Department of Space Physics and Astronomy

In 1978 USRA headquarters moved to Columbia Maryland

Dr David C Black was appointed USRA president in 2000 Black served as director of USRAs Lunar and Planetary Institute from 1988 to 2001 and is internationally recognized for research in theoretical astrophysics and planetary science

Dr Jeffrey Isaacson was named president and CEO of USRA effective October 20 2014

USRA initially concentrated on the management of Lunar Science Institute later renamed the Lunar and Planetary Institute but armed with its broad charter the consortium began to explore other ways to serve the university space research community as early as 1970 Today USRA researchers are involved with university government and industry scientists and engineers in a broad array of space and aeronautics related fields including astronomy and astrophysics earth sciences microgravity life sciences space technology computer science and advanced concepts

Most USRA research activities include related educational components

MG WA
The MG WA is a sporting saloon that was produced by MG between 1938 and 1939 and was at the time the largest and heaviest car the company had built Although similar to the SA the car had a wider track at the rear allowing a larger body to be fitted

The car used a tuned version of the sixcylinder Morris QPHG engine enlarged to 2561cc The compression ratio was increased to 725 to 1 and a new balanced crankshaft was fitted Drive was to the live rear axle via a fourspeed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top three ratios and a divided propshaft Wire wheels were fitted and the 14 inch drum brakes were hydraulically operated using a Lockheed system 

The saloon body was made inhouse by Morris and was a spacious fourdoor with traditional MG grille flanked by two large chrome plated headlights It can be distinguished from the outwardly similar SA by the front bumper which has a dip in the centre and the spare wheel was carried on the front wing as opposed to the boot lid Inside there were individual seats in front and a bench seat with folding centre arm rest at the rear all with leather covering and a return was made to the traditional octagonal framed instruments 

The factory could also supply the car from their catalogue as a Tickford drophead coup built by Salmons and Son or fourdoor tourer by Charlesworth and some chassis went to other coachbuilders including Kellner of Paris and Reinbolt of Switzerland The saloon was priced at GBP442 the fourseat tourer GBP450 and the Tickford coup GBP468

Production stopped with the outbreak of World War II in 1939 and the car was not reintroduced in 1945

Fiddler ray
Trygonorrhina also known as the fiddler rays or banjo rays is a genus of guitarfish family Rhinobatidae The two species are found along the eastern and southern coasts of Australia They are benthic in nature favoring shallow sandy bays rocky reefs and seagrass beds The eastern fiddler is found to a depth of 120 m and the southern fiddler to a depth of 180 m

The flattened pectoral fin discs of fiddler rays are shorter and more rounded than those of other guitarfishes Their tails are slender with a welldeveloped caudal fin and two triangular dorsal fins Their snouts are translucent The fiddler rays are also distinguished from other guitarfishes in that the anterior nasal flaps of their nostrils are expanded backwards and fused together into a nasal curtain that reaches the mouth

Fiddler rays feed on bottoms shellfish crabs and worms which they crush between their jaws The eastern fiddler ray is known to scavenge from fish traps Like other guitarfishes fiddler rays are ovoviviparous The egg capsules of the southern fiddler ray are reported to be golden in colour containing three embryos each It gives birth to litters of four to six young per breeding cycle Fiddler rays are harmless and easily approached by divers Southern fiddler rays are taken as bycatch by commercial trawlers and by recreational fishers the flesh is of good quality and sold in small quantities
The Magpie fiddler ray previously Trygonorrhina melaleuca is now considered a variant of Trygonorrhina dumerilii

There are currently 2 recognized species in this genus

douard Chavannes
mmanueldouard Chavannes 5 October 1865  29 January 1918 was a French Sinologist and expert on Chinese history and religion and is best known for his translations of major segments of Sima Qians Records of the Grand Historian the works first ever translation into a Western language

Chavannes was a prolific and influential scholar and was one of the most accomplished Sinologists of the modern era notwithstanding his relatively early death at age 52 in 1918 A successor of 19th century French sinologists JeanPierre AbelRmusat and Stanislas Julien Chavannes was largely responsible for the development of Sinology and Chinese scholarship into a respected field in the realm of French science

douard Chavannes was born on 5 October 1865 in Lyon France As a youth he studied at the lyce in Lyon where like most students of his era his education focused mainly on the Latin and Greek Classics Chavannes was then sent to Paris to attend the prestigious Lyce LouisleGrand where he and his classmates studied and prepared for the entrance exams to one of the French Grandes coles Chavannes passed his entrance exams and was admitted to the Lettres literature section of the cole Normale Suprieure in 1885 Chavannes spent three years at the school finishing in 1888 after successfully passing his agrgation in philosophy

Georges Perrot a French archaeologist and newly appointed director of the cole Normale Suprieure advised Chavannes to begin studying China after he finished his schooling Chavannes first considered studying Chinese philosophy which was nearer to his own educational background but on the advice of the French scholar Henri Cordier he ultimately decided to focus on Chinese history which up to that time had been much less widely studied in the West Chavannes began attending Classical Chinese courses given by the Marquis dHerveySaintDenys at the Collge de France and the Mandarin Chinese classes of Maurice Jametel 18561889 at the cole des Langues Orientales Vivantes School of Living Oriental Languages Desiring to advance his studies with actual experience in China Chavannes used the connections of certain friends of his to obtain a position as an attach to a scientific mission associated with the French Legation in Peking modern Beijing He departed for China in January 1889 and arrived two months later As a sinologist Chavannes took the Chinese name Sha Wan  and the courtesy name Zilan  and he also had an art name Shicheng Boshi  The Doctor of Lyon
In 1891 Chavannes briefly returned to France where he married Alice Dor the daughter of a wellknown optometrist in Lyon before returning to China with her Together they had a son Fernand Henri Chavannes who later became a highly decorated flying ace during World War I and two daughters

Chavannes stayed in China until 1893 when he returned to France to take up the position of Professor of Chinese at the Collge de France which had been vacated upon the death of the Marquis dHerveySaintDenys in November 1892 Although Chavannes had only been studying Chinese for five years the quality and value of his early Chinese scholarship had already been widely recognized in the academic community and convinced the regents of the Collge de France to give the position to him Chavannes opened his tenure with a lecture entitled Du Rle social de la littrature chinoise On the Social Role of Chinese Literature During his tenure at the Collge Chavannes was widely active in French academic circles he was a member of the Institut de France was an honorary member of a number of foreign societies served as a French coeditor of the noted sinological journal Toung Pao from 1904 until 1916 and was elected President of the Academie des Inscriptions et BellesLettres in 1915

Chavanness granddaughter Claire Chavannes had a son with physicist Paul Langevins grandson Bernard Langevin the french mathematician Remi Langevin

Chavannes first scholarly publication Le Trait sur les sacrifices Fong et Chan de Sema Tsien traduit en franais Sima Qians Treatise on the Feng and Shan Sacrifices Translated into French which was published in 1890 while he was in Beijing inspired him to begin a translation of Sima Qians Records of the Grand Historian Shiji  the first of Chinas dynastic histories The first volume of the translation was published in Paris in 1895 and begins with a 249page introduction which the German anthropologist Berthold Laufer described as a masterpiece of historical and critical analysis not surpassed by anything of this character written before or after him Chavannes produced four additional volumes between 1896 and 1905 covering 47 of the 130 chapters of the Records and complete with full commentary and indices His translations also include a large number of appendices covering topics of special interests

Chavannes was major pioneer in the field of modern epigraphy and was praised by Berthold Laufer as the first European scholar who approached this difficult subject with sound and critical methods and undisputed success His first epigraphical article Les Inscriptions des Tsin Qin Inscriptions was published in Journal Asiatique in 1893 which was followed later by a number of works in which Chavannes was the first Western scholar to successfully analyze and translate the unusual epigraphical style of the Mongolruled Yuan dynasty Chavannes returned to China in 1907 to study ancient monuments and inscriptions taking hundreds of photographs and rubbings that were published in 1909 in a large album entitled Mission archologique dans la Chine septentrionale Archaeological Mission to Northern China He published two volumes of translations and analysis of the inscription material before his death La Sculpture  lpoque des Han Sculpture in the Han Era published in 1913 and La Sculpture bouddhique Buddhist Sculpture published in 1915

Chavannes was intrigued by and performed extensive research into the major religions of ancient and medieval China Chinese folk religion Buddhism Daoism Nestorian Christianity and Manichaeism His Mmoire compos  lpoque de la grande dynastie Tang sur les religieux minents qui allrent chercher la loi dans les pays doccident par ITsing Memoir Written in the Grand Tang Dynasty by Yijing on the Religious Men Who Went to Search for the Law in the Western Lands which was published in 1894 and won the Prix Julien contains translations of the biographies and travelogues of sixty Buddhist monks who journeyed from China to India during the Tang dynasty in search of Buddhist scriptures and Sanskrit books Chavannes bestknown work on Chinese Buddhism is his threevolume work Cinq cents contes et apologues extraits du Tripiaka chinois Five Hundred Tales and Fables from the Chinese Tripiaka

Chavannes 1910 book Le Tai Chan essai de monographie dun culte chinois Tai Shan Monographic Essay on a Chinese Cult is a detailed study of the indigenous Chinese folk religion which predates Buddhism and religious Daoism and focuses on an ancient mountain cult centered on Mt Tai that Chavannes visited personally This monumental work begins with introductory essays on the generally sacred role of mountains in Chinese history and culture then examines the personality of Mt Tai itself in great detail Chavannes includes translations of dozens of relevant passages from ancient medieval and premodern Chinese literature including comments and passages gathered by medieval scholars Zhu Xi and Gu Yanwu His study also includes eleven translations from rubbings of stone inscriptions Chavannes made himself in temples he visited on and around Mt Tai as well as a detailed handdrawn topographic map of the mountain that Chavannes drew himself Chavannes style in Le Tai Chan with his annotated translations extensive commentary and exhaustively researched sources was inspirational and influential to later French sinologists

In 1912 Chavannes and his former student Paul Pelliot edited and translated a Chinese Manichaean treatise that Pelliot had discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the Mogao caves The book published in Paris as Un trait manichen retrouv en Chine A Manichaean Treatise Found in China was praised by Berthold Laufer upon Chavannes death in 1918 as perhaps the most brilliant achievement in modern sinology

French Frith Kaiser Thompson
French Frith Kaiser Thompson was a United StatesEnglish experimental rock quartet comprising John French Fred Frith Henry Kaiser and Richard Thompson The band was formed in 1987 to create an album Live Love Larf  Loaf In 1990 they recorded their second album Invisible Means and performed live in Berkeley California to promote this album

Experimental American musicians guitarist Henry Kaiser and drummer John French Drumbo from Captain Beefhearts Magic Band began collaborating in 1987 They invited English musicians Fred Frith experimental guitarist from Henry Cow and Richard Thompson folkrock guitarist from Fairport Convention to join them to make an album

They recorded Live Love Larf  Loaf in San Francisco in March 1987 an eclectic collection of songs drawn from a variety of music genres including folk RB and avantgarde rock Most of the album comprised compositions from each of the members of the group plus a few covers including The Beach Boys Surfin USA

While the group experimented with folk and rock music it is generally felt that Thompsons presence did tone down the avantgarde leanings of the other three musicians Mark Deming states in AllMusic that  the slightly bent wit and angular guitar figures of Richard Thompsons signature brand of folkrock certainly added a spoonful of sugar that helped the avantleaning art rock of Henry Kaiser Fred Frith and John French go down more easily

The group reassembled in San Francisco in March 1990 to record Invisible Means another collection of skewed songs from each of the members plus one cover Loch Lomond

Little Switzerland landscape
A little Switzerland or Schweiz is a landscape often of wooded hills This Romantic aesthetic term is not a geographic category but was widely used in the 19th century to connote dramatic natural scenic features that would be of interest to tourists Since it was ambiguous from the very beginning it was flexibly used in travel writing to imply that a landscape had some features though on a much smaller scale that might remind a visitor of Switzerland

The original generic term was applied to dozens of locations in Europe the bulk of them Germanspeaking as well as to other parts of the world to direct attention to rock outcrops that stand out usually amid steep forest The original 18thcentury comparison was usually with the fissured crags of the Jura Mountains on the FrancoSwiss border which hardly rise higher than 1700 metres 

Histories of Saxon Switzerland Schsische Schweiz in Saxony Germany assert that the landscape description schweiz arose there at the end of the 18th century Schweiz is the Germanlanguage name of Switzerland The term was used both alone and with the prefix little for example in the title of an 1820 German booklength poem Die kleine Schweiz by Jakob Reiselsberger which praised the rocky scenery of a part of Franconia in Germany known thereafter as the Franconian Switzerland Frnkische Schweiz

The term was already colloquial by this time in English in 1823 a correspondent asserted in The Gentlemans Magazine that a steep area by the road outside Petersfield in southern England was a little Switzerland The aesthetic term to describe picturesque exposed rock and steepness rather than altitude was also in common use in other European languages including the French term Suisse Rocks and wild landscapes were a favoured theme in Romantic painting

The many English places praised in 19thcentury promotional literature as little Switzerland include Church Stretton Whitfield and the coastal area around the North Devon twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth Chaletstyle buildings were sometimes erected to emphasize little Switzerland pretensions for example at Matlock Bath which unusually for England also features a cable car

From the beginning the term was often understood as a comparison to the snowcapped Alps rather than to the Jura The following passage describing Wales appears in an 1831 Englishlanguage edition of MalteBruns Universal Geography which had originally been written in French in 180307 

Describing the Atlantic island of St Helena in A New Voyage Round the World 182326 Otto von Kotzebue and Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz were translated into English as writing 

In the United States the raw White Mountains of New Hampshire which were soon to be one of the definitive subjects of American Romantic painting were termed a little Switzerland by travel writer Henry Tudor as early as 1832

In the later 19th century authors and tourism promoters would praise picturepostcard summer scenery of woods and low hills reflected in blue lakes as a little Switzerland or schweiz Whereas the earlier use had implied a landscape of dangers this was a term for beauty 

This usage reflected today in the official geographical terms for the Holstein Switzerland Holsteinische Schweiz and Mecklenburg Switzerland Mecklenburgische Schweiz in Germany where there are neither mountains nor outcrops is difficult to account for but may refer to prestigious Swiss lakeside tourist destinations such as Zurich Lucerne or Interlaken or to Lakes Geneva and Constance

The term has often appeared anachronistic since travel to Switzerland became affordable By the 21st century it was common for observers to express puzzlement that the little Switzerland label applied at all to regions such as the Suisse Normande or to the Holstein Switzerland where the flat hilltops are no more than 150 metres above the lake surfaces

In 1992 the Swiss Tourism Federation counted more than 190 places round the world that had at least for some period been named after Switzerland either because of a fancied scenic resemblance in jest or referring to a banking haven political neutrality or habitation by Swiss emigrants No fewer than 67 places in neighbouring Germany were said by the Federation to have adopted little Switzerland names 

While the byname has fallen out of fashion in some places it persists as the official geographical name for several administrative regions and national parks including with dates of legal designation

Business promotion regions using the name without legally defined boundaries include

Notable privately developed properties known by the name include

In English Little Switzerland is usually said without any definite article or additional adjective but often with a genitive modifier if there are several little Switzerlands within one nation eg North Carolinas Little Switzerland In European languages where Switzerland proper takes a definite article little Switzerlands do likewise Their English names may echo the vernacular being capitalized and modified to the English alphabet sometimes taking an English definite article eg the Saechsische Schweiz die Schsische Schweiz and the Suisse Normande la Suisse normande English forms are also widespread eg Holstein Switzerland Dickinson 1964 Swiss Franconia Michelin 1993 Franconian Switzerland Fodor 1962 and Bolt 2005

Battle of Karanovasa
The Battle of Karanovasa lit Battle of the Trenches took place on 10 October 1394 between the Wallachian army led by Voivode Mircea cel Btrn against an Ottoman invasion led by Sultan Bayezid I This battle is sometimes confused with the later Battle of Rovine lit Battle of the Marshes Rovine is old RomanianLatin for ruins modern Italian rovinare to tear down between the same combatants and which took place also along the valley of the Arge River

The Ottoman Empire emerged as a small principality in the early fourteenth century in the northwestern part of the Anatolian Peninsula In the following decades the Ottoman Sultans combined their growing military strength with astute dynastic politics to expand their territory eastwards into the whole of Anatolia and westwards into the Balkan Peninsula Thus in 1387 Murad I 136289 conquered much of Greece and fought a large Christian army at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 In the early 1390s his successor Bayezid I 13891402 established his suzerainty over Stefan Lazarevi of Serbia the Turnovo Bulgaria of Ivan Shishman and the Vidin Despotate of Ivan Sratsimir The Ottoman Empire had become one of the most important powers in the Balkans threatening the remaining independent states of central Europe Wallachia Moldavia the Kingdom of Hungary as well as the Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea Mircea of Wallachia previously secured an alliance with several Karamanid princes of Anatolia which antagonized Bayezid I Yet Bayezid despite defeating the Karamanids had to plan and act every action carefully since he had more enemies than friends among the Muslim Turkish aristocracy and could not simply turn around and declare a new holy war against those whose troops helped the Karamanid princes in Anatolia His opportunity came when the Wallachians and the Hungarians invaded the weak states from the south of the Danube which were vassals of Bayezid The Wallachians occupied the Principality of Karvuna and the city of Silistra apparently with the consent of Ivan Shishman while the Hungarians tried to conquer the Vidin Despotate These infringements on his vassals lands gave Bayezid authority to move

Returning from Asia Minor to the Balkans in 1393 the Sultan expelled the Wallachians from Silistra and the Dobruja and declared that Turnovo Tsardom unable to fend for herself was now an Ottoman pashalik The final attack on Wallachia was to take place

In the autumn of 1394 after a raiding campaign along the right bank of the Danube Bayezid launched the attack on Wallachia He commanded the Ottoman Rumelian army and the armies of his Balkan vassals most of which were Bulgarians and Serbs under Stefan Lazarevi the son of the late Serbian prince Lazar The armies crossed the Danube at Nicopolis at advanced along the Arge River with the intention of capturing Curtea de Arge the capital city of Wallachia After a weeklong march in which the constant attacks Wallachian took their toll the Wallachian army met the Ottoman one on October 10 The Wallachians launched a sudden ambush from the forests slowly pushing the Ottomans closely to the bank of the Arge River The bloodiest fighting took place around the Ottoman camp strengthened with earth walls palisades and ditches hendek in Turkish Hence the name with which this battle appears in Serbian chronicles as the Battle of the Trenches of Karanovasa Surrounded the Ottomans managed to resist until the dawn when Bayiezid hardly managed to escape the battle fleeing over the Danube Nevertheless most of his and his vassals armies perished

It would turn out that his vassals suffered more from the Sultans help than they did from the Wallachians and Hungarians The Turnovo Tsardom not only ceased its existence but Ivan Shishman was accused of collaboration with the enemy and was executed at the orders of the Sultan Bayezid spent the winter and the spring warring in Anatolia with Seljuk princes besieging Constantinople and leaving the lands south of the Danube in the hands of Mircea who by now managed to provoke an antiOttoman rebellion as far south as Rumelia

A much better prepared attack in which the entire Ottoman army as well as the whole of the Ottoman vassals took part was started by the Sultan in spring in May 1395 The alliance documents signed at Braov on March 7 between Mircea and Sigismund of Luxembourg reveal that by 1395 a huge concentration of Ottoman forces took place in the southern Dobruja The Ottoman army launched a twodirectional attack via Nicopolis and via VidinCraiova Another Ottoman army group led by Vlad I of Wallachia Mirceas nephew who was attempting to take the throne with Turkish support was invading along the Ialomia River Faced with a much larger force Mircea applied guerrilla tactics and delayed direct confrontation with the Ottoman army until he received help from his ally Sigismund The final confrontation would take place at the Battle of Rovine lit Battle of the Marshes

The University of Iowa began offering creative writing courses in 1897 and began using the term writing workshop in 1939 by the 1970s hundreds of writing workshops were offered by colleges libraries and private groups Scott B Kaufman and James Kaufman describe a brutal atmosphere in educational and professional writing circles that was often masked as critique Starting in the 1970s a popular reaction to this culture emerged as individual teachers sought new ways to teach creative writing

Schneider began to develop the AWA method for teaching writing in workshops and other groups in 1979 Working with a community of writers in Amherst Massachusetts she explored ways to conduct a writing classworkshop that would honor the primary voice encouraging students to trust what the writer John Edgar Wideman has called the language of home She further cites the writer Paule Marshall who has written When people at readings and writers conferences ask me who my major influences were I always acknowledge before all others the group of women around the table long ago They taught me my first lessons in the narrative art They trained my ear They set a standard of excellence This is why the best of my work must be attributed to them it stands as testimony to the rich legacy of language and culture they so freely passed on to me in the wordshop of the kitchen

In 1985 Schneider offered workshops to women living in public housing in Chicopee Massachusetts On Sunday nights for the past eight years the Chicopee Writing Workshop has been changing lives The most important change Pat says is the way the women see themselves Schneider chose to develop the workshop for women in public housing because she believes there is no difference between the rich and the poor in this writing is art and our own stories are the stuff of which our freedom is made our self esteem our power

In 1990 Schneiders workshops became so popular Schneider had to encourage some of her students to break away and start their own groups using her techniques Beginning in 2004 Schneider began training other writers to become workshop leaders Over 1000 writers are now recognized as AWAcertified workshop leaders who have led workshops in the United States Canada Europe Africa and the Middle East Workshops are built around a set of essential affirmations and practices

Stevens Creek Heritage Preserve
Stevens Creek Heritage Preserve is a nature preserve in the US State of South Carolina It is managed by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources It covers in McCormick County and Edgefield County and was established to protect rare animal and plant species Websters Salamander and Miccosukee gooseberry are among the species which have few populations outside the preserve The nearest population center is Clarks Hill about two road miles 34km to the southwest

The site was identified in 1957 by Albert E Radford of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill He noticed exceptional diversity in the tree shrub and herb layers on the bluffs overlooking Stevens Creek and documented six plant species which had been unknown in South Carolina up to that time Another five species were known from only one other South Carolina location Many of these rare species were plentiful at the site and remain prominent there today A remarkable feature of this plant community is that a palmetto Sabal minor occurs near northern inland wildflowers such as Asarum canadense Four trillium species are also present

Soils of the bluffs were found to be atypical for South Carolina Most of the states soils are acidic with pH near or below 5 However some topsoils in the preserve had pH readings near 7  neutral on the scale This is more typical of baserich sites in Appalachian coves and the Midwest where many plants rare to South Carolina are abundant These soils correspond most closely to the Cartecay and Toccoa series which are loam or sandy loamtextured Entisols Along Stevens Creek are alluvial silt loam Inceptisols of the Riverview series The majority of the preserve away from the bluffs is underlain by acidic sandy loam Ultisols of the Cataula Hiwassee Louisburg and Pacolet series typical of the South Carolina Piedmont These upland soils support mixed pine and hardwood forest over most of the preserve except in the southwest corner which has pure stands of pine

<doc id="7708681" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7708681" title="Enchirito">
Enchirito
Enchirito  is the trademarked name of Taco Bells menu item of the TexMex food similar to an enchilada It is composed of a flour tortilla filled with seasoned ground beef taco meat with options to substitute steak or chicken beans diced onions cheddar cheese and red sauce

There is an unsubstantiated claim that the Enchirito was invented in 1967 by a high school student in Montebello CA

However a 2008 article published in the Long Beach PressTelegram claimed that a Cerritos California based franchise owner named Dan Jones had created the Enchirito

In an article published in a Corsicana Daily Sun in 1971 there is a third claim that a Taco Bell franchise owner in Texas was the actual inventor

The original Enchirito of the 1970s was advertised as a special tortilla filled with ground beef pinto beans and onions topped with red sauce cheese and olives It was served in a reheatable aluminum foil tray One of the earliest print reference to the Enchirito is an August 1967 Taco Bell ad in an Amarillo Texas newspaper for a meal consisting of a taco Enchirito and soft drink for 089

Taco Bell registered the name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a service mark in May 1970 In its application Taco Bell described the item as a  Combination Enchilada And Burrito Prepared As Part Of  Restaurant Services and that Enchirito Is Merely A Fanciful Combination Of Enchilada And Burrito

The coining of the name Enchirito a portmanteau of the words enchilada and burrito for this item was a bit of a peculiar action by Taco Bell It was the only item on the menu at the time to not use the common Mexican food nomenclature for that item Whereas a burrito is typically a flour tortilla filled with beans and an enchilada is typically a corn tortilla filled with meat and smothered in chile sauce the name Enchirito communicates the combination of these elements On the other hand it appears the unusual name was not to help Americans unfamiliar with the Spanish names of the food items indeed for many years Taco Bell menu boards featured a system of phonetic pronunciation guides next to each item

Even after the Enchirito was officially discontinued in 1993 some customers still ordered them and word spread through the Internet that many restaurants would still make them with the ingredients they had available Due to this underground popularity it was decided to bring it back and commercials featuring the Taco Bell chihuahua promoting the Enchirito began airing on December 26 1999 with later commercials in mid2000 featuring the rapping or singing styles of the five guys with no talent However some things about the item had changed The serving container had become a coated pressedpaper oblong bowl when dining in or a black plastic bowl with a clear plastic lid if ordering from the drivethru Most significantly the character of the dish was altered by changing the yellow corn masa tortilla to a white wheat flour tortilla The sliced olives were omitted The chicken Enchirito and the steak Enchirito which respectively substitute chicken or steak for the ground beef were also introduced as options The Enchirito is served with a plastic spork
The Enchirito was once again discontinued when Taco Bell introduced the Smothered Burrito on July 25 2013 While it may not be currently seen on the menu it can be requested when ordering

A typical ground beef enchirito contains 209 calories 17 grams of fat 8 grams saturated 45 milligrams cholesterol and 1110 milligrams of sodium

There is yet another legend associated with Parthasarathy here During the battle of Kurukshetra Duryodhana had taunted Bheeshma of not using his full might in fighting the Pandavas This taunt by Duryodhana filled Bheeshma with rage Bheeshma took a vow to fight with such ferocity the next day that Lord Krishna himself would be forced to break his vow of not using a weapon during the war in order to protect Arjuna On the ninth day of the battle of Kurukshetra the Kauravas reigned supreme under the leadership of Bheeshma when Krishna motivated Arjuna to take initiative and vanquish his foe Bheeshma was unparalleled with the use of celestial weapons in such a manner that Arjuna could not counter the onslaught Arrows after arrows fired from Bheeshmas bow breached the defenses of Arjuna and inflicted wounds to his body by penetrating his armour The string of Arjunas bow the Gandiva was snapped during the battle Seeing Arjunas plight Krishna jumped down in rage and took up his discus charging towards Bheeshma Bheeshma was overfilled with joy and surrendered to Lord Krishna Meanwhile Arjuna beseeched the Lord not to kill Bheeshma as it would have been against Krishnas vow to take up arms in his battle It is believed that it is this image of Krishna that is enshrined here with a discus This symbolizes the Lords act of compassion to both his devotees on either side of the battle Lord Krishna broke his vow to protect Arjuna and also to fulfill the promise that his ardent devotee Bheeshma had made

Lord Krishna presiding here in the Vishvarupa form is considered as Annadana Prabhu The Lord who provides food along with other temples like Vaikom Mahadeva Temple and Sabarimala It is believed that those whose Annaprashana is performed at the Aranmula Parthasarathy temple would never be affected by the pangs of poverty throughout their life

APO Hiking Society
The Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society later popularly known as APO Hiking Society or simply APO was a Filipino musical group The group had its fledgling beginnings in 1969 at the Ateneo de Manila high school with 15 members John Paul Micayabas Lito de Joya Sonny Santiago Gus Cosio Renato Garcia Chito Kintanar Kenny Barton Bruce Brown Butch Dans Kinjo Sawada Ric Segreto Goff Macaraeg Doden Besa Jim Jakolero Paredes and Boboy Garovillo The groups name was created from the acronym AMHS representing their school with a witty twist having an irreverent reference to the paralyzed Philippine revolutionary intellectual and hero Apolinario Mabini and later shortened to Apo an Ilocano term for a wise man or a Tagalog term of grandchildren and later rebranded to APO all caps Contrary to popular belief the Apo name was not a reference to the Philippiness highest peak the potentiallyactive stratovolcano Mount Apo

As the students advanced into college Danny Javier joined the group After graduation the majority of its members left to pursue individual careers with only three members remaining made up of Jim Jakolero Paredes Boboy Garovillo and Danny Javier

In the span of their professional career Apo emerged as a principal adherent of the musical movement termed Original Pilipino Music aka OPM a milieu in which their original musical contributions and cultural influence became essential The Apo became involved in record production talent management and organizing artists under the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mangaawit OPM  The group expanded its activities into establishing and furthering the careers of new OPM artists in the Philippines

To date the group has released 27 albums in four decades of its career Two hugely successful tribute albums were produced in 2006 and 2007 by its management group featuring numerous young bands freshly reinterpreting Apos expansive repertoire

The group frequently utilized their brand name Apo as a clever component for Tagalog puns in titles for television shows live programs and marketing materials for example as in nA PO which transliterates as already politeformal usage and also as ap meaning grandchild The puns have been minimally extended into English as in APOcalyptic 

The Name Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society was meant to be deliberately ironic since the historical figure Apolinario Mabini famously lost the use of his legs to polio

The Apo Hiking Society first gained recognition in 1973 when they gave a farewell concert at the Meralco Theater in Pasig City Metro Manila Philippines Just out of college the group was the talk of the Ateneo de Manila University and adjoining campuses for their music and humor

It was only when two of its four members were about to retire from the field of amateur music however that the APO then known as the Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society finally had a citywide audience One of them was scheduled to leave for Turkey as an exchange student The other had a position waiting for him in his fathers advertising firm

The trip to Turkey did not materialize and the APO now a tentative trio pushed on steadily towards fame and fortune

In late 1978 APO Hiking Society nearly disbanded after Jim Jakolero Paredes stormed out a songwriting session While asking Danny Javier for a 3 syllable word to fill in a line he was provided the word katapusan a 4 syllable word The error went unnoticed until post recording where an irate Paredes noticed that the word had indeed one extra syllable more than what he had originally intended

Looking back the APO members Danny Javier and Boboy Garrovillo do not regret never having been regular wage earners Their farewell concert which had SRO audiences for two stormy nights not unexpectedly became a hit record the following year

In the three decades since that farewell concert the APO has made 22 record albums hosted several television shows including their own noontime Sunday show Sa Linggo nAPO Sila and noontime show from Monday to Saturday Sang Linggo nAPO Sila and launched hugely successful major solo concerts and countless provincial dinner and corporate shows They have performed in over 50 cities in the United States in Canada Singapore Indonesia Germany Switzerland Italy and Japan to bring Original Pilipino Music to Filipinos the world over

In 1978 APO won 2nd Place winner in the Metro Manila Popular Song Festival now MetroPop Song Festival in 1996 to 2003 for their runnerup song Ewan the song was composed by Louie Ocampo

In October 1987 during their annual US tour the APO became the first Filipino pop artists with Marco Sison to perform at the Main Hall of New Yorks prestigious Carnegie Hall They also performed at the equally prestigious Massey Hall in Toronto Canadas music capital Both concerts as well as the other shows held during that particular concert tour were sold out The APO were also the first Filipino artists to perform in a public concert in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia In 1987 they were one of the first Filipino artists to be recorded on compact disc And in 1994 they were awarded the first Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino by Awit Awards  the Filipino equivalent of the Grammy They have also been conferred the Tanglaw Ng Lahi Award the highest accolade given by Jesuits in the field of culture and arts

The APO also earned international recognition for Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo was recorded by 15 Filipino artists in April 1986 A few months later the English version A New and Better Way was launched in Australia In February 1987 the first anniversary of the Philippines People Power revolution the song was released in London England The lyrics of the song are embedded on a wall of Our Lady of Edsa Shrine the center of the revolution

In 1998 Legendary OPM group APO and defunct band Eraserheads teamed up for their first San Miguel Beer TV commercial Homeboys The concept of reviving and modernizing their originals by rockalternative bands in the 1990s paved the way to two tribute albums by various bands entitled Kami nAPO Muna in 2006 and Kami nAPO Muna Ulit in 2007

In 1999 APO was also a finalist at MetroPop Song Festival for their song finalist Dito Sa Kanto the song was composed by Noel Cabangon then Cabangon covered his version in 1999 then rerecorded again a duet with Parokya Ni Edgar vocalist Chito Miranda in 2013

In 2007 Jacee with the group was awarded as MYX Magna Award 2007 in the MYX Music Awards 2007 achieving the best of opm pop music and also has an achievements in music and recording in the OPM history

In 2009 APO was finally inducted to the Philippines Eastwood City Walk Of Fame contributing their skills in both singing hosting and acting

Just a few years after their hiatus the tribute album Kami nAPO Muna The Music Of APO Hiking Society was released in honor of the group The Filipino musical artists who did their own unique renditions of The APO classics includes Imago Orange and Lemons Parokya ni Edgar Kamikazee Sandwich Sugarfree Itchyworms Sponge Cola Boldstar Sound Drip Rocksteddy Top Suzara Barbie Almalbis Kitchie Nadal Shamrock and The Dawn Their second volume Kami nAPO muna Ulit has also included their new members in the compilation album are True Faith Silent Sanctuary Concrete Sam Up Dharma Down Chilitees The Bloomfields Scrambled Eggs The Spaceflower Show and Hilera

Acoustic Balladeer Noel Cabangon also had a new tribute album to the pinoy pop musical group Throwback Ang Songbook Ng APO was launched in 2014 with features with his cover versions of popular various APO songs in his new album released by Universal Records

On 20 September 2008 Apo Hiking Society had a reunion concert called Apo of the Philippines which was held at the Araneta Coliseum to celebrate their 39th Anniversary They sang all of the APO Favorites and all songs from their past releases

On February 7 2009 The Apo performed in the Open Air FTI Complex in Taguig The free concert was sponsored in cooperation with the Taguig City hall One month later the Eraserheads had their Final Set Concert

On November 17 2009 the Apo Hiking Society marked their 40th anniversary with a big concert at the SM North EDSA Skydome It was called APO KayangKaya Pa This was originally scheduled on September 26 but was rescheduled due to the Typhoon Ondoy Ketsana

Last December 16 2009 the APO Hiking Society announced that they are already retiring as a group due to diminishing creative process They performed a series of shows that started on February 14 2010 and ended on May just in time for the elections They also reunited for the last time to perform in the Inauguration of President Benigno Noynoy Aquino III last June 30 2010

The Blind Side Evolution of a Game
The Blind Side Evolution of a Game is a book by Michael Lewis released on September 2 2006 by W W Norton  Company It focuses on American football

The book features two dominant storylines The first is an examination of how offensive football strategy has evolved over the past three decades in large part due to linebacker Lawrence Taylors arrival in the 1980s and how this evolution has placed an increased importance on the role of the offensive left tackle Most quarterbacks are righthanded and in order to throw they stand with their left shoulders facing down field Thus they turn their backs to linebackers and other defenders pass rushing from the left side creating a vulnerable blind side that the left tackle must protect Taylors speed and power changed the role of outside linebacker to become a more attacking aggressive position This in turn caused teams to emphasize larger and more agile left tackles

The second storyline features Michael Oher the former left tackle for the Ole Miss football team and later right tackle for the Baltimore Ravens Lewis follows Oher from his impoverished upbringing through his years at Briarcrest Christian School his adoption by Sean Michael Lewiss former schoolmate and Leigh Anne Tuohy and on to his position as one of the most highly coveted prospects in college football

The film The Blind Side was directed by John Lee Hancock and primarily follows the story of Michael Oher It stars Quinton Aaron as Oher along with Sandra Bullock Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates It also features appearances by several past and present college football coaches playing themselves

Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast
DTMB Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast is the TV standard for mobile and fixed terminals used in the Mainland China Cuba Hong Kong and Macau

Previously known as DMBTH Digital Multimedia BroadcastTerrestrialHandheld the DTMB is a merger of the standards ADTBT developed by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University DMBT developed by Tsinghua University and TiMi Terrestrial Interactive Multiservice Infrastructure this last one is the standard proposed by the Academy of Broadcasting Science in 2002

At first neither Shanghai Jiao Tong University nor Tsinghua had enough political strength to make their own technology become the unique standard so the final decision was to opt for a double standard merged with the TIMI 3 standard responding to a need for backward compatibility

The DTMB was created in 2004 and finally became an official DTT standard in 2006

Main channel of province TV in each province



See China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting CMMB



Besides the basic functions of traditional television service the DTMB allows additional services using the new television broadcasting system DTMB system is compatible with fixed reception indoor and outdoor and mobile digital terrestrial television


The DTMB standard uses many advanced technologies to improve their performance for example a pseudorandom noise code PN as a guard interval that allows faster synchronization system and a more accurate channel estimation LowDensity Parity Check LDPC for error correction modulation Time Domain Synchronization  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing TDSOFDM which allows the combination of broadcasting in SD HD and multimedia services etc

This system gives flexibility to the services offered to support the combination of singlefrequency networks SFN and multifrequency networks MFN The different modes and parameters can be chosen depending on the type of service and networks environment

The sequence of pseudorandom pattern is defined in time domain and the information of the Discrete Fourier transform DFT is defined in the frequency domain The two frames are multiplexed in the time domain resulting in Time domain synchronization TDS

This transmission system makes the conversion of the input signal to the output data of terrestrial TV signal

The data passes through the encoder the error protection process FEC Forward Error Correction through the constellation mapping process and then the interleaving processes the information to create the data blocks The data block and the TPS information are multiplexed and pass through the data processor to form the body structure It combines information from the body and the head to form the frame and this is passed through the SRRC Square Root Raised Cosine filter to become a signal within an 8MHz channel bandwidth Finally the signal is modulated to put it in the corresponding frequency band

Kneller Hall
Kneller Hall is a mansion in Whitton in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames It houses the Royal Military School of Music training musicians for the British Army which acquired the building in the mid19th century It is also home to the schools Museum of Army Music The Army is scheduled to vacate the site in 2020

The first house on the site was built by Edmund Cooke between 1635 and 1646 and in 1664 was the fourth largest house in Twickenham

In 1709 the property was purchased by Sir Godfrey Kneller court painter to British monarchs from Charles II to George I He had the original house demolished and replaced by a new building reputedly designed by Sir Christopher Wren This second house was known as Whitton Hall after the village but was renamed by Knellers widow in memory of her husband In 1757 the house was sold to Sir Samuel Prime a prominent London lawyer who with his son of the same name extended it significantly and landscaped the grounds After Samuel Prime junior died in 1813 the hall was sold to Charles Calvert Whig MP for Southwark from 1812 to 1832 He further expanded the house to designs by Philip Hardwick adding drawing rooms at the east and west ends of the building Calvert died of cholera in 1832 and his widow inhabited until death about 1845 The house was then acquired by the government as a teacher training college but it needed substantial reconstruction

Around 1850 much of the Wren bulk of the house was dilapidated and so was demolished The Hardwick additions formed the wings of the new house the one still standing today designed by George Mair This third building on the site is stonecorniced casemented and constructed as to its ground floor central range and otherwise built of red bricks all in the neoJacobethan style suitable to 19th and 20th century mansions of its scale It consists of 17 bays the central of which is the widest and of stained glass and the two adjacent of which are arrowslit windows The bays are split into five recessed or projecting ranges Two square pavilion towers form the near left and right bays each tower crowned by a stone and leaded ogeeshaped cupola Its gatepiers and house are separately listed by Historic England in the initial grade II category

From 1850 to 1856 Kneller Hall served as a teacher training college under principal Frederick Temple and viceprincipal Francis Turner Palgrave known for his poetry anthology Palgraves Golden Treasury In exchange for a twoyear college education almost entirely subsidised by the state  one of the first forms of statesponsored social mobility  graduates of the college were supposed to teach pauper and delinquent boys in specially built district schools Though Kneller Hall itself was generously funded by the state the larger scheme to build district schools never came to fruition owing to political and religious conflict The college closed when it was unable to attract any more students who were now expected to teach in miserable conditions in Britains workhouses 

On 3 March 1857 the building was taken over by the War Office as the base for a school for army bandsmen it then evolved into the Royal Military School of Music During the Second World War the site was briefly the headquarters of the CommanderinChief Home Forces from late 1939 until the headquarters moved out to St Pauls School in July 1940

On 18 January 2016 defence minister Mark Lancaster announced that Kneller Hall was one of 12 Ministry of Defence MoD sites proposed to be released as part of the MoDs drive for greater efficiency In November 2016 the MoD announced that the site would close in 2020

Recycling in Canada
This article outlines the position and trends of recycling in Canada Since the 1980s most mid to large municipalities in most provinces have recycling programs As of 2012 Canada has a recycling rate around 268 

In 1981 Resource Integration Systems RIS in collaboration with Laidlaw International tested the first blue box recycling system on 1500 homes in Kitchener Ontario Due to the success of the project the City of Kitchener put out a contract for public bid in 1984 for a recycling system citywide Laidlaw won the bid and continued with the popular blue box recycling system Today hundreds of cities around the world use the blue box system or a similar variation

In Alberta the Alberta Recycling Management Authority also known as Alberta Recycling is an armslength body set up by the Government of Alberta under the Ministry of the Environment to coordinate recycling in the province It administers the surcharge that has been added to the price of electronics paint and tires sold in the province since 2005 to pay for the recycling of those products in Alberta and it helps to administer the provinces household hazardous waste disposal program

A separate management authority the Beverage Container Management Board BCMB is responsible for recycling of beverage containers Beverage container recycling regulations were first introduced provincewide in 1972 but the BCMB was created in 1997 to create a provincial oversight body for the industry The BCMB oversees two nonprofit corporations which process the materials the Alberta Beer Container Corporation ABCC for standardsized beer bottles which reuses rather than recycles the bottles and the Alberta Beverage Container Recycling Corporation ABCRC for all other beverage containers Containers are actually collected at privately owned forprofit bottle depots there are over 200 such bottle depots in Alberta which are members of the Alberta Bottle Depot Association

The Recycling Council of Alberta is a registered charity which has promoted recycling in Alberta since 1987 Specific industry groups lobby for their niche within the recycling sector such as the Alberta Plastics Recycling Association

Curbside recycling of newsprint cardboard plastic packaging and other nonfood household wastes is the responsibility of the individual municipalities of Alberta Most of Albertas most populous municipalities have blue box blue bag or blue bin recycling container programs The two largest municipalities however adopted wastediverting policies at a very different pace Edmonton began a pilot project in curbside recycling for singlefamily houses in 1986 and adopted it citywide in 1988 expanding over the years to include more items Christmas trees in 1990 and construction waste in 2008 and higher levels of processing including largescale composting and capturing methane to produce energy In addition the scope of collection has expanded to include multifamily buildings in 2001 and businesses in 2010 It is expected that when the wastetobiofuel plant is completed in 2012 Edmonton will divert 90 of its waste from landfills

By contrast Calgary conducted a pilot project on curbside recycling in 1991 and then abandoned curbside collection for a dropoff system until a second pilot program in 2004 and currently collects recyclates only at private houses with no plans to introduce collection at condo and apartment buildings before 2015

CP Tank
CP Tank or Cowasjee Patel Tank is a former water tank for supplying drinking water in Girgaon South Mumbai

Although long vanished the city of Bombay once had many water tanks within its city limits The tanks were once the only source of water to the city The tanks were named after philanthropic citizens who donated money to fund the building of these tanks so that the citizens of the city would get a fresh source of drinking water

The CP Tank was built by Cowasji Rustamjee Patel in 1776 The Framji Cowasji Tank bordered Esplanade was built by Framji Cowasji in 1831

All that remains of the tank is a plaque on a wall opposite Metro Cinema in Girgaon

Recycling in the United States
There is no national law in the United States that mandates recycling and state and local governments often introduce their own recycling requirements In 2014 the recyclingcomposting rate for municipal solid waste in the US was 346 A number of US states including California Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Iowa Maine Massachusetts Michigan New York Oregon and Vermont have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers while other jurisdictions rely on recycling goals or landfill bans of recyclable materials

On a national level the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA oversees a variety of waste issues These include regulation of hazardous wastes landfill regulations and setting recycling goals

More specific recycling legislation is localized through city or state governments State regulation falls into two major categories landfill bans and recycling goals Landfill bans make it illegal to dispose of enumerated items in a landfill Most often these items include yard waste oil and recyclables easily collected in curbside recycling programs States with landfill bans of recyclables include Wisconsin Minnesota Michigan and North Carolina Other states focus on recycling goals These include California and Illinois One ways in which some states encourage recycling of specific drink containers is through the passage of a bottle bill

A number of US states such as California Hawaii Oregon Connecticut Delaware Maine Vermont Massachusetts Iowa Michigan and New York have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers in order to promote reuse and recycling Most are five cents per can or bottle Michigans has maintained a 10 cent deposit value for bottles and cans since 1976

Some cities such as Seattle and states like Connecticut have created mandatory recycling laws that may fine citizens who throw away a certain percentage of recyclable materials in their garbage waste Vermont also employed a landfill ban of recyclable materials food and yard waste and wood There are also voluntary programs and educational programs to increase recycling where it is not mandated by law

Disposal of recyclables in the garbage is prohibited from households businesses and apartments For businesses that would include prohibiting the disposal of cardboard paper and yard waste in the garbage For apartments and houses disposal of glass paper cardboard aluminum and plastic in the garbage would be prohibited With businesses and apartments if garbage collectors find more than 10 percent of the container filled with recyclables they will leave a tag On the third tag the business or apartment tenants will receive a 50 fine However households do not face the risk of being fined If trash collectors find over 10 percent of their garbage contains recyclables they will leave a tag asking the household to separate the garbage and recyclables for collection the next week

In a 1996 article in The New York Times John Tierney claimed that government mandated recycling wastes more resources than it saves
Tierneys article received a referenced critique from the Environmental Defense Fund which noted that the article relied heavily on quotes and information supplied by a group of consultants and think tanks that have strong ideological objections to recycling or a vested financial
interest in opposing it

In 2003 Daniel K Benjamin a professor of economics at Clemson University published a paper through the Property and Environment Research Center that reiterated many of the points brought up in the New York Times article backing them up with a detailed inquiry into the recycling industry of the US In 2010 he followed up on that with an updated look into the recycling policies of the US finding that not much has changed

When the recycling industry was in its infancy in the United States the financial costs of collecting depositing and processing recyclables exceeded that of trash disposal Some opponents of recycling argued that state support for recycling may be more financially expensive in the short term than alternatives such as landfill disposal For example recycling efforts in New York City cost 57 million per year in 2002 and by 2015 it cost the city 300 more to recycle each ton of waste than to dump it in landfill To refute this argument people pointed out that the social benefits to society from recycling compensate for any difference in cost Landfilling waste is an inefficient use of resources contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere when unharvested or incompletely harvested and by the pollution of groundwater and waterways The long term financial and social costs of pollution caused by landfilling waste are often not taken into consideration

However in many regions of the country there are now an economic incentives to recycle As early as 2003 Fort Worth Texas was making 1000000 from their recycling program Similarly Waukesha Countys recycling program in Wisconsin began operating with positive revenues in 2004
Most recently Waukesha County began receiving a 650 per ton bonus for recyclables coming into their private MRF Materials Recycling Facility Combining that with the average revenue from the sale of the materials minus the longterm costs incurred if the items had been landfilled the average total lost revenue countys share for recyclables thrown in the landfill is 11250

Recycling statistics ca 2014


The New York Times reported in May 2018 that in somes cases 25 of all recyclables collected are sent to landfill

Recycling rates vary by material and product type


Electronic waste or ewaste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices Used electronics which are destined for reuse resale salvage recycling or disposal are also considered ewaste Informal processing of ewaste in developing countries can lead to adverse human health effects and environmental pollution

Electronic scrap components such as CPUs contain potentially harmful components such as lead cadmium beryllium or brominated flame retardants Recycling and disposal of ewaste may involve significant risk to workers and communities in developed countries and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from landfills and incinerator ashes

According to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA it is important to dispose of electronics via recycling becauseElectronic products are made from valuable resources and materials including metals plastics and glass all of which require energy to mine and manufacture Donating or recycling consumer electronics conserves our natural resources and avoids air and water pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by manufacturing virgin materials Consumer recycling options include donating equipment directly to organizations in need sending devices directly back to their original manufacturers or getting components to a convenient recycler or refurbisher

The Environmental Protection Agency reports 290 million scrap tires were generated in 2003 Of the 290 million 45 million of these scrap tires were used to make automotive and truck tire retreads In 2017 287 million were generated 38 million reused and 249 million scrapped With landfills minimizing their acceptance of whole tires and the health and environmental risks of stockpiling tires many new markets have been created for scrap tires Growing markets exist for a majority of scrap tires produced every year supported by state and local government Tires are also often recycled for use on basketball courts and new shoe products

Tires are not desired at landfills due to their large volumes and 75 void space which quickly consumes valuable space As of 2017 40 states banned whole tires from landfills 38 allowed shredded tires 24 allowed processed tires in monofills Fees are collected by 37 states

In 2017 814 of scrapped tires were marketed for some beneficial use down from 879 in 2015 Of the 3411 thousand tons of marketed scrap tires 508 were used as fuel 296 as ground rubber Of the tires used as fuel 46 were consumed in cement kilns 29 in pulp and paper mills and 25 in electric utility boilers

The United States has decreased the number of waste tires in storage from about 1 billion in 1992 down to 60 million tires in 2017 primarily due to state scrap management programs Most of the remaining stockpiles are in Colorado and Texas

US state laws and regulations dealing with scrap tires are currently enacted in 48 states Here are some common features of state programs that deal with scrap tires source of funding for the program licensing or registration of scrap tire haulers processors and end users manifests for scrap tire shipments limitations on who may handle scrap tires financial assurance requirements for scrap tire handlers and market development activities Some state programs are now supported by fees charged to the consumer at purchase or disposal of each tire These fees sometimes called tipping fees help to support recycling costs When the disposal rates charged to consumers are set high this in turn discourages landfill disposal a simple solution encouraging more affordable tire recycling programs

For most of the early 21st century China was the main destination for the worlds scrap material This resulted from a combination of factors including the growing need for metal paper and plastics in Chinas expanding industry lax environmental regulations cheap labor and inexpensive shipping using containers that would otherwise be returned to China empty In the United States this resulted in a strong market for many scrap commodities and allowed local recycling programs to come close to breaking even economically or even to turn a small profit That situation abruptly changed in 2017 when China announced its National Sword program which banned many scrap imports and imposed strict quality standards on others starting in February 2018 Acceptable limits for contamination in imported waste were cut from 510 percent to 05 percent Since then almost no plastic scrap has been exported to China from the United States and shipments of metal and paper scrap have been sharply reduced Scrap plastic imports dropped from 35 million metric tons in 2017 to 21300 metric tons in the first half of 2018 As a result scrap prices in the US have plummeted US recycling industry is responding by investing in better sorting equipment to attempt to meet the National Sword standards and by developing new market for waste materials both within the US and in other countries including Southeast Asia and India However several countries in Southeast Asia have announced their own restrictions on recycling

The first recorded mass recycling program in the United States Ban The Can was conceived and executed in 1970 by Ruth Pat Webb in Honolulu Hawaii Webb organized military and civilian volunteers to collect over 9 tons 8200kg of metal cans from the roadways and highways of Oahu The metal cans were later recycled into steel reinforcement bars to be used in local construction projects

The Stanolind Recycling Plant was in operation as early 1947 Another early recycling mill was Waste Techniques built in Conshohocken Pennsylvania in 1972 Waste Techniques was sold to Frank Keel in 1978 and resold to BFI in 1981 Woodbury New Jersey was the first city in the United States to mandate recycling Led by Donald Sanderson who was President of Woodbury City Council and Woodbury Recycling Committee in the early 1970s the idea of towing a recycling trailer behind a waste management vehicle to enable the collection of trash and recyclable material at the same time emerged Other towns and cities soon followed suit and today many cities in the United States make recycling a requirement

In 1987 the Mobro 4000 barge hauled garbage from New York to North Carolina where it was denied It was then sent to Belize where it was denied as well Finally the barge returned to New York and the garbage was incinerated The incident led to heated discussions in the media about waste disposal and recycling The incident is often referred to as igniting the recycling hysteria of the 1990s

Integrating recycling into K12 educational system has become a goal for many educators Usually it is integrated into science or social studies classrooms This is due to its inclusion in the national education standards for both of these subject areas Common areas that recycling is integrated into the curriculum include areas such as the study of natural resources general environmental units soil units water units community units economic units and geography units Although interest is growing major textbook publishers do not always include recycling in a textbook so teachers are left to supplement the textbooks with outside curriculum to meet the national standards For example in a unit about trees or natural resources teachers could include supplemental curriculum about recycling because in the textbook it is never explicitly covered Nonprofit organizations as well as governmental organizations have created supplemental curriculum for teachers to fill this void Some purely nonprofit groups include the Center for a New American Dream and Be SMART Other creators of curriculum include governmental offices Some of these include Oregon California and Waukesha County Wisconsin Also some nonprofit organizations have partnered with sections of the government to collaborate on educational materials For example the Keystone Center partnered with the United States Department of Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory to create curriculum on global warming

America Recycles Day ARD is the only nationally recognized day dedicated to encouraging Americans to recycle and buy recycled products ARD is celebrated annually on November 15 The World Recycling Day celebrated in most countries though falls on July 8 Thousands of events are held across the US to raise awareness about the importance of recycling and to encourage American to sign personal pledges to recycle and buy products made from recycled materials

Started by the recycling sector organization National Recycling Coalition in 1997 America Recycles Day has been a program of national nonprofit Keep America Beautiful since 2009 As the managing entity of America Recycles Day Keep America Beautiful provides promotional and marketing support and resources to a network of local event organizers It is sponsored by private and public entities and the EPA

Although America may not enjoy much of a reputation for environmentalism on the global stage in some US cities recycling levels are much higher than for example in the UK

Bute Shinty Club
Bute Shinty Club is a shinty club from Rothesay Isle of Bute Scotland It has a reserve team which is in South Division Two

The club has been reconstituted on several occasions since its formation in 1906 There was Bute Camanachd and North Bute Shinty Club North Bute competed in the first ever Sutherland Cup final in 1923 The club has existed in its present form since 1946

The club won the Sutherland Cup in 1972 and has won the reintroduced Balliemore Cup on four occasions notably in the first final in 1985 as well as in 2006 when they defeated a Beauly team who held home advantage 2006 was one of the clubs most successful seasons of all time winning South Division One thus gaining promotion to the Premier Division winning the Balliemore Cup and reaching the final of the Celtic Society Cup

In 2008 after several years as a one team club Bute restarted their second team which finished fifth in South Division Two in their first season

The club reached the semifinals of the Camanachd Cup for the first time in 2008

In 2009 they were the last club to finish their season on 12 December 2009 They eventually survived relegation overhauling Lochaber Camanachd with a win against Oban Camanachd

2010 saw Butes period in the Premier Division come to an end with a loss against Oban Camanachd who had been behind the whole season until that last game

Bute romped back into the Premier Division in 2011 with a stunning 100 record in the league as well as winning the Balliemore Cup Bute were relegated in 2012 from a very competitive Premiership

The clubs top player during this successful period has been Hector Whitelaw a full international and a powerful player capable of playing both upfront and at the back He is a prolific goalscorer

The club was one of the main opponents of the national league setup due to the difficulty of traveling to away games in places such as Cannich and Portree Until the establishment of Lewis Camanachd they were the only senior team in Scotland with no fixed link to the mainland

The stepping back of Whitelaw to the second team and the loss of the Zavaroni brothers to Kyles Athletic saw Bute take a step back but they still made good showings in the cups and also made it into the National Division One setup for 2014 with a secondplace finish in Division South One

Several other player changes in 2014 led to a disastrous showing in National Division One even conceding a game at one point Bute finished rock bottom and were due for relegation to South Division One but were given a reprieve due to league reconstruction However Bute elected to be relegated to South Division One feeling that National Division shinty was not feasible for the club at that time In January 2015 former referee Ted McDonald became their senior team coach

<doc id="7709166" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709166" title="Nostos">
Nostos
Nostos Ancient Greek  is a theme used in Ancient Greek literature which includes an epic hero returning home by sea In Ancient Greek society it was deemed a high level of heroism or greatness for those who managed to return This journey is usually very extensive and includes being shipwrecked in an unknown location and going through certain trials that test the hero The return isnt just about returning home physically but also about retaining certain statuses and retaining your identity upon arrival The theme of Nostos is brought to life in Homers The Odyssey where the main hero Odysseus tries to return home after battling in the Trojan War Odysseus is challenged by many temptations such as the Sirens and the Lotuseaters If Odysseus had given into these temptations it would have meant certain death and thus failing to return home Nostos is used today in many forms of literature and movies

In the Odyssey Homer has nostos being the return home from Troy by sea Nostos can be told by those who experienced it themselves or there are simply instances in which it is present Those who told their adventures on the sea on their journey back home from Troy were Menelaus Nestor and Odysseus Those three recount their adventures to others in the epic With Menelaus in Book Four he tells of his time in Egypt and other irregular stops He did not stop at just his nostos but he told of Agamemnons fatal nostos in great detail as well as a small section of Odysseus journey Nestor gives more on Menelaus nostos and his journey home with Odysseus and Menelaus In Book Three Nestor said we pondered our long seavoyage whether we should sail over the top of rocky Chios by the island Psyros keeping it on our left hand or else to pass under Chios by windy Mimas We asked the god to give us some portent for a sign and the god gave us one and told us to cut across the middle main sea for Euboia and so most quickly escape the hovering evil Here Nestor made it evident to the audience that his and Diomedes journey home was a perfect nostos they had no real issues which was quite different from Agamemnons This great difference shows how different each heros journey home could be In these instances where nostos is simply present and not told by the individual in The Odyssey there is an intention to reach a specific destination and some other force blowing the characters off course and arrive in unexpected places on their journey to their homeThe Odyssey had several different instances of nostos One specific instance where Odysseus companions lost their nostos was when they ate Helios cattle and were killed for this since they were specifically told not to Odysseus warned the men when he said Friends since there is food and drink stored in the fast ship let us then keep our hands off the cattle for fear that something may befall us These are the cattle and fat sheep of a dreaded god Helios who sees all things and listens to all things At that point Odysseus warns the men of what will happen if they eat the cattle yet they do anyway This situation took away their nostos because their journey home came to an end

Not all Greek heroes experience nostos Achilles nostos is unique in The Iliad this is because he knows himself that he will not have a nostos creating a greater difference between him and the other heroes such as Odysseus Achilles knows that he has two options when it comes to the Trojan War  he can either die in the battle with glory and have a short life or not participate and live a long yet insignificant life In the ninth book he says my nostos has perished but my kleos will be unwilting In this instance he has chosen the route of glory and says he will not now return home because it is destined that he will die in battle

Odysseus was able to tell his own story of his nostos since he has survived Odysseus was able to tell part of his nostos to the Phaeacians and the length of his journey shows how difficult it can be to achieve nostos This arrival and telling of his tales is a big deal though he has not reached home it is a huge mile marker After Odysseus and his companions leave Circes palace safely his crew members show their happiness by saying we rejoice for you saved yourself nourished by Zeus as much as if we had reached Ithaca which shows the comparison of escaping to returning home

Nostos meant several different things in this epic it meant escaping death safe landings returning home from war and being back home All of those come through because as the hero returned from war the idea of escaping death from war remained in their forethought These meanings all resemble nostos and when heroes are on their journey back they will have the ultimate Kleos once they have arrived and that is celebrated

The word nostalgia was first coined as a medical term in 1688 by Johannes Hofer 16691752 a Swiss medical student It uses the word  along with another Greek root  or algos meaning pain to describe the psychological condition of longing for the past 
In James Joyces Ulysses the final part episodes 1618 during which Leopold Bloom returns home is called the Nostos

Another depiction of nostos in contemporary media would be the example of the movie Hercules Unchained which was released in 1959 This movie was similar to the Odyssey Hercules journey was very similar to Odysseus One specific instance being when Hercules returned home with Iole whom he won in an archery contest which is similar to Odysseus contest to save his marriage He was accidentally poisoned by his wife and asked to have his body set on fire Having his body set on fire is what led to his many heroic achievements

During that time period there were no other films like this one that depicted this type of ancient material Hercules nostos had him die and then be reborn this is to rediscover his identity within himself and the community This is similar to Odysseus because he transforms personally from a war machine to a family man

The TV series  in which the titular spacecraft is stranded 70000 lightyears from Earth and encounters numerous hostile and friendly aliens and strange phenomena on its way home has been described by classicists as a nostos

Anglique instrument
The anglique French from Italian angelica is a plucked string instrument of the lute family of the baroque era It combines features of the lute the harp and the theorbo

It shares the form of its pear shaped body as well as its vibrating string length of 54 to 70cm with the lute Differing from the lute the 16 string angelica was singlestrung like a theorbo with which it shares its extended neck with a second peg box bearing six bass strings

The angelica was tuned diatonically like a harp C  E  F  G  A  B  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e That range is the same as that of the French or lesser theorbo but the latter differs in that its tuning is reentrant C  D  E  F  G  A  B  c  d  g  c  e a  d The diatonic tuning limited its compass but produced a full and clear tone by the increased use of open strings

Little surviving music for the angelica as well as few surviving instruments indicate that the angelica flourished during the second half of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries

Some authors claim that the angelica was invented in England But that claim is based on the misinterpretation of its name M H Fuhrmann Musicalischer Trichter FrankfurtSpree 1706 p 91 James Talbot correctly interpreted angelica as angel lute because of its lovely sound ms Oxford 532 16851701 

Music for the angelica is notated in French tablature with the designation of bass courses varying according to respective authors 

The Ukrainian Torban is a descendant of the Anglique

After the breakup of the Soviet Union there were two time zones in Uzbekistan In the Soviet era most time zones were daylight time in the winter and double daylight time in the summer The western part of the country observed Samarkand Time 5 or 6 hours ahead of UTC The eastern part observed Tashkent Time 6 or 7 hours ahead of UTC In 1991 the clocks did not move forward in the spring to maintain single daylight time only in the summer That fall a unified time zone was adopted 5 hours ahead of UTC

Excitation filter
An excitation filter is a high quality opticalglass filter commonly used in fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopic applications for selection of the excitation wavelength of light from a light source Most excitation filters select light of relatively short wavelengths from an excitation light source as only those wavelengths would carry enough energy to cause the object the microscope is examining to fluoresce sufficiently The excitation filters used may come in two main types  short pass filters and band pass filters Variations of these filters exist in the form of notch filters or deep blocking filters commonly employed as emission filters Other forms of excitation filters include the use of monochromators wedge prisms coupled with a narrow slit for selection of the excitation light and the use of holographic diffraction gratings etc for beam diffraction of white laser light into the required excitation wavelength selected for by a narrow slit

An excitation filter is commonly packaged with an emission filter and a dichroic beam splitter in a cube so that the group is inserted together into the microscope The dichroic beam splitter controls which wavelengths of light go to their respective filter

Posterity of Heaven
Posterity of Heaven or Cheonson   designates the Korean people because they are considered the descendants of Heaven or the heavenly god Based on historical records the ancient Koreans generally worshiped the heavens and the sun liked brightness and considered their states governed by Heaven

Because the thought about the Posterity of Heaven an archaic word says that the peoples mind is equal to the Heavens mind which warns rulers of the significance of the people The Korean national anthem Aegukga supports this concept The lyrics of Aegukga say May our nation be eternal by the protection and help of Heaven In addition the National Foundation Day Gaecheonjeol literally means the day when the sky was opened It is natural that the sky should be opened for the Posterity of Heaven to found a nation

In very ancient times there were a divine regent who had supervised and taught the people as a representative of the Heavenly God These divine regents were called Hwanin Hwanung and Dangun based on the period


Korean kingdoms had used both titles of kings and emperors as the title of rulers because they thought that the highest rulers was Heaven and all rulers must be a representative of Heaven This concept of the Posterity of Heaven is somewhat different from the Chinese concept of the Son of Heaven It is believed that the Chinese emperor governs the Chinese as the son of Heaven But the Koreans believe that they themselves are the descendants of Heaven the Heavenly God governs them by himself and a ruler of a nation is nothing but the supervisor as a representative of Heaven

Because of the Koreans thought about Heavenly offspring they have had an anniversary sacrifice month is as lunar calendar Scholars say that dolmen in Manchuria and Korean Peninsula was an altar to sacrifice to Heaven

Michael Agerskov
Michael Agerskov 18701933 was a Danish spiritualist teacher and author best known for his book Toward the Light which he coauthored with his wife Johanne Agerskov Agerskovs literary production includes poems novels and also schoolbooks for the primary school and the secondary school in Denmark Together with Erling Rrdam he also wrote a reader published several times during 1904 and 1933 and also translated into Swedish

In the first decade of the last century Michael Agerskov became interested in spiritistic phenomena and participated in spiritistic sances together with his wife and he also produced several poems by the means of what was called automatic writing the hand writing down the thoughts of a discarnated spirit Many of these poems were made public It soon became obvious that Johanne Agerskov was an intermediary and they formed a circle together with two other couples and held sances because they were told that they before their incarnation had promised to take on the task of being the instrumental to bring to mankind some truths from the transcendental world Johanne Agerskov had the unique ability to close off her own thoughts and to intuitively receive the thoughts of the spirits that contacted her The other participants were called on to form questions on which the spirits gave the answers which were then written down This work continued for several years and resulted in the publishing of the ethicreligious philosophic and scientific book Toward the Light and to several other books concerning the same issues 

Michael Agerskov was the publisher of all the books along with his work as a teacher censor and author of his own literary works Toward the Light was distributed to all the bishops and to 60 ministers of the Danish church and the Agerskovs hope and intention was the Danish church to go through a reformation on the basis of the information given in Toward the Light with the participation of the bishops and the ministers But even though Toward the Light had many followers among the common people the church did not react and the book did not lead to a public interest to any extent 

Even though Michael and Johanne Agerskov had participated in spiritistic sances they soon urged the spiritists to end their activities In Toward the Light there is very clearly stated that the spirits of the dead human beings are not allowed to visit the earth because they need to rest and to prepare for their next incarnation Only if we are called upon by the spirits of the light we should react to their calling

After many requests Michael Agerskov in 1922 wrote the story about the extraordinary events that had led to the publishing of Toward the Light in the book Some Psychic Experiences

In 1928 Michael Agerskov had a serious attack of influenza and as a repercussion of the illness he developed a serious condition of increasing paralysis of the muscles and he had to end his work as a teacher In 1932 he was so weak that he could not cross the floor of their living room by his own means and soon after the condition also involved the heart muscle He died in 1933

Johanne Agerskov
Johanne Elisabeth Agerskov 18731946 was a Danish medium Together with her husband Michael Agerskov she was responsible for the ethicoreligious philosophical and pseudoscientific book Toward the Light in Danish Vandrer mod Lyset first published by Michael Agerskov in Copenhagen in 1920

She was a daughter of a Dutch inventor minister and principal of the Royal Institute for DeafMutes in Copenhagen Rasmus MallingHansen  1835  1890 

In her younger days Johanne Agerskov worked as a teacher and she married Michael Agerskov in 1899 Their only daughter Inger Agerskov was born in 1900 and Johanne became a housewife 

During the first decade of the twentieth century Michael became interested in spiritual phenomena and persuaded his wife to participate in sances even though she was skeptical in the beginning Soon Johanne came to believe that the spirits of the transcendental world had called upon her and had given her the message that she was a medium and that before her birth she had promised to be instrumental in bringing eternal truths to mankind

Convinced that she had a special mission Agerskov and her husband formed a circle with two more couples and for many years held weekly sances in which they believed messages from the spirits of the light were given to Agerskov through intuitive thoughtinspiration She claimed a unique ability to close off her own thoughts so that all she could hear in her mind according to her was the thoughts of the spirit with whom she was supposed to be in contact That was very demanding and in that period she gave up all the pleasures of social life in order to be focused and prepared for the sances The members of the circle would submit questions for her to ask the spirits and shortly she would give them answers supposedly from the spirits which the other participants would write down

That resulted in the publication of the book Toward the Light which Agerskov called a message to mankind from the transcendental world and which she and her husband sent out to all the bishops and sixty ministers of the Danish national church Their hope was that these would participate in a reformation of the Danish church based upon the new knowledge given in Toward the Light The Agerskovs made great efforts to that end through correspondence and by opening their home to anybody who wanted to see them about Toward the Light but there was little public interest in the book and the expected reformation did not take place

Johanne Agerskov was also deeply engaged in the work of her father In 1924 a Danish professor asserted that MallingHansen was not the inventor of the Hansen Writing Ball and Agerskov undertook a thorough investigation of the facts together with her sister Engelke Wiberg They wrote several articles on the subject and Agerskov also wrote a book called Hvem var Skrivekuglens Opfinder Who was the Inventor of the Writing Ball published in Copenhagen in 1925

In 1926 a Society for the Advancement of Toward the Light was formed  which offered religious services for its members based on Toward the Light Agerskov was skeptical however because Toward the Light calls on believers to remain in the established church and to work for reformation from within

Even though the Agerskovs in the beginning had participated in spiritualist sances they soon asked their followers to end that activity because as they asserted in Toward the Light calling on the spirits of deceased ancestors would bring problems to those who could not resist the call to appear The spirits they said needed to rest and to prepare for their next incarnation and were not allowed to visit the earth

Michael Agerskov died in 1933 but Johanne continued to answer letters and to publish up until 1938 in collaboration with their daughter During the last years of her life Johanne Agerskov suffered from illness and was not able to leave her home

There has been controversy among Agerskovs followers over whether or not to publish photos of her as she said to destroy all her own pictures of herself before she died Some of the followers of Toward the Light contend that her will in this matter should be respected and oppose the publication of such pictures

Others see nothing wrong with publishing photos of her considering that photos of her are available in public collections in both Denmark and Norway and on the WorldWide Web This article contains photos of both Agerskov and her husband supplied by their descendants who have no objection to their publication

In architecture and masonry the term setoff is given to the horizontal line shown on a floorplan indicating a reduced wall thickness and consequently the part of the thicker portion appears projecting before the thinner In plinths this is generally simply chamfered In other parts of stonework the setoff is generally concealed by a projecting stringer Where as in parapets the upper part projects is proud of the lower the break is generally hid by a corbel watertable The portions of buttress caps which recede one behind another are also called setsoff

<doc id="7709451" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709451" title="Setoff law">
Setoff law
In law setoff or netting are legal techniques applied between persons with mutual rights and liabilities replacing gross positions with net positions It permits the rights to be used to discharge the liabilities where cross claims exist between a plaintiff and a respondent The result being that the gross claims of mutual debt produces a single net claim The net claim is known as a net position In other words a setoff is the right of a debtor to balance mutual debts with a creditor In bookkeeping terms setoffs are also known as reconciliations To determine a setoff simply subtract the smaller debt from the larger 

Any balance remaining due either of the parties is still owed but the remainder of the mutual debts has been set off The power of net positions is to reduce credit exposure also holding regulatory capital requirement and settlement advantages which contributes to market stability In regard to the financial market net positions are vital

Whilst netting and set off are often used interchangeably the legal distinction is made between netting which describes the procedure for and outcome of implementing a set off By contrast set off describes the legal bases for producing net positions Netting describes the form such as novation netting or closeout netting whilst set off describes judicially recognised grounds such as independent set off or insolvency set off Therefore a netting or setting off gross positions involves the use of offsetting positions with the same counterparty to address counterparty credit risk This is to be differentiated from hedging which uses offsetting positions with multiple parties to mitigate risk

The law does not permit counterparties to use third party debt to set off against an unrelated liability All forms of set off requires mutuality between claim and cross claim This protects property rights both inside insolvency and out primarily by ensuring that a nonowner cannot benefit from insolvency

The primary objective of netting is to reduce systemic risk by lowering the number of claims and cross claims which may arise from multiple transactions between the same parties This prevents credit risk exposure and prevents liquidators or other insolvency officers from cherrypicking transactions which may be profitable for the insolvent company 

At least three principle forms of netting may be distinguished in the financial markets Each is heavily relied upon to manage financial market specifically credit risk

Also called rolling netting netting by novation involves amending contracts by the agreement of the parties This extinguishes the previous claims and replaces them with new claims

This differs from settlement netting outlined below because the fusion of both claims into one producing a single balance occurs immediately at the conclusion of each subsequent contract This method of netting is crucial in financial settings particularly derivatives transactions as it avoids cherrypicking in insolvency The effectiveness of preinsolvency novation netting in an insolvency was discussed in British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France1975 1 WLR 758 Similar to settlement netting novation netting is only possible if the obligations have the same settlement date This means that if in the above example transaction2 was to be paid on Friday the two transactions would not offset Novation netting further cannot consolidate obligations This is a systems intensive process requiring tracking of obligations as they become due

An effective closeout netting scheme is said to be crucial for an efficient financial market Close out netting differs from novation netting in that it extends to all outstanding obligations of the party under a master agreement similar to the one used by ISDA These traditionally only operate upon an event of default of insolvency In the event of counterparty bankruptcy or any other relevant event of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated ie effected all transactions or all of a given type are netted ie set off against each other at market value or if otherwise specified in the contract or if it is not possible to obtain a market value at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the nondefaulting party in replacing the relevant contract The alternative would allow the liquidator to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to and thus potentially cherry pick There are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested
The key elements of close out netting are
Similar methods of close out netting exist to provide standardised agreements in market trading relating to derivatives and security lending such asrepos forwards or options The effect is that the netting avoids valuation of future and contingent debt by an insolvency officer and prevents insolvency officers from disclaiming executory contract obligations as is allowed within certain jurisdictions such as the US and UK The mitigated systemic risk which is induced by a close out scheme is protected legislatively Other systemic challenges to netting such as regulatory capital recognition under Basel II and other Insolvencyrelated matters seen in the Lamfalussy Report has been resolved largely through trade association lobbying for law reform In England  Wales the effect of British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France has largely been negated by Part VII of the Company Act 1989 which allows netting in situations which are in relation to money market contracts In regard to the BASEL Accords the first set of guidelines BASEL I was missing guidelines on netting BASEL II introduced netting guidelines

For cash settled trades this can be applied either bilaterally or multilaterally and on related or unrelated transactions
Obligations are not modified under settlement netting which relates only to the manner in which obligations are discharged Unlike closeout netting settlement netting is only possible in relation to likeobligations having the same settlement date These dates must fall due on the same day and be in the same currency but can be agreed in advance Claims exist but are extinguished when paid To achieve simultaneously payment only the act of payment extinguishes the claim on both sides This has the disadvantage that through the life of the netting the debts are outstanding and netting will likely not occur the effect of this on insolvency was seen in the above mentioned British Eagle These are routinely included within derivative transactions as they reduce the number and volume of payments and deliveries that take place but crucially does not reduce the presettlement exposure amount 

Set off is a legal event and therefore legal basis is required for the proposition of when two or more gross claims are netted Of these legal bases a common form is the legal defense of setoff which was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person Party A who owed money to another Party B could be sent to debtors prison despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court This operated as an equitable shield but not a sword Upon judgment both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing eg If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105 the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A Setoff can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that where a party defaults the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished

In certain jurisdictions including the UK certain types of setoff takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company This means that for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company mutual debts are setoff against each other and then either the bankrupts creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid depending on which side owed the most The primary argument This has been criticized as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu The alternative where a creditor has to pay all its debts but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get poses the danger of knockon insolvencies and thus a systemic market risk Seven still three core reasons underpin and justify the use of setoff First the law should uphold preinsolvency autonomy and setoffs as parties invariably rely on the preinsolvency commitments This is a core policy point Second as a matter of fairness and efficiency both outside and inside insolvency reduces negotiation and enforcement costs Third managing risk particularly systemic risk is crucially Clearing house rules offer stipulation that relationships with buyer and sellers are replaced by two relationships between buyer and clearing house and seller and clearing out Effect is automatic novation meaning all elements are internalised in current accounts Can be in different currencies as long as they are converted at calculation 

The right to set off is particularly important when a banks exposures are reported to regulatory authorities as is the case in the EU under financial collateral requirements If a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower and so is exposed because of the risk that the borrower might default thereby leading to the loss of the money of the bank or its depositors is thus replaced The bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower with an exposure of the money lent less the value of the security taken

Two primary examples of setoff rules are outlined below These are in addition to the financial regulations pertaining to netting set out by trade associations and the European Union through the Financial Collateral Directives 

Under English law there are broadly five types of setoff which have been recognised

The five types of set off are extremely important as a matter of efficiency and of mitigating risk Contractual set offs recognised as an incident of party autonomy whereas banker right of combination is considered a fundamental implied term It is an essential aspect for crossclaims especially when there exits overlapping obligations Common features of setoff are that they are confined to situations where claim and cross claim are for money or reducible to money and it requires mutuality

See De Magno v United States 636 F2d 714 727 DC Cir 1980 district court had jurisdiction over claim involving VAs affirmative 
action against an individual whether by bringing an action to recover on an asserted claim or by proceeding on its commonlaw right of setoff discussing similar language of predecessor statute 38 USC  211

See eg United States v Munsey Trust Co 332 US 234 239 67 SCt 1599 1601 91 LEd 2022 1947 government has the same right which belongs to every creditor to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor in his hands in extinguishment of the debts due to him  quoting Gratiot v United States 40 US 15 Pet 336 370 10 LEd 759 1841 see also Tatelbaum v United States 10 ClCt 207 210 1986 setoff right is inherent in the United States government and grounded on common law right of every creditor to set off debts

        Die integrated circuit
        A die in the context of integrated circuits is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated Typically integrated circuits are produced in large batches on a single wafer of electronicgrade silicon EGS or other semiconductor such as GaAs through processes such as photolithography The wafer is cut diced into many pieces each containing one copy of the circuit Each of these pieces is called a die

        There are three commonly used plural forms dice dies and die To simplify handling and integration onto a printed circuit board most dice are packaged in various forms

        Most dies are composed of silicon and used for integrated circuits The process begins with the production of monocrystalline silicon ingots These ingots are then sliced into disks with a diameter of up to 300mm These wafers are then polished to a mirror finish before going through photolithography In many steps the transistors are manufactured and connected with metal interconnect layers These prepared wafers then go through wafer testing to test their functionality The wafers are then sliced and sorted to filter out the faulty dies Functional dies are then packaged and the completed integrated circuit is ready to be shipped

        A die can host many types of circuits One common use case of an integrated circuit die is in the form of a Central Processing Unit CPU Through advances in modern technology the size of the transistor within the die has shrunk exponentially following Moores Law Other uses for dies can range from LED lighting to power semiconductor devices

        Cyclic ADPribose
        Cyclic ADP Ribose frequently abbreviated as cADPR is a cyclic adenine nucleotide like cAMP with two phosphate groups present on 5 OH of the adenosine like ADP further connected to another ribose at the 5 position which in turn closes the cycle by glycosidic bonding to the nitrogen 1 N of the same adenine base whose position N has the glycosidic bond to the other ribose The Nglycosidic bond to adenine is what distinguishes cADPR from ADPribose ADPR the noncyclic analog cADPR is produced from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD by ADPribosyl cyclases  as part of a second messenger system

        cADPR is a cellular messenger for calcium signaling It stimulates calciuminduced calcium release at lower cytosolic concentrations of Ca Primary target of cADPR is the ER Ca2 uptake mechanism Potentiation of Ca2 release by cADPR is mediated by increased accumulation of Ca2 in the SR

        cADPR and ADPR are synthesized from NAD by the bifunctional ectoenzymes of the CD38 family also includes the GPIanchored CD157 and the specific monofunctional ADP ribosyl cyclase of the mollusc Aplysia The same enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing cADPR to ADPR Catalysis proceeds via a covalently bound intermediate The hydrolysis reaction is inhibited by ATP and cADPR may accumulate Synthesis and degradation of cADPR by enzymes of the CD38 family involve respectively the formation and the hydrolysis of the Nglycosidic bond In 2009 the first enzyme able to hydrolyze the phosphoanhydride linkage of cADPR ie the one between the two phosphate groups has been reported

        Mill Bluff State Park
        Mill Bluff State Park is a state park in westcentral Wisconsin United States It is located in eastern Monroe and western Juneau counties near the village of Camp Douglas A unit of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve the park protects several prominent sandstone bluffs to high that formed as sea stacks 12000 years ago in Glacial Lake Wisconsin As a result these bluffs are steep and angular dissimilar to the rounded terrain more typical of the eastern half of the United States The bluffs served as landmarks to both early pioneers and travelers today on Interstate 9094 which passes through the park

        There are ten named bluffs in the park Mill Bluff high is between the interstate and US Route 12 The park office is at its foot and the campground is just to the west Bee Bluff although smaller and only high is the most visible bluff from the interstate as it stands adjacent to the westbound lanes To the north is Camels Bluff two separate outcroppings that together resemble the humps of a camel Nearby are Devils Monument and a high pinnacle called Cleopatras Needle The other less accessible bluffs are Round Bluff and Sugar Bowl Bluff to the south Wildcat Bluff and Bear Bluff to the north and Long Bluff to the northeast Also in the northeast is Ragged Rock an tall former bluff whose protective cap was worn away and is eroding into a conical mound

        The bluffs in the park and others nearby are formed of Late Cambrian sandstone Stratigraphically the stone of the bluffs is part of the Galesville Member of the Dresbach Group Sandstone from the Ironton Member of the Franconia Formation which is more solidly concreted tops each bluff This capping layer helped protect the softer stone below it from erosion Similar structures elsewhere in Wisconsin would have been bulldozed away by glaciers but these bluffs lie in the Driftless Area that part of the American Midwest which was never glaciated The bluffs are all outliers of the Franconia Cuesta to the south

        During the last ice age a tongue of ice dammed the Wisconsin River causing the water to back up into Glacial Lake Wisconsin It is estimated that the lake was about deep in this area so the taller bluffs became islands while the shorter ones would have been entirely underwater For the 3000 years of the lakes existence waves eroded the edges of the bluffs giving them their distinctive steep sides Thus in a geological sense the bluffs are sea stacks because they formed in a body of water In practice the larger formations are described as mesas the mediumsized ones as buttes and the smallest as a pinnacle

        The flat ground in the park consists of finely sorted sediments that settled to the bottom of Glacial Lake Wisconsin Glacial erratics have been found on the former lakebed which are explained as rocks which were embedded in icebergs that melted as they were floating in the lake

        The park is mostly forested with northern pin oak jack pine red pine eastern white pine and white oak dominant

        Several of the bluffs bear 400yearold petroglyphs shaped like bird tracks contemporaneous with the RocheaCri Petroglyphs in RocheaCri State Park

        The diaries and journals of westbound settlers often mention these bluffs A sawmill was operated in the vicinity after which Mill Bluff was named

        Mill Bluff and a small area at its foot was proclaimed a state park on August 13 1936 Mill Bluff State Park was added to the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve in May 1971 The parks boundaries were expanded to include the other bluffs later In 2002 a portion of the park containing all of the major bluffs received a further level of protection as Mill Bluff State Natural Area

        Mill Bluff State Park is open from May to September Small game hunting is permitted in sections of the park from November 1 to December 15 and deer hunting during a shorter period

        The parks small campground has 21 sites 6 with electrical hookups Amenities are primitive with pit toilets and no showers Potable water is available from hand pumps

        Swimming is available in a springfed lake south of the campground Sand has been added to make a beach

        A nature trail circles the base of Mill Bluff 223 stone steps built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s lead to its top north on County Road W Funnel Road is a pullout for the Camels Bluff loop trail which passes between the two sections of Camels Bluff and leads past the base of Devils Monument and Cleopatras Needle

        Because the bluffs are formed of soft sandstone and geologically unique all climbing is prohibited

    <doc id="7736733" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7736733" title="Seismic source">
        Seismic source
        A seismic source is a device that generates controlled seismic energy used to perform both reflection and refraction seismic surveys A seismic source can be simple such as dynamite or it can use more sophisticated technology such as a specialized air gun Seismic sources can provide single pulses or continuous sweeps of energy generating seismic waves which travel through a medium such as water or layers of rocks Some of the waves then reflect and refract and are recorded by receivers such as geophones or hydrophones

        Seismic sources may be used to investigate shallow subsoil structure for engineering site characterization or to study deeper structures either in the search for petroleum and mineral deposits or to map subsurface faults or for other scientific investigations The returning signals from the sources are detected by seismic sensors geophones or hydrophones in known locations relative to the position of the source The recorded signals are then subjected to specialist processing and interpretation to yield comprehensible information about the subsurface

        A seismic source signal has the following characteristics
        The generalized equation that shows all above properties is
        where formula2 is the maximum frequency component of the generated waveform

        The most basic seismic source is a sledge hammer either striking the ground directly or more commonly striking a metal plate on the ground known as hammer and plate Useful for seismic refraction surveys down to about 20 m below surface

        Explosives most widely used as seismic sources are knows as gelatin dynamites These dynamites are placed into three subcategories straight gelatins in which nitroglycerin also known as glyceryl trinitrate with the chemical formula C3H5ONO23 is the active component ammonia gelatins in which ammonia nitrite with chemical formula NHNO as the active component and semi gelatins in which the composition consists mostly of nitroglycerin

        Upon detonation explosives release large volumes of expanding gas very quickly forcing great pressure to the surroundings in the form of seismic waves

        Using explosives as seismic sources has been in practice for decades because of the reliability and energy efficiency they provide Such sources are most commonly used on land and swampy environments because of high thickness in sedimentsTypical charge sizes used in the field for reflection surveys are 025kg to 100kg for single hole sources 025kg to 250kg or more for multiple hole sources and may reach 2500kg or more for refraction surveys

        Though dynamites and other explosives are efficient seismic sources because of their reduced costs ease of transport in difficult terrains and lack of regular maintenance compared to other sourcesthe use of explosives is becoming restricted in certain areas causing decline and increasing popularity for alternative seismic sources

        For instance hexanitrostilbene was the main explosive fill in the thumper mortar round canisters used as part of the Apollo Lunar Active Seismic Experiments Generally the explosive charges are placed between below ground in a hole that is drilled with dedicated drilling equipment for this purpose This type of seismic drilling is often referred to as Shot Hole Drilling A common drill rig used for Shot Hole Drilling is the ARDCO C1000 drill mounted on an ARDCO K 4X4 buggy These drill rigs often use water or air to assist the drilling

        An air gun is used for marine reflection and refraction surveys It consists of one or more pneumatic chambers that are pressurized with compressed air at pressures from 14 to 21 MPa 2000 to 3000 lbfin Air guns are submerged below the water surface and towed behind a ship When an air gun is fired a solenoid is triggered which releases air into a fire chamber which in turn causes a piston to move thereby allowing the air to escape the main chamber and producing a pulse of acoustic energy Air gun arrays may consist of up to 48 individual air guns with different size chambers fired in concert the aim being to create the optimum initial shock wave followed by the minimum reverberation of the air bubbles

        Air guns are made from the highest grades of corrosion resistant stainless steel Large chambers ie greater than 1L or 70cuin tend to give low frequency signals and the small chambers less than 1 L give higher frequency signals

        A plasma sound source PSS otherwise called a spark gap sound source or simply a sparker is a means of making a very low frequency sonar pulse underwater For each firing electric charge is stored in a large highvoltage bank of capacitors and then released in an arc across electrodes in the water The underwater spark discharge produces a highpressure plasma and vapor bubble which expands and collapses making a loud sound Most of the sound produced is between 20 and 200Hz useful for both seismic and sonar applications

        There are also plans to use PSS as a nonlethal weapon against submerged divers

        In 1953 the weight dropping thumper technique was introduced as an alternative to dynamite sources
        A thumper truck or weightdrop truck is a vehiclemounted ground impact system which can be used to provide a seismic source A heavy weight is raised by a hoist at the back of the truck and dropped generally about three meters to impact or thump the ground To augment the signal the weight may be dropped more than once at the same spot the signal may also be increased by thumping at several nearby places in an array whose dimensions may be chosen to enhance the seismic signal by spatial filtering

        More advanced thumpers use a technology called Accelerated Weight Drop AWD where a high pressure gas min 7 MPa 1000 lbfin is used to accelerate a heavy weight hammer  to hit a base plate coupled to the ground from a distance of  Several thumps are stacked to enhance signal to noise ratio AWD allows both more energy and more control of the source than gravitational weightdrop providing better depth penetration control of signal frequency content

        Thumping may be less damaging to the environment than firing explosives in shotholes though a heavily thumped seismic line with transverse ridges every few meters might create longlasting disturbance of the soil An advantage of the thumper later shared with Vibroseis especially in politically unstable areas is that no explosives are required

        EMP sources based on the electrodynamic and electromagnetic principles

        A Seismic vibrator propagates energy signals into the Earth over an extended period of time as opposed to the near instantaneous energy provided by impulsive sources The data recorded in this way must be correlated to convert the extended source signal into an impulse The source signal using this method was originally generated by a servocontrolled hydraulic vibrator or shaker unit mounted on a mobile base unit but electromechanical versions have also been developed

        The Vibroseis exploration technique was developed by the Continental Oil Company Conoco during the 1950s and was a trademark until the companys patent lapsed

        Boomer sound sources are used for shallow water seismic surveys mostly for engineering survey applications Boomers are towed in a floating sled behind a survey vessel Similar to the plasma source a boomer source stores energy in capacitors but it discharges through a flat spiral coil instead of generating a spark A copper plate adjacent to the coil flexes away from the coil as the capacitors are discharged This flexing is transmitted into the water as the seismic pulse

        Originally the storage capacitors were placed in a steel container the bang box on the survey vessel The high voltages used typically 3000 V required heavy cables and strong safety containers Recently low voltage boomers have become available These use capacitors on the towed sled allowing efficient energy recovery lower voltage power supplies and lighter cables The low voltage systems are generally easier to deploy and have fewer safety concerns

        Correlationbased processing techniques also enable seismologists to image the interior of the Earth at multiple scales using natural eg the oceanic microseism or artificial eg urban background noise as a seismic source For example under ideal conditions of uniform seismic illumination the correlation of the noise signals between two seismographs provides an estimate of the bidirectional seismic impulse response

        The Malaysian moon moth Actias maenas is a Saturniid in the subfamily Saturniinae from Indomalaya The male is purplishbrown and yellow while the larger female is overall light green

        The species is considered to form a superspecies complex that includes Actias ignescens Moore 1877 from the Andamans Actias isis Sonthonnax 1897 from Sulawesi and Actias groenendaeli Roepke 1954 from Flores Timor and Sumba Actias rosenbergii Kaup 1895 from Ambon is of doubtful status This species is further divided into subspecies with the nominate from Continental Asia and A m diana Maassen 1872 from Sundas and in the Philippines

        The Malaysian moon moth ranges from Malaysia to Sumatra Java the Philippines and the surrounding region in Southeast Asia and South Asia including a population in the Western Ghats This species covers a diverse set of biomes from tropical rainforests to evergreen forests

        The first instar larva is orange with a black band surrounding the middle segments and with a black head capsule At the first moult the second instar larva is green with yelloworange tubercles a brown head capsule and some black markings behind the head and upon the rear claspers and anal flap At the third instar the dark marks behind the head capsule diminish and larvae develop fine white dot patterning across their skin
        Larvae rest in a position where the anterior end of the body is held free of the substrate such as a leaf or a stem Males finish development a few days earlier than females in larval and pupal stages because they are smaller Pupae are dark brown with a transparent window area between compound eye covers Cocoons are irregular in shape and have a papery texture They are light brown with a glossy sheen and have a preformed exit opening at the anterior end Adults push out of their flimsy cocoons with ease 45 minutes after emergence wing expansion is complete Once the forewings have completely expanded tail expansion begins Females fly after their wings have hardened Females emit pheromones and mate after their first flight

        Adult Actias maenas exhibit striking sexual dimorphism Adult males are bright yellow and have purplishbrown markings while adult females are light green in color

        VX videocassette format
        VX was a shortlived and unsuccessful consumer analog recording videocassette format developed by Matsushita and launched in 1975 in Japan In the United States it was sold using the Quasar brand and marketed under the name The Great Time Machine to exhibit its timeshifting capabilities since VX machines had a companion electromechanical clock timer for timed recording of television programs In Japan the VX100 model was launched in 1975 with the VX2000 following in 1976 The first and only model sold in North America was the Quasar VR1000 based on the Panasonic VX2000 with the VT100 timer

        The VX cassette itself had both reels of magnetic tape stacked on top of each other in a coaxial fashion much like the earlier Philips VCR and Cartrivision formats in the bottom half of the tape with a circular opening on the underside of the top half of the cassette where the video head drum would enter The tape in this opening was preformed in a loop to go around the head drum eliminating the need for the tape to be pulled out of the cassette and threaded around the drum as with later videocassette formats such as VHS and Betamax The opening was protected by a cylindrical plastic plug to protect the tape which was unscrewed from the opening when the tape was loaded in the machine by means of moving a horizontal lever on the front of the machine and inserted back into the tape when ejected by moving the lever back

        The video head drum itself of a VX machine also has the unique distinction of being completely removable and replaceable without any special tools or equipment The drum has a knurled nut on top which can be adjusted by hand allowing the drum to be removed from the deck for cleaning or replacement To this date the VX machines have been the only VCR designed with this feature

        Hand fetishism
        Hand fetishism or hand partialism or also Quirofilia is the sexual fetish for hands This may include the sexual attraction to a specific area such as the fingers palm or nails or the attraction to a specific action performed by the hands which may otherwise be considered nonsexualsuch as washing or drying dishes This fetish may manifest itself as a desire to experience physical interaction or as a source of sexual fantasy

        Hand fetishism is recognized by the porn industry however aside from handjobs it is one of the least common fetishes despite foot fetishism being the most common

        Hand fetishism is usually based in the biological indication that a partner is healthy and a good potential mate

        A hand fetish is a sexual attraction to the hands This attraction is most commonly expressed with fingering handjobs sucking on the fingers and licking the palms

        Fingernail fetishism a subtype of hand fetishism is often expressed with scratching with the fingernails and painting the fingernails

        In 2007 a study was conducted by the University of Bologna on around 5000 fetishist participants to see the prevalence of fetishes The study analyzed the content inside online fetish communities and found only 669 participants referring to nails an extension of hand fetishism This did not refer to fingernails specifically and the amount of 669 was less than 1 of the participants

        In the animemanga series JoJos Bizarre Adventure the character Yoshikage Kira is a serial killer who murders women in order to pretend to date their severed hands

        In quantum mechanics a phase factor is a complex coefficient e that multiplies a ket formula2 or bra formula3 It does not in itself have any physical meaning since the introduction of a phase factor does not change the expectation values of a Hermitian operator That is the values of formula4 and formula5 are the same However differences in phase factors between two interacting quantum states can sometimes be measurable such as in the Berry phase and this can have important consequences

        Roy Lewis 6 November 1913  1996 was an English writer and small press printer

        Although born in Felixstowe Lewis was brought up in Birmingham and educated at King Edwards School After studying at University College Oxford earning his BA in 1934 he went on to study at the London School of Economics He began his career as an economist but after serving as an editor on the journal Statist he became interested in journalism He took a sabbatical in 1938 to travel to Australia and India He married Christine Tew in 1939 after returning to England They had two daughters

        Beginning in July 1939 he collaborated with Randal Heymanson to produce a newsletter called Vital News that they distributed confidentially to British and American government policymakers and bankers until December 1941

        From 1943 to 1946 he worked for the Peking Syndicate a firm specialising in investments in China but left to work as a journalist for the weekly Scope Hired by the Economist magazine he served as its Washington DC correspondent from 1952 to 1961 He settled fulltime in England in 1961 where he became a feature writer for The Times remaining with the newspaper until he retired in 1971 In 1957 he had set up the Keepsake Press initially to hand print family ephemera He soon began serious though smallscale production and by the time infirmity forced him to discontinue in 1990 he had brought out over a hundred titles

        The majority of the books that Lewis wrote or edited often jointly were nonfiction and closely related to his journalism However he is best known for his 1960 novel The Evolution Man which went through six editions under a number of titles This comic novel purports to be a firsthand account by the son of the first man to discover fire To prevent further advances the family takes matters in hand leading to a conclusion given away by the books eventual subtitle how I ate my father Continuing authorship into old age Lewis published a second novel in 1990 the same year that a play of his on William Shakespeare was performed in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe followed by a novella in 1991 and a further novel in 1995 All three of these later fictions were provocative reinterpretations of Victorian times

        Rhamphorhynchoidea
        The Rhamphorhynchoidea forms one of the two suborders of pterosaurs and represent an evolutionary grade of primitive members of this group of flying reptiles This suborder is paraphyletic in relation to the Pterodactyloidea which arose from within the Rhamphorhynchoidea not from a more distant common ancestor Because it is not a completely natural grouping Rhamphorhynchoidea is not used as a formal group in most scientific literature though some pterosaur scientists continue to use it as an informal grouping in popular works such as The Pterosaurs From Deep Time by David Unwin and in some formal studies Rhamphorhynchoids were the first pterosaurs to have appeared in the late Triassic Period Norian age about 210 million years ago Unlike their descendants the pterodactyloids most rhamphorhynchoids had teeth and long tails and most species lacked a bony crest though several are known to have crests formed from soft tissue like keratin They were generally small with wingspans rarely exceeding 25 meters though one species alluded to by Alexander Stoyanow might be among the largest pterosaurs of all time with a wingspan of 10 meters comparable to the largest azhdarchids Nearly all had become extinct by the end of the Jurassic Period though least one anurognathid genus Dendrorhynchoides persisted to the early Cretaceous The family Wukongopteridae which shows a mix of rhamphorhynchoid and pterodactyloid features is known from the Daohugou Beds which are most commonly dated to the Jurassic but a few studies give a Cretaceous date Further more remains of a nonpterodactyloid from the Candeleros Formation extend the presence of basal pterosaurs into the at least early Late Cretaceous

        Lysyl oxidase
        Lysyl oxidase LOX also known as proteinlysine 6oxidase is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LOX gene Its inhibition can cause osteolathyrism but at the same time its upregulation by tumor cells may promote metastasis of the existing tumor causing it to become malignant and cancerous

        In the yeast strain Pichia pastoris lysyl oxidase constitutes a homodimeric structure Each monomer consists of an active site that includes a CuII atom coordinated with three histidine residues as well as 245trihydroxyphenalanine quinone TPQ a crucial cofactor

        In humans the LOX gene is located on chromosome 5q233312 The DNA sequence encodes a polypeptide of 417 amino acids the first 21 residues of which constitute a signal peptide with a weight of approximately 32 kDa The carboxyterminus contains the active copper II ion lysine tyrosine and cysteine residues that comprise the catalytically active site The threedimensional structure of human lysyl oxidase has not yet been resolved

        The mechanism of lysyl oxidase occurs via modification of the amino group of a lysine side chain The enzyme falls into the category of quinonecontaining copper amine oxidases and the reaction is highly dependent on the cofactor lysyl tyrosylquinone LTQ The LTQ cofactor is unique among quinones due to its orthobenzoquinone structure and neutral charge under physiological pH This can be contrasted with the similar ubiquitous quinocofactor TPQ which exists as a negatively charged structure under physiological conditions and includes orthoparacarbonyl resonance functionality

        LTQ is crucial in LOXcatalyzed conversion of lysine residues to aminoadipidicsemialdehydes generally referred to as allysines In the oxidation of lysine the amine is first converted to a Schiff base via reaction with LTQ While LTQ is still bound to the substrate ratelimiting removal of the proton yields an imine intermediate Subsequent hydrolysis of the imine leads to release of the aldehyde product allysine Molecular oxygen and the copper ion are utilized to reoxidize the cofactor and yield another imine producing hydrogen peroxide as a side product Additional hydrolysis releases ammonia and the original cofactor completing the catalytic cycle

        Lysyl oxidase is an extracellular copperdependent enzyme that catalyzes formation of aldehydes from lysine residues in collagen and elastin precursors These aldehydes are highly reactive and undergo spontaneous chemical reactions with other lysyl oxidasederived aldehyde residues or with unmodified lysine residues This results in crosslinking collagen and elastin which is essential for stabilization of collagen fibrils and for the integrity and elasticity of mature elastin

        Complex crosslinks are formed in collagen pyridinolines derived from three lysine residues and in elastin desmosines derived from four lysine residues that differ in structure

        The importance of lysyl oxidasederived crosslinking was established from animal studies in which lysyl oxidase was inhibited either by nutritional copperdeficiency or by supplementation of diets with aminopropionitrile BAPN an inhibitor of lysyl oxidase This resulted in lathyrism characterized by poor bone formation and strength hyperextensible skin weak ligaments and increased occurrence of aortic aneurysms These abnormalities correlated well with decreased crosslinking of collagen and elastin

        Developmentally reduced lysyl oxidase levels have been implicated in Menkes disease and Occipital horn syndrome two Xlinked recessive disorders characterized by a mutation in a gene for copper transportation Thus not only is LOX crucial to cardiovascular development it is thought to play a major role in connective tissue development and may also be important in neurological function

        Lysyl oxidase has also proven crucial to the development of the respiratory system and the skin as collagen and elastin represent 5060 of the composition of the lung and 75 of the skin In LOX double knockout models Lox  function of LOX was reduced by up to 80 and the phenotype of the lungs resembles those of human patients with emphysema and dilated distal airways

        Finally lysyl oxidase plays a crucial role in the commitment step of adipocyte or fat cell formation from pluripotent stem cells during development Its absence may lead to defects in the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of proteins which control cell growth and differentiation

        LOX expression is regulated by hypoxiainducible factors HIFs and hence LOX expression is often upregulated in hypoxic breast and head and neck tumors Patients with high LOXexpressing tumors have poor overall survival Furthermore inhibition of LOX has been demonstrated to eliminate metastases in mice Secreted LOX is responsible for the invasive properties of hypoxic cancer cells through focal adhesion kinase activity and celltomatrix adhesion LOX may be required to create a niche permissive for metastatic growth and thus may be required for hypoxiainduced metastasis In fact recent research has shown overexpression of LOX as crucial to promoting tumor growth and metastasis in several cancers including breast cancer melanoma nonsmall cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer

        LOX expression was also detected in megakaryocytes or bone marrow cells responsible for the production of platelets Data derived from a mouse model of myelofibrosis implicated LOX in bone marrow fibrosis

        In a rodent model of breast cancer a smallmolecule or antibody inhibitors of LOX abolished metastasis LOX secreted by hypoxic breast tumor cells crosslinks collagen in the basement membrane and is essential for CD11b myeloid cell recruitment CD11b cells in turn adhere to crosslinked collagen and produce matrix metalloproteinase2 which cleaves collagen enhancing the invasion of metastasizing tumor cells In contrast LOX inhibition prevents CD11b cell recruitment and metastatic growth

        In cells lacking TGF receptors a deficiency that is characteristic of lung cancer lysyl oxidase is found in high concentrations LOX immunostaining has revealed that high LOX expression is associated with high extent of carcinoma invasion in samples obtained from surgically removed lung adenocarcinomas Additionally LOX expression is an indicator of 5year survival in patients with a 71 chance of survival for patients with low LOX levels compared to 43 for patients with high LOX levels Thus upregulation of lysyl oxidase is a predictor of poor prognosis in earlystage adenocarcinoma patients

        Lysyl oxidase has been newly implicated in tumor angiogenesis or blood vessel formation both in vivo and in vitro Subcutaneous tumorderived LOX was shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF expression and secretion which then promotes angiogenesis by phosphorylation of protein kinase B or Akt through plateletderived growth factor receptor  PDGFRB High levels of LOX were associated with high blood vessel density in patient samples Clinically relevant LOX inhibitors may help slow cancer progression by downregulating crucial growth factors that promote solid tumor progression

        Hence inhibitors of the LOX enzyme may be useful in preventing angiogenesis tumor progression and metastasis as well as treating other fibrotic disease involving remodeling of the extracellular matrix including neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases

        VCord
        VCord is an analog recording videocassette format developed and released by Sanyo VCord later referred to as VCord I was released in 1974 and could record 60 minutes on a cassette VCord II released in 1976 could record 120 minutes on a VCord II cassette

        The VCord II machines were the first consumer VCRs to offer two recording speeds

        The original VCord cassette had a large hub and was wound with standardthickness magnetic tape VCord II used a small hub wound with thin tape the same thickness later used for VHS120 and Beta L750 The cassettes were rectangular unlike subsequent formats VHS and Betamax which loaded with the tape facing front on the long side of the cassette the VCord cartridge was loaded sideways with the narrow side serving as the front and the tape coming out the side

        The tape was held in place in the machine by a notch halfway down the right side of the tape similar to what holds an 8track tape into its player

        The earliest machines recorded only in black and white and had no rewind mechanism like the Cartrivision format of a few years earlier an external rewinder was used after recording or playing a tape External rewinders were later used with the VHS and Beta formats although the machines could rewind tapes external rewinders were considerably faster than the rewind function

        The system had two recording modes standard mode STD and a longplay mode LP which sacrificed recording quality for extra capacity In STD mode both recording and playback heads are used writing both fields of each interlaced video frame In longplay mode only a single head is used to record a single field from each video frame with each field being read twice on playback in a skip field technique The heads scanned the tape in a helical scan fashion

        Tape was moved forward at 291 inches per second in STD mode and 145 inches per second in LP mode this gave a recording time of onehour in standard mode and two hours in longplay mode Horizontal resolution in color was quoted as 250 lines in advertising materials stretching to 300 lines in blackandwhite with a video signaltonoise ratio of 45dB Audio response was specified as 80 to 10000Hz at 6dB in STD mode dropping to 80 to 8000Hz in LP mode

        The tape was a halfinch cobalt doped tape with a 550 oersted coercivity The cassette measured 4 by 6 by 1 Two cassette types were available a V60 and a V120 whose names matched their recording capacity in LP mode The cassettes are similar in appearance to eighttrack cartridges

        Conventional VHS and Beta formats recorded in a helical scan format resulting in angled tracks running from the lower edge of the tape to the upper edge some distance down Unlike these formats the VCord format was closer to the 2inch quadruplex videotape format used from the inception of video in the late 1950s until 2inch helical IVC videotape format was introduced twenty years later in that its tracks ran nearly perpendicular to tape travel

        A portable fourhead video recorder the Sanyo VTC7100 used a similar format of cassette but produced incompatible recordings

        Cliff Barnes
        Clifford Cliff Barnes played by Ken Kercheval is a fictional character from the popular American television series Dallas The Barnes family are competitors and sometimes enemies of the Ewing family Cliff is the son of Willard Digger Barnes and Rebecca Barnes the older halfbrother of Pamela Barnes Ewing and Katherine Wentworth JR Ewing played by Larry Hagman was Cliffs personal nemesis with Cliff and JR continuing on the bitter feud that started with their fathers Digger Barnes and Jock Ewing from their oil wildcatting days in the 1930s Cliff and JR were the only two characters to appear throughout the entire run of the series A running gag on the series is Cliffs fondness for Chinese takeout

        During the shows original conception the character of Cliff was modeled on the late Robert F Kennedy However he evolved into a bumbling sad sack who was very much his own worst enemy A lawyer and a bureaucrat not an oil man Cliff was out of his element when dealing in the cutthroat oil business and despite repeated attempts would always be outsmarted and outdone by his rival JR Thanks to Carter McKay Cliff finally beats JR in the final season and takes over Ewing Oil

        Cliff had a close relationship with his sister Pamela played by Victoria Principal and hated that she married Bobby Ewing played by Patrick Duffy JRs younger brother

        When Dallas began Cliff worked for the state of Texas building an impressive recorded reputation as investigator of corruption within the independent oil companies It was no coincidence that these investigations often cited or targeted Ewing Oil During the second and third seasons Cliffs career took an upward swing when he was appointed Chief of the Office of Land Management a fictional enormously powerful state agency that coordinated and approved all ventures that affected the surface and geological texture of Texas land including oil drilling permits In an attempt to lure Barnes out of this powerful position JR Ewing enlisted attorney Alan Beam in a scheme to form an exploratory funding committee funds solely provided by JR Ewing promoting Barnes as a candidate for the US Congress The scheme worked as Barnes resigned from his position to run for Congress After his resignation the money flow to the campaign stopped and Barnes was forced to drop out of the race

        Cliff had an affair with JRs wife Sue Ellen played by Linda Gray during the second season of Dallas When Sue Ellen became pregnant it was believed Cliff was the father of her baby After a dizzy spell sent Digger to the doctor he was diagnosed as a carrier of neurofibromatosis a genetic disorder which hed passed on to Cliff As neurofibromatosis poses a greater threat to infants than to adults the doctor strongly advised them not to have children Cliff was worried that John Ross III might develop the potentially fatal disease but Bobby and Pam convinced him to keep quiet They all decided to monitor the babys health until he passed a critical age

        After Cliff was forced to drop out of the Congressional race he quickly figured out that JR had been behind the plot and vowed revenge When a newspaper reporter interviewed Digger about Cliffs resignation he told her that Cliff was really the father of John Ross III Cliff realized that the scandal would embarrass JR and sued for custody In order to prove paternity blood tests had to be performed on Sue Ellen and JR The first test proved inconclusive but a second DNA test confirmed that JR was John Ross IIIs father after all

        In a major step backwards Barnes took a position as a Dallas assistant district attorney Shortly after taking the position Barnes promoted the prosecution of Jock Ewing for a 30yearold murder which was dismissed after ironically Digger Barnes confessed to the murder on his deathbed In season four Cliff Barnes began working with State Senator Dave Culver believing that Culver the son of Sam Culver a Texas and national political icon would be destined for powerful office During this time Cliff also formed a personal relationship with Donna Culver played by Susan Howard who was Daves most trusted advisor and the widow of Sam Relations between Donna and Cliff soured and quickly ended when Dave was appointed to the US Senate and Donnas party committee chose Bobby Ewing instead of Barnes to run for his vacant state senate seat After Bobby Ewing won the senate race as a favor to wife Pam he asked Barnes to be his chief senate counsel Cliff accepted but after a short tenure they had a falling out over Cliffs decision without consulting Bobby to start a senate investigation against JR for alleged organization of a counterrevolution in Southeast Asia

        In the course of the fourth season Cliffs mother Rebecca Wentworth played by Priscilla Pointer made a dramatic reentry into his life After much debating Cliff forgave her for her desertion It also delighted Cliff that his mother was an important lady who was wealthy and powerful in her own right Rebecca eventually offered him the presidency of Wentworth Tool  Die a small subsidiary of Wentworth Industries which made parts for oil rigs Cliff happily accepted and did extraordinarily well for a time Eventually Cliff asked for and received complete autonomy at Wentworth Tool  Die  but his fortunes took a dramatic downturn when he wasted Wentworth funds on a phony deal engineered by JR Cliffs mother subsequently sacked him  this coupled with Sue Ellens decision to remarry JR around the same time drove Cliff to attempt suicide

        Cliff recovered and Rebecca subsequently bought out Wade Luce Oil renaming it BarnesWentworth Oil Rebecca asked Cliff to run the company for her and he accepted  blaming JR for Cliffs suicide attempt Rebecca encouraged Cliff to use the company and the place in the Cartel which came with it to gain revenge Armed with a new lease on life and a new hatred for the Ewings he became driven to succeed and as a result turned BarnesWentworth into a very successful company That year Cliff won the coveted Oil Man Of the Year award at the Oil Barons Ball However instead of enjoying his success he embarrassed himself by verbally trashing Jock Ewing and Ewing Oil during his acceptance speech resulting in a huge brawl

        Rebecca died soon after from injuries sustained in a plane crash and Cliff inherited BarnesWentworth Oil as well as a third of Wentworth Industries much to the disgust of his half sister Katherine
        During the fifth season Cliff and Sue Ellen became romantically involved again and he proposed marriage however she turned him down and eventually remarried JR Cliff did find happiness again with aspiring singer Afton Cooper played by Audrey Landers the sister of Lucy Ewings husband Mitch Cooper It would later transpire that Afton gave birth to a daughter Pamela Rebecca after the end of her relationship with Cliff At the start of the penultimate season it was revealed that Pamela was indeed Cliffs daughter although Afton disgusted by Cliffs lying to her tricked him into believing otherwise

        Cliff married Jamie Ewing daughter of the late Jason Ewing and therefore a cousin of JR and Bobby played by Jenilee Harrison in 1985 but the union was unhappy at first Cliff having married Jamie purely for the inheritance he always believed to be his birthright During the 198586 season they realized how much they loved one another and became close In April 1986 Jamie was seen trapped in a blazing car and presumed dead But the entire 198586 season turned out to be the nightmare of Cliffs sister Pam So Cliff and Jamies happy marriage and her supposed death were just a dream and thus Cliff and Jamie never found happiness She left him in fall 1986 and the union was headed for a divorce when it was explained that Jamie was killed due to a fall while on a mountain climbing holiday

        Cliff eventually realizes his dream of taking over a share of Ewing Oil and for a time enjoys a good personal and business relationship with Bobby whilst JR is temporarily sidelined from the business It is notable that Cliff and Bobby appear to find mutual respect and liking only after Pamela has gone and their family ties are effectively severed Cliff is also shown at this time to be a loving and attentive uncle to Christopher who is suffering from the absence of his mother Cliff enjoys a seemingly open welcome to Southfork during this time something that would have been unheard of in earlier seasons JR eventually returned to Ewing Oil and while they were briefly able to coexist it didnt last JRs maneuvering and Cliffs inattention to the business due to his attempts to win back Afton the only woman I ever loved soon had Cliff falling out of favor once again with the Ewings By the end of the series the feud that had characterized much of Dallass run was firmly back on

        A theme of Cliff Barnes character was social class conflict with his nemesis JR Ewing Cliff had grown up poor in contrast to JR after the partnership between Cliffs father Digger and Jock Ewing dissolved due in large part to Diggers heavy drinking Jock went on to found Ewing Oil Digger blamed Jock for his subsequent bad luck and was jealous of Jocks wealth Cliff inherited Diggers resentment of the Ewings and as well as the tendency to sometimes drink heavily As time went on his hatred for the Ewings with the exception of JR dissipated as Cliff realized that his father was not blameless in regards to the BarnesEwing feud Throughout the series Cliff had a reputation for being cheap and naive in contrast to JR Whereas JR always dined in fine restaurants wore a stylish Stetson lived on Southfork and lavished his mistresses with generosity Cliff often preferred takeout Chinese cuisine wore cheap suits lived in a condominium and assumed his romantic interests would clean his home While JR was smooth talking and charismatic Cliff tended to speak before he thought and frequently stuck his foot in his mouth Much of the drama of Dallas was centered around Cliffs attempts to revenge himself against JR politically romantically and financially Typically Cliffs schemes failed because of JRs underhanded cleverness

        Cliff eventually got one over JR shortly before the TV series ended when he took over Ewing Oil

        In the series finale Conundrum in 1991 Cliff appears in JRs dream where with JR having never born he was never pulled into the BarnesEwing feud He became a lawyer who was married to a woman who loved him for himself not his money and had two grown children He turns out to have become Vice President of the United States and at a party learns the President has suffered a stroke and he will be soon taking office

        Cliff appeared in the 1996 film  wherein after 5 years at Ewing Oil he decides he has had enough of the oil business and looks to sell Initially making a deal with West Star head Carter McKay he eventually sells the company to Bobby and Sue Ellen effectively ending the feud with JR when he decides that reuniting with his family Afton and his longlost daughter Pamela is more important than beating JR

        Cliff reappeared in the 2012 continuation of the series which picks up 20 years after the original series concluded and ignores the events of the two 1990s TV movies

        As the series begins Cliff is involved in a casino business He returns to Dallas and has a meeting with Bobby at Southfork Ranch Cliff wants to buy Southfork which Bobby has put up for sale JR walks in on their conversation and warns Cliff against trying to buy the Ewing family home Cliff later invites his adoptive nephew Christopher and his new wife Rebecca to dinner and expresses an interest in investing in Christophers energy project Christopher declines as he thinks that Cliff just wants to antagonize the Ewings again however Cliff warns him not to let the Ewings destroy him like they did his adoptive mother Pamela When JR arrives at Sue Ellens office to give her Miss Ellies pearls a good luck charm for her Texas gubernatorial campaign Cliff arrives to take Sue Ellen to lunch to discuss politics When questioned about trying to buy Southfork Cliff announces I will never stop fighting for what is rightfully mine

        In addition sometime between the end of the original series and the 2012 continuation Cliff Barnes started a new company Barnes Global which owns hundreds of subsidiaries in over fifty countries His desire to spite the Ewing family persists and Cliff eventually directs the bombing of a methaneextracting rig belonging to Ewing Energies which results in the deaths of Christopher and Rebeccas two unborn children As an aside no mention was ever made of the neurofibromatosis gene that Cliff carries Years before hed vowed never to have children because he feared they could die of the disease As the gene is passed from the carrier to their offspring the risk that Rebecca or her children could suffer is high

        The ensuing events result at the end of season two in the Ewings taking control of Barnes Global and folding it into a larger company known as Ewing Global with Cliff sitting in a Mexican jail charged with murdering JR Ewing However he managed to reach out to Elena Ramos and reveal more of JRs nefarious business tactics In a surprising twist he revealed to Elena her father had been fleeced out of the land JR managed to profit off of by having the deed to part of his familys land and her fathers land switched so Elenas father got the piece of land that lacked any oil As her father lost his life trying to find oil on it and her brother trafficked drugs to purchase the land back from the Ewings his revelation seemed to sway her He told Elena to make the Ewings pay for JRs sins against her family and gave her proxy over the onethird share of Barnes Global he still owned in the company

        It is revealed in the season one finale that Christophers wife known to him as Rebecca Sutter is actually Cliffs daughter Pamela known in the original series as Pamela Rebecca Cooper Cliff is shown to be behind Rebeccas attempt to hustle Christopher

        Although Pamela had discovered the Ewings had set up Cliff for the murder of JR she had chosen to leave Cliff in prison because he had blown up the rig and caused her to lose her unborn children She had however given him the deed to the land that Digger had deserved only at the expense of not being able to enjoy it Cliff was then left in prison

        Kercheval stated that had Dallas not been cancelled he wouldnt have been back for a fourth season

        A restaurant in Stockholms Vasastan district has operated under the name of the television character for at least two decades In the 1980s a German punk rock band went by the name Cliff Barnes and the Fear of Winning

        Foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration
        The foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration was the foreign policy of the United States during the two term Presidency of Bill Clinton 1993 to 2001 Clintons main foreign policy advisors were Secretaries of State Warren M Christopher 199396 followed by Madeleine Albright 19972001 in his second term The Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union had disintegrated under his predecessor President George H W Bush whom Clinton criticized for being too preoccupied with foreign affairs The United States was the only remaining superpower with a military strength far overshadowing the rest of the world Absent the Cold War Clintons main priority was always domestic affairs especially the domestic economy Foreignpolicy took a backseat except to promote American trade and during unexpected emergencies His emergencies had to do with humanitarian crises which raised the issue of American or NATO or United Nations interventions to protect civilians or armed humanitarian intervention as the result of civil war state collapse or oppressive governments

        President George H W Bush had sent American troops on a humanitarian mission to Somalia but 18 of them were killed and 80 wounded in a botched raid in October 1993 Public opinion and most elite opinion swung heavily against foreign interventions that risked the lives of American soldiers when American national interests were not directly involved That meant humanitarian missions were problematic Clinton agreed and sent Ground troops only once to Haiti where none were hurt He sent the Air Force to do massive bombing in the former Yugoslavia but no American crewmen were lost The major trouble spots during his two terms were in Africa Somalia and Rwanda and Eastern Europe Bosnia Herzegovina and Kosovo in the former Yugoslavia Clinton also tried to resolve longrunning conflicts in Northern Ireland and the Middle East particularly the IsraeliPalestinian conflict
        As a campaigner for election Clinton promised to devote his main attention to domestic policy in contrast to What he called the overemphasis on foreign policies by his opponent George H W Bush On taking office he told his top advisers he could only spare one hour a week meeting with them However Clinton had attended attended graduate school in England and increasingly took a personal interest in foreign affairs especially in his second term His main foreign policy advisors were Secretaries of State Warren M Christopher and Madeleine Albright and National Security Advisors Anthony Lake and Sandy Berger Other key advisors include Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and Strobe Talbott who as Ambassador at large dealt with Russia and India

        Political scientist Stephen Schlesinger argues that Warren Christopher was

        Realizing that increasing international trade would supports Clintons highest priority of economic growth Secretary of Commerce Ronald H Brown led delegations of entrepreneurs businessmen and financiers to South Africa Mexico Saudi Arabia Jordan Israel the West Bank Gaza Egypt Russia Brazil Argentina and Chile China and Hong Kong Ireland India and Senegal He was on a trade mission to wartorn Yugoslavia in 1996 when they all died in an accidental plane crash A special prosecutor was appointed when it was alleged that contributions to the Democratic Party enabled one to join the trade party Over its eight years in office the administration signed 300 trade agreements with other countries
        The Chinese communist regime had crushed the prodemocracy movement at Tiananmen Square in 1989 President Bush voiced American outrage but quietly reassured the Chinese that trade would continue In the 1992 election campaign Clinton criticized Bush for not punishing China However when Clinton took office himself he continued the Bush policies Clintons highest priority was to maintain trade with China boost American exports expand investment in the huge Chinese market and create more jobs at home By granting China temporary most favoured nation status in 1993 his administration minimized tariff levels in Chinese imports Clinton initially conditioned extension of this status on Chinese human rights reforms but ultimately decided to extend the status despite a lack of reform

        In 1998 Clinton paid a friendly nineday visit to China Albright defended the trip by saying Engagement does not mean endorsement In 1999 Clinton signed a landmark trade agreement with China The agreementthe result of more than a decade of negotiationswould lower many trade barriers between the two countries making it easier to export US products such as automobiles banking services and motion pictures The Chinese citizens ability to afford and purchase US goods should have been taken into consideration However the agreement could only take effect if China was accepted into the WTO and was granted permanent normal trade relations status by the US Congress Under the pact the United States would support Chinas membership in the WTO Many Democrats as well as Republicans were reluctant to grant permanent status to China because they were concerned about human rights in the country and the impact of Chinese imports on US industries and jobs Congress however voted in 2000 to grant permanent normal trade relations with China In 2000 Clinton signed a bill granting permanent normal trade relations to China and American imports from China massively increased in the subsequent years Clintons last treasury secretary Lawrence Summers argued that Clintons trade policies were technically the largest tax cut in the history of the world in that they reduced prices on consumer goods by lowering tariffs

        In 1993 Clinton worked with a bipartisan coalition in Congress to overcome objections by labor union and liberal Democrats They passed the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA that Bush had negotiated with Canada and Mexico in 1992 It joined the American Mexican and Canadian economies in a free trade pact It removed many restrictions of trade in agriculture textiles and automobiles provided new protections for intellectual property set up dispute resolution mechanisms and implemented new labor and environmental safeguards NAFTA cost jobs at first but in the long run it dramatically increased the trade among the three countries It increased the number of jobs in the United States but unions complained that it lowered wage rates for some workers However unions blocked his 1997 and 1998 proposals to provide the president with the power to quickly negotiate trade liberalization pacts with limited congressional comment Clintons advocacy of trade agreements sparked a backlash on the left among opponents of globalization A 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle Washington was overshadowed by major protests that descended into violence

        The end of superpower rivalry had freed the UN and NATO and regional security institutions from their previous Cold War mindset and created new opportunities for them to play a more active collective role Despite international norms of state sovereignty and nonintervention the idea that the international community should intervene in a country for the good of its own people gained greater legitimacy International organizations such as the UN and regional security such as NATO the OAS and the OAU would play a role in bestowing legitimacy on the operations and in organizing a collective response Domestically however these new developments at the international level became enmeshed with a longstanding struggle between Congress and the president over war powers and differences in treaties between domestic and international understandings of the term Which branch of government was to control the deployment of American troops occupied these debates almost as much as the merits of the individual interventions These debates were not new with the struggle over war powers being a constant feature of American foreign policy especially since WWII when it first gained superpower status joined international organizations and signed its first mutual defense treaty in more that 150 years Clinton would utilize both the multinational cast and the explicit blessing of international organizations for support in most of these involvements These largely humanitarian operations during his term met much more congressional opposition and enjoyed less frequent congressional authorization than did operations during the Cold War This involvement suggests that the president had found international organizations to be a useful ally in part to decrease and to overcome the resistance of the national legislature

        Just weeks before Clinton took office President George H W Bush had deployed American soldiers to Somalia a coastal nation on the Horn of Africa where people were suffering and dying from starvation and civil war The soldiers were sent to guard food and other relief supplies from being stolen by warring factions After soldiers faced fire from armed clans and 19 soldiers were killed in 1993 in the Battle of Mogadishu the mission quickly lost popularity with the American people Fearing chaos resulting in the starvation of Somalias civilians and to help US Forces defend themselves Clinton increased troop presence in the country Demands for withdrawal however grew louder and Clinton ordered troops out of the country in March 1994 This left Somalia in a state of chaos with warlords battling for control Public and elite opinion became strongly opposed to sending American ground troops on combat missions and Clinton agreed He did send ground troops to Haiti but none were engaged in combat He sent the Air Force into Yugoslavia for largescale bombing raids but no crewmen were lost

        In April 1994 genocide in Rwanda erupted due to a longstanding conflict between the majority Hutu and dominant Tutsi ethnic groups In little more than 100 days Hutu militia massacred about 800000 Tutsi men women and children The small UN force on the scene was helpless European nations flew in to remove their own nationals then Flew out There was a strong consensus in the United States at both the elite and popular levels that the United States should not send in largescale combat forces to stop the massacres American officials avoided the word genocide because that would justify military intervention Clinton later called his inaction his worst mistake

        The Hutu militia were highly effective in killing Tutu civilians but they were ineffective when a large Tutu armed force based in neighboring Uganda invaded in July seized full control of the entire nation of Rwanda By the end of July 1994 nearly two million Hutus fled the country for safety flooding into refugee camps in neighboring countries As many thousands of refugees died of disease and starvation Clinton ordered airdrops of food and supplies for the Hutu refugees including known genocidaires In July he sent 200 noncombatant troops to the Rwanda capital of Kigali to manage the airport and distribute relief supplies These troops were withdrawn by October 1994 Clinton and the United Nations faced criticism for their nonresponse to the genocide When Clinton traveled to Africa in 1998 he said that the international community presumably including the US must accept responsibility for the failure to respond to the massacres When speaking about the Rwanda Crisis Clinton called it his worst failure admitting I blew it During his African trip Clinton also referred to the concept of the new generation of African leaders

        In August 1998 terrorists bombed the United States embassies in the capitals of two East African countries Nairobi Kenya and Dar es Salaam Tanzania About 250 people were killed including 12 Americans and more than 5500 were injured After intelligence linked the bombings to Osama bin Laden a wealthy Saudi Arabian living in Afghanistan who was suspected of terrorist activity Clinton ordered missile attacks on sites in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the bombings at the US embassies and to deter future terrorist attacks The Clinton administration maintained that the sitesa pharmaceutical factory at Khartoum the capital of Sudan and several alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistanwere involved in terrorist activities

        Much of Clintons reluctant focus was the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina a nation in southeastern Europe that had declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1992 The Bush administration decided with the Cold War over Yugoslavia was no longer a high American priority Trouble there could be less left to Europe to handle But Clinton was outraged by the humanitarian disaster and decided to play a role This declaration was the catalyst of a war between Bosnian Serbs who wanted Bosnia to remain in the Yugoslav federation and Bosnian Muslims and Croats The Bosnian Serbs who were supported by Serbia were better equipped than the Muslims and the Croats as a result they populated and controlled much of the countryside in ways including besieging cities such as the capital of Sarajevo This caused widespread suffering and in response

        In early 1993 the Clinton administration decided on aggressive action ignoring both the United Nations and key European allies The proposed policy was called lift and strike The plan was to lift the arms embargo the UN had imposed on all sides which left the Bosnian Muslims unarmed The US would arm them so they could defend themselves until they were fully prepared to fight for themselves the US would hit the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes to keep them back Christopher traveled to Europe to win support from Britain France and Germany but they were all staunchly opposed By the time Christopher returned to Washington support for the plan had evaporated based on memories of Vietnam and fears of being plunged into a chaotic war with no end in sight In 1994 Clinton opposed an effort by the Republicans in Congress to lift the arms embargo as it were because American allies were still resistant to that policy

        Clinton continued to pressure western European countries throughout 1994 to take strong measures against the Serbs But in November as the Serbs seemed on the verge of defeating the Muslims and Croats in several strongholds Clinton changed course and called for conciliation with the Serbs After the 2nd Markale massacre in which Bosnian Serb forces reportedly shelled a crowded marketplace in Sarajevo NATO led by the United States launched Operation Deliberate Force with a series of airstrikes against Bosnian Serb targets In July 1995 as the tide of war was turning against the Bosnian Serbs local Bosnian forces under the command of General Ratko Mladi forced the surrender of the Bosnian stronghold of Srebrenica near the eastern border with Serbia A small UN force was helpless and the defenders surrendered with the promise that no civilians or soldiers would be harmed if they surrendered Instead Mladis forces massacred over 7000 Bosnians It was the worst massacre in Europe In 40 years and galvanized NATO Intervention The escalating air campaign along with a counteroffensive by betterequipped Muslim and Croatian forces succeeded in pressuring the Bosnian Serbs into participating in negotiations In November 1995 Clinton hosted peace talks between the warring parties in Dayton Ohio The parties reached a peace agreement known as the Dayton Agreement leaving Bosnia as a single state made up of two separate entities with a central government In 2011 Serbia was forced to turn over Mladi to the United Nations and in 2017 he was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of genocide

        According to historian David N Gibbs

        In the spring of 1998 ethnic tension in the Federal Republic of Yugoslaviathe state formed from the former Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegroheightened when the military forces responded in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija More than 90 percent of the residents of Kosovo were Muslim and ethnic Albanians many of whom wanted independence from the country Yugoslav forces were mobilized into province to quell Albanian rebels

        Through attempting to impose the Rambouillet Agreement Clinton who strongly supported the Albanians threatened the Yugoslav administration with military strikes On 24 March 1999 NATO led by the United States launched the twomonth bombardment of Yugoslavia The strikes were not limited to military installations and NATO targets included civilian targets such as factories oil refineries television stations and various infrastructure The intervention which devastated Yugoslavia was not approved by the UN General Assembly or the UN Security Council and was strongly opposed by both Russia and China It was the first time in NATOs history that its forces had attacked a sovereign country and the first time in which air power alone won a battle In June 1999 NATO and Yugoslav military leaders approved an international peace plan for Kosovo and attacks were suspended after Yugoslav forces withdrew from Kosovo

        Clinton also sought to end the conflict in Northern Ireland by arranging a peace agreement between the nationalist and unionist factions In 1998 former Senator George Mitchellwhom Clinton had appointed to assist in peace talkssupported an accord that became known as the Good Friday Agreement It called for the British Parliament to devolve legislative and executive authority of the province to a new Northern Ireland Assembly whose Executive would include members of both communities Years of stalemate have followed the agreement mainly due to the refusal of the Provisional Irish Republican Army IRA a nationalist paramilitary group to decommission its weapons for some years and after that the refusal of the Democratic Unionist Party to push the process forward Mitchell returned to the region and arranged yet another blueprint for a further peace settlement that resulted in a December 1999 formation of the powersharing government agreed the previous year which was to be followed by steps toward the IRAs disarmament That agreement eventually faltered as well although Clinton continued peace talks to prevent the peace process from collapsing completely In 2005 the IRA decommissioned all of its arms and in 2007 Sinn Fin expressed a willingness to support the reformed Police Service of Northern Ireland PSNI Power was restored to the Assembly in May 2007 marking renewed promise for the fulfillment of the Good Friday Agreement

        For further information on the overarching strategy of President Clintons approach to the Middle East particularly Iraq and Iran see dual containment

        Clinton was likewise deeply involved in the Middle East peace process to negotiate peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians as well as with the governments of Egypt Jordan Syria and Lebanon Secret negotiations mediated by Clinton between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat led to a historic declaration of peace in September 1993 called the Oslo Accords Clinton personally arranged for the peace accord to be signed at the White House on September 13 1993 The agreement allowed a limited Palestinian selfrule in the Israelioccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip Following up after Oslo Secretary of State Christopher encouraged Jordans King Hussein to make a peace treaty with Israel Christopher offered Hussein 200 million in military equipment and 700 million in debt forgiveness to sweeten the deal On October 27 1994 Rabin and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdelsalam alMajali signed the IsraelJordan peace treaty It was the second piece treaty for Israel after Egypt Christopher sought to obtain a Third treaty between Rabin and Syrian President Hafez alAssad but to no avail

        The 1993 and 1995 peace agreements between Israel and Palestine however did not end the conflict in the Middle East As the peace process came to a stall Clinton invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to peace talks on the Wye River in October 1998 The two leaders signed yet another agreement known as the Wye River Memorandum which called for Israel to transfer more territory in the West Bank to the Palestinians In return the Palestinians agreed to take steps to curb terrorism They also agreed to a timetable to negotiate a final resolution of the Palestinian fight for an independent state

        After an abrupt outbreak of violence sparked by the agreement however Netanyahu refused to cede any more West Bank territory and placed new demands upon Palestine His ceding of territory had shaken his own coalition though and together with other factors this contributed to the downfall of the Netanyahu government in Israel As a result in May 1999 Israelis elected Ehud Barak the leader of a political coalition that favored resuming the peace process to replace Netanyahu as prime minister Clinton continued to work passionately on negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians Throughout his last year in office Clinton came close to arranging a final peace settlement but failed according to Clinton as a result of Arafats reluctance Clinton related a phone conversation he had with Arafat three days before he left office You are a great man Arafat said Clinton replied The hell I am Im a colossal failure and you made me one

        Clinton was also confronted with problems in Iraq In 1991 two years before Clinton became president the United States under President George H W Bush participated in the Persian Gulf War to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation In 1991 the warring parties signed a ceasefire agreement and the United Nations Security Council passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 requiring Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction and allow inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission UNSCOM to monitor the countrys adherence to the agreement In addition to UN inspections to ensure the Iraqi compliance of Resolution 688 which called for Iraq to end its oppression of Iraqi citizens the nofly zones over Iraq were established by the US and its allies to protect the Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and the Shiites in southern Iraq from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government

        On June 26 1993 Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack on the Iraqi Intelligence Services IIS principal command and control complex in Baghdad publicly announced as retaliation for the assassination attempt by the IIS on former President George H W Bush while he was visiting Kuwait in April of that year to commemorate a coalition victory over Iraq in the Gulf War Fourteen cruise missiles were launched from and nine of them launched from  Sixteen hit the target while three struck a residential area killing nine civilians and wounding 12 others Four missiles were unaccounted for This strike was in violation of international law although that point is contentious

        In October 1994 Baghdad once again began mobilizing around 64000 Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border because of their expressed frustrations of economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations Security Council UNSC In response the US begins to deploy troops in the Persian Gulf to deter Iraqi aggression against Kuwait Codenamed Operation Vigilant Warrior 1st Brigade of the Fort Stewart Georgiabased 24th Infantry Division Mechanized deployed and drew prepositioned equipment in Kuwait The 23rd Wings Flying Tigers 75th Fighter Squadron Tigersharks and its full complement of A10s initially deployed from Pope AFB North Carolina to Dhahran Air Base Saudi Arabia followed by the first forward deployment to Ahmad alJaber Air Base Kuwait This allowed better facetoface coordination with tactical air control parties TACP assets further forward deployed at Camp Doha Kuwait and points north Iraq would later withdraw troops near the Kuwaiti border in response to a massive US military buildup This served to increase US and Coalition resolve to contain Iraqi aggression against their neighbors in the Middle East

        In September 1996 Clinton ordered Operation Desert Strike and ships from the Battle Group including  and  in conjunction with B52 bombers escorted by F14D Tomcats from USS Carl Vinson launched 27 cruise missiles against Iraqi air defense targets in southern Iraq A second wave of 17 was launched later that day The missiles hit targets in and around Kut Iskandariyah Nasiriyah and Tallil This was done in response to Saddam Hussein an Iraqi dictator attempting to launch an Iraqi military offensive campaign in the Kurdish town of Arbil in Iraqi Kurdistan

        In his 1998 State of the Union Address Clinton warned the US Congress of Husseins possible pursuit of nuclear weapons saying

        The UNSCOM team faced resistance from Iraq which blocked inspections and hid deadly germ agents and warheads Clinton then threatened military action several times when Hussein who turned out to be Iraqs President tried stalling the UNSCOM inspections To weaken Husseins grip of power Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act into law on October 31 1998 which instituted a policy of regime change against Iraq though it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces Between December 16 and 19 1998 Clinton ordered fourday period of concentrated air attacks against military installations in Iraq This was in response to Saddams refusal to cooperate with UN inspectors After the bombing Hussein blocked any further UN inspections and announced its attempt to shoot down Coalition aircraft in the nofly zones over Iraq For several years afterward US and Coalition aircraft routinely attacked hostile Iraqi defense installations in Iraq in response to what the Clinton administration claimed were provocations by the Iraqi military including antiaircraft fire and radar locks on US and Coalition aircraft

        The UN sanctions against Iraq that the United Nations Security Council imposed after the Gulf War remained in place during the Clinton administration These sanctions were alleged to have contributed to increased child mortality there although this was disputed Albright later wrote Saddam Hussein could have prevented any child from suffering simply by meeting his obligations Recent research has shown that commonly cited data were fabricated by the Iraqi government and that there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after 1990 and during the period of the sanctions

        President Clintons foreign policy team initially viewed Iran with suspicion and sought to contain Iranian ambitions as part of the dual containment strategy On May 6 1995 Clinton signed Executive Order 12957 which implemented tight oil and trade sanctions on Iran and made it illegal for American corporations or their foreign subsidiaries to participate in any contract for the financing of the development of petroleum resources located in Iran On May 6 1995 President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 which banned almost all trade between US businesses and the Iranian government with the exception of informational materials
        A year before the President declared that Iran was a state sponsor of terrorism and a rogue state marking the first time that an American President used that term

        In 1996 the Clinton administration agreed to compensate the Iranian government for the deaths of 254 Iranians in a 1988 incident in which an Iranian commercial passenger plane was shot down by mistake by an American warship the USS Vincennes In Clintons second term as President beginning in 1997 the administration began to take a softer approach towards Iran particularly after the election of reformist Mohammad Khatami as President of Iran

        In 1995 Albright and Clinton mandated what could be considered an apology to the Iranian people for the 1953 CIAassisted coup that overthrew the Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh and replaced him with the Shah Albright and Clinton also acknowledged that the USbacked government of the Shah oppressed political opponents In the months that followed an Iranian professional wrestling team was allowed entry into the US to face American teams and a significant increase in cultural and academic overtures were made between the two countries In 1998 Iran and the United States faced each other in a game at the FIFA World Cup that year Iran beat the US by 21 Khatami also encouraged Americans to travel to Iran for vacational purposes citing the city of Esfahan a popular location for tourists where according to CNN several wellpreserved sites often surprise tourists In a wellpublicized 1997 interview Khatami refused to fully apologize for the 79 hostage crisis in which 52 American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days yet did offer to open up a dialogue with the American people

        Clinton at one point offered to open up an official dialogue with the Iranian government and renew diplomatic relations with the country after 20 years of no such relations However Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refused to accept the offer for dialogue unless the US formally withdrew its support for Israel lifted the 95 sanctions imposed on the country stopped accusing Tehran of attempting to develop nuclear weaponry and officially ended its policy of considering Iran a rogue state that sponsors terrorism Although Clinton did privately weigh the idea of revoking the executive orders he signed in the spring of 1995 the administration refused to comply with Irans other demands

        Eventually President Clinton did ease restrictions on export of food and medical equipment to Iran Albright announced in 2000 that the US would begin to enable Americans to purchase and import carpets and food products such as dried fruits nuts and caviar from Iran and also was confident that Iran would provide cooperation with the United States in the battle against narcotics and international drug abuse In 1995 the State Department warned US citizens against traveling in Iran due to that governments rampant antiAmericanism yet five years later Albright decided to repeal this warning

        By the time Clinton left office in January 2001 it was clear that relations between Iran and the United States had significantly cooled despite the fact that President Khatami and President Clinton failed to initiate an official diplomatic dialogue between the nations something which has not existed since the 1979 hostage crisis

        In 1994 the Clinton administration announced that it was lifting the trade embargo on Vietnam citing progress on the Vietnam War POWMIA issue regarding the search for American soldiers listed as missing in action and the remains of those killed in action as well as the market reforms that Vietnam implemented from 1986 On July 10 1995 Clinton announced that his administration was restoring full diplomatic relations with Vietnam citing the continued progress in determining the whereabouts of MIAs and locating the remains of soldiers killed in the Vietnam War Clinton nonetheless stressed that the search for Americans would continue especially for the soldiers listed as discrepancies namely 55 American soldiers believed to still be alive when they went missing On November 16 2000 Clinton arrived in Hanoi with his wife Senatorelect Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea shortly before his second term in office ended The next day Clinton spoke to the Vietnamese people publicly about both the conflict as well as the promise renewed relations meant

        In 1995 tense relations with China and the imprisonment of an innocent American in the Communist nation led to pressure for the US to boycott the 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing The US delegation chaired by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Madeleine Albright then the United States Ambassador to the United Nations was assigned with the task of confronting China about its human rights abuses but not so strongly as to damage sensitive relations Hillary Rodham Clinton gave a successful speech before the entire Chinese leadership and the Conference where she without bringing up China or any particular nation attacked human rights abuses against humanity in general and women and girls in particular

        In 199596 the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis happened between Taiwan and China Chinese concerns about the upcoming Taiwanese presidential election as well as the possibility of the declaration of Taiwanese independence led to a series of missile tests right off the coast of Taiwan that could have escalated out of control The Clinton administration responded in March 1996 by staging the biggest display of American military might in Asia since the Vietnam War Numerous aircraft carrier groups were stationed near Taiwan and her group as well as sailed through the Taiwan Strait in a demonstration of support for Taiwan Eventually a ceasefire was declared and China declared the missile tests to be completed

        North Koreas feared aim to create nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles was a serious problem for the Clinton Administration In 1994 North Korea a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty refused to allow international inspectors to review two nuclear waste sites The inspectors wanted to see if North Korea was in violation of the treaty since they were suspected of reprocessing spent fuel into plutonium which could be used to manufacture nuclear weapons Despite diplomatic pressure and repeated warnings by Clinton North Korea refused to allow the inspections and even raised the prospect of war with South Korea an ally of the United States In 1994 Clinton also considered a US military strike on bombing the Yongbyon nuclear reactor He was advised that if war broke out it could cost 52000 US and 490000 South Korean military casualties in the first three months as well as a large number of civilian casualties
        With private diplomacy by former president Jimmy Carter the Clinton administration reached a breakthrough with North Korea in October 1994 when North Korea agreed to shut down the nuclear plants that could produce materials for weapons if the United States would help North Korea build plants that generated electricity with lightwater nuclear reactors These reactors would be more efficient and their waste could not easily be used for nuclear weaponry The United States also agreed to supply fuel oil for electricity until the new plants were built and North Korea agreed to allow inspection of the old waste sites when construction began on the new plants KEDO was established based on this agreement in 1995

        This 1994 Agreed Framework as it was known kept the Yongbyon plutonium enrichment plant closed and under international inspection until 2002 However economic supports by the agreement and KEDO gave an advantage to North Korea and North Korea broke off from the treaty and restarted plutonium production In October 2006 North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon President Bush warned that he was not pleased by such actions as it is he invited the international community to take a stand As a result North Korea the United States Russia China were involved in negotiations and North Korea agreed to close down their nuclear station temporarily

        The 1991 Haitian coup dtat led by Lieutenant General Raoul Cdras had ousted the countrys elected president JeanBertrand Aristide who barely escaped to the United States Shortly thereafter tens of thousands of Haitians also tried to flee to the United States in leaky boats in 1993 increased opposition to Aristide supporters would increase these numbers Relatively few refugees would be allowed legal entry with most being sent back to Haiti or Guantanamo by the United States Coast Guard Clinton had previously criticized former President George H W Bush for doing much the same

        American opinion generally favored Aristide but opposed military intervention Clinton was highly sensitive to his black constituency and the black leadership in Congress pushed for action Vice President Gore and advisor Anthony Lake strongly agreed while Sandy Berger Strobe Talbott Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry went along Clinton agreed but worried about going against the democratic will in his own country to enforce democracy in some other country On September 15 1994 Clinton tried to rally American public opinion with a forceful televised address from the Oval Office He denounced the military junta as armed thugs engaged in a reign of terror executing children raping women killing priests Clinton demanded it leave immediately As American warplanes were being readied for an invasion suddenly former President Jimmy Carter proposed to negotiate a settlement Clinton agreed that Carter Colin Powell and Senator Sam Nunn would fly to Haiti to convince the junta to leave In a matter of 48 hours Carters group achieved the desired transfer of power without any violence In Operation Uphold Democracy American forces landed after the departure of the junta Anthony Lake attributed the success to a combination of power and diplomacy Without Clintons threat of force the junta would never have left Without Carter there would have been fighting Aristide returned to power and Clintons prestige was enhanced Nevertheless six years later conditions were still terrible in Haiti

        After securing the NAFTA treaty that integrated the Mexican and American economies Clinton faced yet another foreign crisis in early 1995 The Mexican peso began to fall sharply and threatened the collapse of the Mexican economy Clinton feared that a collapse would have a negative impact on the United States because of their close economic ties He proposed a plan to address the financial crisis in Mexico but many in Congress hearting that constituents would not favor aid money to Mexico rejected the plan In response Clinton used executive authority to create a 20 billion loan package for Mexico to restore international confidence in the Mexican economy The loan Went through and Mexico completed its loan payments to the United States in January 1997 three years ahead of schedule However issues such as drug smuggling and immigration continued to strain relations

        American foreign policy toward Cuba had been hostile since Fidel Castro aligned the country with the Soviet Union in 1960 Clinton basically continue the policy especially regarding trade embargoes but he faced a difficult problem on what to do with Cuban refugees trying to reach asylum in the United States

        After negotiations with representatives of the Cuban government Clinton revealed in May 1995 a controversial policy reversing the decadesold policy of automatically granting asylum to Cuban refugees Approximately 20000 Cuban refugees detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba were to be admitted to the United States over a period of three months In order to prevent a mass exodus of refugees to the United States all future refugees would be returned to Cuba The influx of refugees into Guantanamo Bay overwhelmed the facilities necessitating Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage involving Panama Clinton also implemented the wet footdry foot policy for Cuban refugees This policy meant that Cuban refugees caught at sea were returned to Cuba wet foot while Cuban refugees that made it to dry land dry foot were allowed to stay in the US This changed the refugees tactics from slow rafts to speed boats

        Relations between the United States and Cuba deteriorated in February 1996 when Cuba shot down two American civilian planes Cuba accused the planes of violating Cuban airspace Clinton tightened sanctions against Cuba and suspended charter flights from the United States to Cuba hoping this would cripple Cubas tourism industry

        In their response to the incident the US Congress passed the HelmsBurton Act in March 1996 The bill strengthened an embargo against imports of Cuban products Title III however made the bill controversial because it allowed American citizens whose property was seized during and after the 1959 Cuban Revolution to sue in American courts foreign companies that later invested in those properties Title III sparked an immediate uproar from countries such as Mexico Canada and members of the European Union because they believed that they would be penalized for doing business with Cuba In response Clinton repeatedly suspended Title III of the legislation the act gave the president the right to exercise this option every six months

        Clinton softened his Cuban policy in 1998 and 1999 In March 1998 at the urging of Pope John Paul II Clinton lifted restrictions and allowed humanitarian charter flights to resume He also took steps to increase educational religious and humanitarian contacts in Cuba The US government decided to allow Cuban citizens to receive more money from American friends and family members and to buy more American food and medicine

        On February 26 1993 thirtysix days after Clinton took office terrorists who the CIA would later reveal were working under the direction of Osama bin Laden detonated a timed car bomb in the parking garage below Tower One of the World Trade Center in New York City see the World Trade Center bombing Clinton responded by ordering his National Security Council under the direction of Anthony Lake and the FBI to find and punish those responsible The FBI was able to quickly identify the vehicle used in the bomb from a remnant found in the rubble a Ryder rental van which had been reported stolen in Jersey City New Jersey the day before The truck was rented by Mohammed Salameh whom the FBI immediately detained Similar evidence led to the arrests of other plotters behind the attack including Nidal Ayyad Mahmoud Abouhalima Ahmad Ajaj and Ramzi Yousefwho was identified as the key player in the bombing All men were tried and convicted for the bombing and other terrorists activities

        In his 1995 State of the Union address Clinton proposed comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists whether they strike at home or abroad He sent legislation to Congress to extend federal criminal jurisdiction make it easier to deport terrorists and act against terrorist fundraising Following the bombing of the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City Clinton amended that legislation to increase wiretap and electronic surveillance authority for the FBI require explosives to be equipped with traceable taggants and appropriate more funds to the FBI CIA and local police

        In June 1995 Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 39 which stated that the United States should deter defeat and respond vigorously to all terrorist attacks on our territory and against our citizens Furthermore it called terrorism both a matter of national security and a crime The implementation of his proposals led to a substantial increase in counterterrorism funds for the FBI and CIA

        In 1996 the CIA established a special unit of officers to analyze intelligence received about bin Laden and plan operations against him coined the Bin Laden Issue Station It was this unit that first realized bin Laden was more than just a terrorist financier but a leader of a global network with operations based in Afghanistan Given these findings the NSC encouraged the Department of State to pay more attention to Afghanistan and its governing unit the Taliban which had received funding from bin Laden The State Department requested the Taliban to expel bin Laden from the country noting that he was a sponsor of terrorism and publicly urged Muslims to kill Americans The Taliban responded that they did not know his whereabouts and even if they did he was not a threat to the United States The CIAs counterterrorism division quickly began drafting plans to capture and remove bin Laden from the country However Marine General Anthony Zinni and some in the State Department protested the move saying that the United States should focus instead on ending the Afghan civil war and the Talibans human rights abuses

        In 1998 Clinton appointed Richard Clarkewho until then served in a drugs and counterterrorism division of the CIAto lead an interagency comprehensive counterterrorism operation the Counterterrorism Security Group CSG The goal of the CSG was to detect deter and defend against terrorist attacks Additionally Clinton appointed Clarke to sit on the cabinetlevel Principals Committee when it met on terrorism issues

        Clintons Counterterrorism Center began drafting a plan to ambush bin Ladens compound in Kandahar The CIA mapped the compound and identified the houses of bin Ladens wives and the location where he most likely slept The plan was relatively simple at least on paper Tribals would subdue the guards enter the compound take bin Laden to a desert outside Kandahar and hand him over to another group of tribals This second group would carry him to a desert landing stripwhich had already been testedwhere a CIA plane would take him to New York for arraignment When they completed a draft plan they ran through two rehearsals in the United States Confident that the plan would work the Counterterrorism Center of the CIA sought the approval of the White House While they acknowledged that the plan was risky they stated that there was a risk in not acting because sooner or later bin Laden will attack US interests perhaps using WMD

        Clarke reviewed the plans for Sandy Berger the National Security Director and told him that it was in the very early stages of development and stressed the importance of only targeting bin Laden not the entire compound The NSC told the CIA to begin preparing the necessary legal documents to execute the raid

        The senior management of the CIA was skeptical of the plan and despite objections canceled the operation fearing that the risk to their operatives and financial costs were too high It is unclear whether or not Clinton was aware of the plan

        As the Counterterrorism Center continued to track bin Laden they learned in 1998 that the Saudi government had bin Laden cells within the country that were planning attacks on US forces CIA Director George Tenet encouraged by the Saudis show of force against bin Laden asked them to assist in the fight against bin Laden Clinton named Tenet as his informal personal representative to work with Saudi Arabia on terrorism The Saudis promised Tenet that they would do everything they could to convince the Taliban to release bin Laden for trial in America or elsewhere The Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal held various meetings with Taliban chief Mullah Omar and other leaders and received assurance that bin Laden would be removed Omar however reneged on that promise

        On August 7 1998 Bin Laden struck again this time with simultaneous bombings on the US embassies in Nairobi Kenya and Dar es Salaam Tanzania see above The CIA having confirmed bin Laden was behind the attack informed Clinton that terrorist leaders were planning to meet at a camp near Khowst to plan future attacks According to Tenet several hundred including bin Laden would attend On August 20 Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on AlQaeda terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum Sudan where bin Laden was suspected of manufacturing biological weapons While the military hit their targets bin Laden was not killed The CIA estimated that they had missed bin Laden by a few hours

        At the time of the attacks Clinton was embroiled in the Lewinsky scandal see below This led many Republicans in Congress to accuse the president of wagging the doglaunching a military attack simply to distract the public from his personal problems Clinton and his principals however insist that the decision was made solely on the basis of national security

        After the attacks failed Clinton moved his focus to diplomatic pressure On the advice of the State Department Clinton encouraged Pakistan whose military intelligence agency was a patron of the Taliban to pressure the Taliban to remove bin Laden After numerous meetings with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif the Pakistanis would still not cooperate Sharif eventually agreed to allow the United States to train Pakistani special forces to find bin Laden When Sharif was ousted by Pervez Musharraf the plan was abandoned

        After encouragement by Richard Clarke Clinton issued an executive order in July 1999 declaring the Taliban regime as a state sponsor of terrorism This was followed in October 1999 by Resolution 1267 sponsored by the United States placing economic and travel sanctions on the Taliban The Taliban however stood by bin Laden and the United States along with Russia proposed yet another UN resolution Resolution 1333 this time imposing an embargo an arms shipments to the Taliban The move was meant to weaken the Taliban in their fight against the Northern Alliance in their civil strife However the resolution did little to limit the illegal flow of arms from Pakistan

        In August 1999 Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification ordering the CIA to develop another plan to capture bin Laden and giving the CIA the authority to order bin Laden be killed

        Near the end of 1999 the Clinton administration working with the government of Jordan detected and thwarted a planned terrorist attack to detonate bombs at various New Year millennium celebrations around the world The CIA confirmed that bin Laden was behind the plot which was disrupted just days before the New Year While many credited Clintons new CSG for playing a role in the foiling of these plots critics claim it was mostly luck

        The CIA informed Clinton that they feared the thwarted attacks were just part of a larger series of attacks planned for the new year Clinton asked Clarke and the CSG to draft plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda attacks

        On October 12 2000 terrorists bombed USS Cole in the harbor of the Yemeni port of Aden The attack on  a US Navy destroyer killed 17 Navy sailors and there was no clear indication during the last months of Clintons term of who was responsible The CIA reported that they had no definitive answer on the crucial question of outside direction of the attackhow and by whom Clinton did not think it would be wise to launch an attack based on a preliminary judgment stating that he would have taken further action had he received definitive intelligence The CIA was eventually able to confirm bin Ladens involvement with certainty a week after the Bush administration took office

        As Clintons second term drew to a close the CSG drafted a comprehensive policy paper entitled Strategy for Eliminating the Threat from the Jihadist Networks of al Qida Status and Prospects The paper outlined a method to roll back al Qaeda over a period of three to five years Clarke stated that while continued antial Qida operations at the current level will prevent some attacks it will not seriously attrit their ability to plan and conduct attacks This policy paper was forwarded to the incoming Bush administration

        In the years since September 11 2001 Clinton has been subject to criticism that he failed to capture Osama bin Laden as President In a September 24 2006 interview with Fox News Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday Clinton challenged his critics According to Clinton he faced criticism from various conservatives during his administration for being too obsessed with Bin Laden Clinton also noted that his administration created the first comprehensive antiterrorist operation led by Richard Clarkewhom Clinton accuses the Bush Administration of demoting Clinton also said he worked hard to try to kill Bin Laden Former international negotiator and current businessman financier and media commentator Mansoor Ijaz claimed that from 19961998 he had opened up unofficial negotiations with Sudan to lift terrorism sanctions from that country in exchange for intelligence information about the terrorist groups Islamic Jihad Hezbollah and Hamas He claimed that Sudan was also prepared to offer custody of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden who had been living in the country and launching operations According to Ijaz neither Clinton nor National Security Advisor Sandy Berger responded to the situation Bin Laden later left Sudan and established his operations in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban and with his network planned out terrorist attacks against American interests worldwide including attacks on American embassies in Tunisia and Sudan as well as the bombing of USS Cole The most infamous were the attacks of September 11 2001 that occurred under Clintons successor George W Bush nine months after Clinton left office However the 911 Commission Report later found no credible evidence to support the Sudan custody offer as the American Ambassador to the Sudan had no legal basis to ask for custody due to no indictment against Bin Laden

        Sudans minister of defense Fatih Erwa has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the United States The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since at the time there was no indictment outstanding

        Clinton acknowledged that following the bombing on USS Cole his administration prepared battle plans to execute a military operation in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and search for bin Laden The plans were never implemented because according to Clinton the CIA and FBI refused to certify that bin Laden was responsible for the bombing until after he left office and the military was unable to receive basing rights in Uzbekistan In relation to Afghanistan Clinton criticized the Bush Administration when he said We do have a government that thinks Afghanistan is oneseventh as important as Iraq Clinton also said that his administration left the plans and a comprehensive antiterror strategy with the new Bush Administration in January 2001

        In 2014 a September 10 2001 audio containing Clintons conservation at a business center at Melbourne Australia 10 hours before the 911 attacks regarding the topic of terrorism was revealed In this audio Clinton stated that according to intelligence agencies Bin Laden was located in Kandahar Afghanistan in December 1998 and thus a missile strike was proposed However he decided not to kill Bin Laden because of conflicting reports of intelligence information to his true whereabouts as well as the potential risk for civilian casualties He stated that Im just saying you know if I were Osama bin Ladenhes a very smart guy Ive spent a lot of time thinking about himand I nearly got him once And then he said that I nearly got him And I could have killed him but I would have to destroy a little town called Kandahar in Afghanistan and kill 300 innocent women and children and then I would have been no better than him And so I didnt do it

        In 1996 Clinton signed the United States onto the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT a landmark international agreement that prohibited all signatory nations from testing nuclear weapons The following year he sent the treaty to the Senate for ratification Conservative Republicans took the lead in defeating the treaty in October 1999 by vote of 48 in favor and 51 against far short of the two thirds It needed to pass International reaction to the Senates action was uniformly negative and the rejection was a political setback for Clinton who had lobbied actively for its approval One scholar blames the failure on

        Despite the rejection of the treaty Clinton promised that the United States would continue to maintain a policy of not testing nuclear weapons which had been in place since 1992

        Throughout the 1990s the Congress refused to appropriate funds for the United States to pay its dues to the United Nations By 1999 the United States owed the UN at least 1 billion in back dues That same year Clinton reached a compromise with Republicans in Congress to submit more than 800 million in back dues Republicans in the House of Representatives had insisted that UN debt repayments be accompanied by restrictions on US funding for international groups that lobbied for abortion rights in foreign countries Clinton had vetoed similar measures in the past but he agreed to the restrictions when faced with the prospect that the United States would lose its vote in the UN General Assembly for nonpayment of dues

        During his first term argues two political scientists

        Public opinion in the United States about the role the country should have in the Bosnian genocide was negative A series of Gallup polls through 19951997 showed that public disapproval of military intervention in Bosnia hovered around 52 with the only outlier occurring in January 1997 where 58 of the population disapproved The polls also found that public opposition was bipartisan with 49 of Republicans and around 40 of Democrats and Independents disapproving

        Americans were even less supportive of involvement in Kosovo A Gallup poll in March 1999 showed that about half of the American public supported NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia That was the weakest support for any American combat mission in the past decade Fewer people were following the news about US involvement in Kosovo falling from 43 to 32 in two months

        The public and the media paid little attention to the Rwanda genocide One reason why the United States did not enter Rwanda is because of the public reluctance to enter combat after the Vietnam War
