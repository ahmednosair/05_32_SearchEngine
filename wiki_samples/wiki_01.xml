Source routing
In computer networking source routing also called path addressing allows a sender of a packet to partially or completely specify the route the packet takes through the network In contrast in conventional routing routers in the network determine the path incrementally based on the packets destination Another routing alternative label switching is used in connectionoriented networks such as X25 frame relay ATM and MPLS

Source routing allows easier troubleshooting improved traceroute and enables a node to discover all the possible routes to a host It does not allow a source to directly manage network performance by forcing packets to travel over one path to prevent congestion on another

Many highperformance interconnects including Myrinet Quadrics IEEE 1355 and SpaceWire support source routing

In the Internet Protocol two header options are available which are rarely used strict source and record route SSRR and loose source and record route LSRR Because of security concerns packets marked LSRR are frequently blocked on the Internet If not blocked LSRR can allow an attacker to spoof its address but still successfully receive response packets

In IPv6 two forms of source routing have been developed The first approach was the Type 0 Routing header  This routing header was designed to support the same use cases as the IPv4 header options Unfortunately there were several important attacks against this routing header and its utilisation was deprecated A more secure form of source routing is being developed within the IETF to support the IPv6 version of Segment Routing

Softwaredefined networking can also be enhanced when source routing is used in the forwarding plane Studies have shown significant improvements in convergence times as a result of the reduced state that must be distributed by the controller into the network

When using source routing with Myrinet the sender of the packet prepends the complete route one byte for every crossbar to each packet header
Each crossbar examines the first routing byte of the packet
When using source routing that byte indicates a particular port of that crossbar when that port becomes available the router discards that routing byte and sends the rest of the packet out that port

Each packet traveling through a SpaceWire network can use path addressing source routing or logical addressing or some combination
The router examines the first data character of the packet when it indicates some specific port of the router the router discards that routing character and sends the rest of the packet out that port

Sauce Amricaine
Sauce amricaine is a recipe from classic French cookery containing chopped onions tomatoes white wine brandy salt cayenne pepper butter and fish stock It is sometimes known as sauce armoricaine which is the original name derived from Armorica the ancient name for a region of France including Brittany which is known for its fishing

Louis Saulnier gives the following recipe

Amricaine  Treat as for Lobster Amricaine Pound shells and meat in the mortar and incorporate equal quantity of fish velout add butter

As with many other classic dishes the original recipe has been adapted over time and almost every chef will prepare the sauce in a slightly different way Modern recipes usually include tarragon will use lobster stock rather than pounded lobster and often replace cayenne pepper with paprika

SaturnShuttle
The SaturnShuttle was a preliminary concept of launching the Space Shuttle orbiter using the Saturn V rocket It was studied and considered in 19711972

An interstage would be fitted on top of the SIC stage to support the external tank in the space occupied by the SII stage in the Saturn V It was an alternative to the SRBs

The addition of wings and some form of landing gear on the SIC stage would allow the booster to fly back to the Kennedy Space Center where technicians would then refurbish the booster by replacing only the five F1 engines and reusing the tanks and other hardware for later flights

The Shuttle would handle space station logistics while Saturn V would launch components 
This would have allowed a space station using a Skylab or Mir configuration with docking ports to have been lifted with just a handful of launches The SaturnShuttle concept also would have eliminated the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters that ultimately precipitated the Space Shuttle Challenger accident in 1986

Because the shuttle orbiter would be riding piggyback on the external tank and the need to prevent damage to the delicate thermal protection tiles the fiveengine variant of the SaturnShuttle would require the center engine to be shut down 45 to 50 seconds after launch while two of the outboard engines would have to be shut down prior to staging Once the SIC was jettisoned the three onboard highenergy Space Shuttle main engines would then propel the orbiter into LEO shutting down 65 minutes after ignition The external tank would then be jettisoned as on the actually flown shuttle configuration and the orbiter would then perform its mission

But because of the need to keep costs down and to allow President Richard Nixon to approve the shuttle program in 1972 NASA decided to utilize segmented solid rocket boosters similar to those used on the Titan III rocket instead of the SIC thus ending the Saturn program after the initial Saturn V order was completed

In 1994 enrollment in the school outgrew the capacity of its facilities at Faith Presbyterian As a result the schools lower grades K4 remained at Faith and the higher grades 58 the highest grade offered at the time moved to facilities at Watkinsville First Baptist Church WCAs first high school class graduated in the spring of 1999

The school completed the first phase of development at its present location a site in Oconee County in the fall of 1998 An additional expansion has been planned that would add a new gymnasium and bring the schools capacity to 500 students

The school enrolled 270 students across all grades for the 20112012 academic year

WCAs facilities include an administration building which also houses the library a lowerschool building which houses PreK through fifth grade an upperschool building with a gymnasium and a fitness center which houses the middle grades and Westminster High School a field house containing two class rooms and three athletic fields The gymnasium houses ten classrooms

Uniforms are required on four out of five days for middle through high school on casual Friday students can wear nontorn jeans and Tshirts A chapel is held every Thursday at separate times for K5 and 612 where all students sing and listen to a guest speaker

WCA is accredited by the Georgia Accrediting Commission and has a dual accreditation with the Southern Association of Independent Schools and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools

Northgate Mall San Rafael
Northgate Mall is a shopping mall located in San Rafael California north of the Golden Gate Bridge Its the largest of three shopping centers in San Rafael called Northgate It is managed by The Macerich Company It is the only enclosed regional shopping center in Marin County The malls anchors are Macys and Kohls with a vacant anchor last occupied by Sears It also contains a Century Theatres multiplex a food court and more than 90 specialty stores services and restaurants

The original anchor in the corner occupied by Macys was The Emporium which opened in 1964 When the rest of the mall opened in 1965 it had an openair design The mall was enclosed when it was renovated in 1987

MTR Properties Inc was the original owner Macerich bought the mall in 1985 before selling it to Merlone Geier Partners in 2017

On January 4 2018 Sears announced that its store at the mall will be closing as part of a plan to close 103 stores nationwide The store closed in April 2018 Around the same time plans were announced that would transform the mall into a town center 

Macerich began renovating the mall in 2008 The proposed renovation has been controversial as housing advocates have pushed for inclusion of affordable housing in the project to replace the aging housing in the Canal Area while Macerich chose to proceed without triggering a fullscale environmental review

Relational dialectics
Relational dialectics is an interpersonal communication theory about close personal ties and relationships that highlights the tensions struggles and interplay between contrary tendencies The theory proposed respectively by Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery in 1988 defines communication patterns between relationship partners as the result of endemic dialectical tensions

Relationships are made in dialogue and they can be complicated and dialogue with similarities and differences are necessary Relational communication theories allow for opposing views or forces to come together in a reasonable way When making decisions desires and viewpoints that often contradict one another are mentioned and lead to dialectical tensions Leslie A Baxter and Barbara M Montgomery exemplify these contradictory statements that arise from individuals experience dialectal tensions using common proverbs such as opposites attract but birds of a feather flock together as well as twos company threes a crowd but the more the merrier This does not mean these opposing tensions are fundamentally troublesome for the relationship on the contrary they simply bring forward a discussion of the connection between two parties

The relational dialectic is an elaboration on Mikhail Bakhtins idea that life is an open monologue and humans experience collisions between opposing desires and needs within relational communications Baxter includes a list of dialectical tensions that reminds us that relationships are constantly changing and that successful and satisfying relationships require constant attention Although Baxters description of relational dialectics is thorough it is not exact or all inclusive since we all experience different tensions in different ways

Relational dialectics is the emotional and valuebased version of the philosophical dialectic It is rooted in the dynamism of the yin and yang Like the classic yin and yang the balance of emotional values in a relationship is constantly in motion and any value pushed to its extreme contains the seed of its opposite 

In the Western world the ideas of ying and yang link back to the Greek philosopher Heraclitus who argued that the world was in constant flux like fire with creative and destructive forces on both sides of every process Mikhail Bakhtin a Russian scholar most known for his work in dialogism applied Marxist dialectic to literary and rhetorical theory and criticism He illustrated the tensions that exists in the deep structure of all human experience For example he identified that the tension that exists between unity and difference Bakhtin conceived the human dialectic as two forces analogous to the physical forces centripetal emotional forces tending towards unity and centrifugal emotional forces tending towards divergence Like the Yin and Yang Bakhtins forces have no ultimate resolution

Baxter took the deep structural analysis of Bakhtin and applied it to communication theory She found a TBangha of axes where this dynamic tension operated Later authors have added other axes

There are three main approaches to relational dialectics monologic dualistic and dialectic br

The first approach monologic approach frames contradictions as eitheror demonstrating that the contradictions are mutually exclusive or opposite of each other For example an individual can either like hot or cold weather They may not like not a mix of the weather conditions Monologic approach means as we move closer to one concept we move further away from the other br

The second approach dualistic approach frames contradictions as two separate entities showing that they are unrelated in nature When studying a relationship and one individual in the relationship is evaluated exclusive of his or her interaction with their partner then this is an example of dualistic approach br

The third approach the dialectic approach contends that multiple points of view play off one another in every contradiction bothand When two people are in a relationship one can desire to be open in the relationship exposing certain parts of his or her life with the other person At the same time that individual can also have a sense of selfprotection where they may not want to share everything about them with their partner Both of these feelings can exist within the individual at the same time

There are four main concepts that form the backdrop of relational dialectics as well as four major assumptions Relational dialectics assumes that 1 relationships are not linear 2 relational life is characterized by change 3 contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life and 4 communication is central to organizing and negotiating relational contradictions

The four core concepts of relational dialectics include contradiction totality process and praxis

Contradictions are the core concept of relational dialectics It is the dynamic interplay between unified oppositions A contradiction is formed whenever two tendencies or forces are interdependent unity yet mutually negate one another negation For example in a relationship one can simultaneously desire intimacy and distance

Totality suggests that contradictions in a relationship are part of a unified whole and cannot be understood in isolation In other words the dialectics cannot be separated and are intrinsically related to each other For example the tension between dependence and interdependence cannot be separated from the tension between openness and privacy  both work to condition and define the other

Process Relational dialectics must be understood in terms of social processes Movement activity and change are functional properties Rawlins1989 For example instances such as an individual fluctuating between disclosure and secretiveness In addition the individual may move between periods of honest and open communication Miller 2002 2005 

Praxis is a philosophical term for the concept of practical behavior or sometimes the experience of practicing In praxis the dialectic tensions are created and recreated through the active participation and interaction In other words the practical experience of having a relationship exposes one to the imposition of the needs and values of another As the relationship endures ones own needs and values become apparent Praxis focuses on the practical choices individuals make in the midst of the opposing needs and values dialectical tensions In turn the choices and actions themselves create recreate and change the nature of the relationship and hence the dialectical tensions themselves

Research has recommended theories which further dialectical understanding in relationships such as in marriage in the workplace etc Relational dialectics further includes the idea of Contextual Dialectics or rather the idea that every relationship exists within a specific place within a specific culture From there we also see the raise of public and privatereal and ideal dialectics and the interplay between what is seen on television in public life versus what is experienced in private lives Examples of this concept include the viewing of politicians as well as what is viewed on television shows According to West and Turner the tension of the real and ideal dialectic is featured when we think of television shows like Leave It to Beaver We receive an idealized message of what family life is like and then when we look at the families we live in we have to contend with the troublesome realities of family life The tension between these two images forms this dialectic

According to the original relational dialectic model there were many core tensions opposing values in any relationship These are autonomy and connectedness favoritism and impartiality openness and closedness novelty and predictability instrumentality and affection and finally equality and inequality

Autonomy and connectedness refers to the desire to have ties and connections with others versus the need to separate oneself as a unique individual An example of autonomy and connectedness would be an athlete who wants to feel like heshe is a part of a team but also wanting to highlight hisher individual talents Favoritism and impartiality refers to the desire to be treated fairly and impartially versus the desire to be seen and known as special For instance a professor may want to be impartial by creating an attendance policy but makes exceptions for students who participate in class and have good grades demonstrating favoritism Openness and closedness refers to the desire to be open and divulge information versus the desire to be exclusive and private When chatting with a boss about ones weekend there is the desire to be open however closedness is also at play as certain details are often left out because of the context Novelty and predictability suggest that there is a desire for the relationship to be predictable versus the desire for it to be original and new When creating scheduled meetings for board members the predictability may lie in a fixed schedule however the novelty may be in scheduling a varying number of locations to peak interests as well as inspiration Instrumentality and affection is the desire for affection to be genuine versus the desire for affection to be motivated by benefits and perceived advantages of the relationship An example of this would be being in a romantic relationship based on love and affection but maintaining it for benefits such as financial security Finally equality and inequality refers to the desire to be considered as equals versus the desire to develop levels of superiority A female in the military may seek treatment equivalent to that received by her male colleagues but requires special barracks and adjusted assignments 

According to the theory while most of us may embrace the ideals of closeness certainty and openness in our relationships the communication is not a straight path towards these goals Conflicts often produce the exact opposites

The table above shows typical dialectical tensions experienced by relational partners based on research done by Baxter and Montgomery showing contrasting efforts in two different ways The column that displays examples of Internal Dialect shows ongoing tensions played out within a relationship The column that displays examples of External Dialect shows ongoing tensions between a couple and their community

Integrationseparation is a class of relational dialectics that includes connectionautonomy inclusionseclusion and intimacyindependence Some individual autonomy must be given up to connect to others

Stabilitychange is a class of relational dialectics that includes certaintyuncertainty conventionallyuniqueness predictabilitysurprise and routinenovelty Things must be consistent but not mundane There must be a balance between the expected and unexpected in order to keep a relationship

Expressionnonexpression is a class of relational dialectics that includes opennessclosedness revelationconcealment candorsecrecy and transparencyprivacy In a relationship it is important to keep some things between the two parties while other parts of the relationship are okay to allow the public to know about

According to Michaela Meyer relational dialectics theory exposes tensions within interpersonal relationships while at the same time it assumes a continual maintenance and repair of these tensions As a result relational dialectics theory is incredibly useful for defining how tensions are managed within relationships Extensive research has been done regarding the role dialectical tensions play in relationships as well as the various factors that influence the tensions and the degree to which they affect the relationship Through studies of romantic relationships long distance relationships friendships and family relationships researchers have observed the existence and frequency of certain dialectical tensions within various types of relationships

According to Marsha Linehan founder of DBT or Dialectical Behavior Therapy some people have great difficulty resolving the dialectic tensions that arise in relationships Many people with personality disorders potentially caused or made worse by dysfunctional upbringing especially Borderline Personality Disorder BPD and some others perpetually vascilate between the poles of the dialectic conflict with resulting instability causing problems in living that are not mediated by other therapy modalities In DBTs biosocial theory some people have a biological predisposition for emotional dysregulation and their social environment validates maladaptive behavior 

A study of 25 heterosexual married couples was designed to determine what types of dialectical tensions were most prevalent in antagonistic conflicts between spouses Larry Erbert found that the Openness v Closedness dialectic was most commonly referenced through examples by participants Research conducted by Baxter and Montgomery confirmed this finding and broke the dialectic down into four subcategories to further analyze its existence in romantic relationships


Research has been conducted to examine the autonomyconnection dialectic when dealing with termination of romantic relationships In Erin Sahlestein and Tim Duns study they found that participants joint conversations and their breakup accounts reflect the two basic forms of contradiction Both antagonistic and nonantagonistic struggles were evident in these data Furthermore the study discovered that while normally breakups are retroactively studied the autonomyconnection dialectic is actually in full swing throughout the termination process as opposed to previous thought of as a move from connection to autonomy

A study measuring the display of symbols by lesbian couples revealed that while samesex couples experience similar challenges that oppositesex partners experience there are unique challenges that arise to these samesex couples These unique problems in turn give rise to unique dialectical tensions within the relationship

In a study that focused on dialectics in second marriages six tensions unique to remarriages emerged

Three tensions related to the remarried dyad


Three tensions also emerged from the remarried dyad and their social networks


Based on research by Sahlstein the uncertainty v certainty dialectic is the most prevailing dialectic found in longdistance relationships Her work exposed uncertainty v certainty as a competing yet complementary need In interviews conducted with couples engaged in long distance relationships contradictions emerged For example couples were found to plan interactions in order to obtain a level of spontaneity Within this three different forms of the praxis of relational dialectics emerged

William Rawlins has examined the role of relational dialectics in regard to friendships The tension of instrumentality v affection was found to be the most central to this type of relationship Within friendships importance is placed on the ability to discern the level of affection for real friendships opposed to instrumentality for fake friendships Aristotles friendship of virtue notion of caring for friends without instrumental purposes exemplifies this point The dichotomy of instrumentality v affection cannot be ignored within friendships as affection may be offered in order to receive instrumental aid from friends This interweaving of concepts is what distinguishes different types of friendships While this remains true the subjectivity of the friends in question ultimately determines the outcome of how heavily instrumentality v affection is applied

In the workplace

Blended Relationships are close friends that are a part of the same work environment Dialectical tensions occur in organizations as individuals attempt to balance their roles as employees while maintaining established friendships within their occupations It is not necessary however to have a friend in organizations to experience dialectical contradictions Stress occurs frequently on the individual level as human needs and desires oppose
 Sibling relationships 

Relational dialectics can be applied when considering the significant change in family life that siblings experience when one sibling moves out of the family home for the first time as part of the transition into adulthood As one sibling begins a new phase of life this change is often accompanied by new friendships or romantic relationships that occur in hisher new lifestyle along with a new geographic separation both of which result in a change in communication As the newly absent sibling begins a new lifestyle beyond hisher home the preexisting sibling relationship goes through various changes and transitions

In a study conducted on discursive struggles among siblings experiencing transition all participants acknowledged that moving away from their siblings resulted in a discursive struggle between the old and new meanings in the sibling relationship Two specific discursive struggles were identified

While participants addressed the varying tensions involved with lifestyle transitions 8 of the 19 participants in the study expressed that moving away from their sibling strengthened their connection and appreciation for their brothers andor sisters

In a study focusing on the adult stepchild perceptions of communication in the stepchildstepparent relationship three contradictions were found to be experienced by the stepchildren participants

In another study researchers aimed to identify the contradictions that were perceived by stepchildren when characterizing the ways that familial interactions caused them to feel caught in the middle between parents The participants expressed that they wanted to be centered in the family while at the same time they hoped to avoid being caught in the middle of two opposing parents The main contradiction identified in the study was similar to the autonomyconnection dialectic stepchildren desired the freedom to communicate and enact the desired relationship with their parents However these stepchildren also felt the need to manage the constraints that resulted from parental communication particularly when both parents did not cooperate with one another While the stepchildren wanted to know what was happening at the same time they also wanted to be protected resulting in a second dialectic of controlrestraint Through this study the researchers believe that opennesscloseness dialectic between parents and their children is important to building functional stepfamily relationships

One study focused on the relationship and communication between collegeaged stepchildren and their nonresidential parents found two underlying contradictions parenting and not parenting and openness and closeness Many participants expressed that they wanted their nonresidential parent to be actively involved in parenting them but did not desire it once they were Participants also expressed that while they wanted open and intimate communication with their nonresidential parents they felt that they could not closely communicate because of the nonresidential parents lack of familiarity with the childs everyday life

Relational dialectics theory can be applied to the context of health care specifically endoflife care providing a system for caregiver communication that contains tensions and challenges The quality of the endoflife journey is influenced by how these tensions are managed Relational dialectics theory is an applicable framework for investigating the ongoing communication between physicians and their patientsfamily members during the process of endoflife care

When making choices about endoflife medical care family members friends or surrogate decision makers often experience feelings of tension and burden Decisionmakers must deal with the relational and moral tensions that come with such decisionmaking Family members in charge of making endoflife decisions often face conflicting emotions between holding on and letting go recognizing the need to let a patient go while wanting to continue fighting to keep a loved one alive

In a study that focused on the communication tensions perceived among the Maori culture during the endoflife journey it was found that despite the cultures focus on collectivism and its emphasis on harmony four communication tensions existed between caregivers family and friends and patients autonomy and connection conflict and connection isolation and connection and balancing the needs of self and other

The human grieving process is marked by relational dialectics After the death of a child bereaved parents often experience tension between presence and absence by grieving their childs permanent absence while still experiencing an emotional bond toward the deceased child Bereaved parents may also experience tension between openness and closeness where they desire to discuss their feelings with friends or family yet they are hesitant to share because of the potentially negative reactions they could receive

One study aimed at focusing on how families make sense of contradictory discourses found two discursive contradictions family members wishes vs patients wishes and emotionality vs rationality Through interviews with participants who had experienced the loss of a loved one researchers concluded that many of the end of life decisions made by family members patients and doctors were centered on making sense of the simultaneous desires to hold on and to let go Participants recognized that they experienced tension between their own preferences and the preferences of a loved one and with that experienced the tension between desiring to make decisions based on emotions versus making decisions based on rationality

Dialectical contradictions have also been found among parents who have lost a child One study found that two primary dialectical contradictions occurred for parents who had experienced the death of a child opennesscloseness and presenceabsence Parents experienced opennesscloseness when they desired to talk about their child and their loss yet they perceived the outcome as risky especially if they sensed that friends and family wished for the parents to move on Participants explained that they were able to manage this contradiction by being selective with their disclosure and taking control over the communicative situation When dealing with the presenceabsence dialectic bereaved parents experienced tensions between the ongoing bond that they experienced with their child and the physical absence of the child Participants expressed that when people were not willing to remember their dead child the physical absence of the child was deeply felt However when people chose to remember the deceased child the parent experienced feelings of comfort and continual bonding with the child

Understanding Autistic Communication

As relational dialects aim is to analyse competence during interaction it can suggest an approach to researching on communication competence among people which are with autism spectrum disorders Applying relational dialects theory to studying interactions of autistic individuals starts from approaching autistic individual as an actor during the interaction and deeming competence a result of the interaction This approach can delve into how social contexts expectations and roles contribute to the autistics competent communication The investigation of dialects includes integrationseparation expressionprivacy and stabilitychange enhance the understanding of the communication between people with autism spectrum disorders

Dialogue is typically a conversation between two or more people These conversations are what constitute relationships as communication is the very foundation of any relationship According to Cools the four important concepts that form the foundation of dialogism 1 the self and the other situated in contradictory forces 2 unfinalizability 3 the chronotope and the carnivalesque and 4 heteroglossia and utterance Similarity in dialogue the following components are the most important constitutive dialogue utterance chains dialectical flux aesthetic moment and critical sensibility

Constitutive dialogue

While some theorists along with Baxter may argue that communication is simply a feature in a relationship examining constitutive dialogue suggests that communication is actually what creates and maintains a relationship instead According to Baxter a constitutive approach to communication asks how communication defines or constructs the social world including our selves and our personal relationships From a constitutive perspective then persons and relationships are not analytically separable from communication instead communication constitutes these phenomena When initial researchers studied relationships they found that similarities backgrounds and interests are usually what hold people together while selfdisclosure is the root of these components Dialogic researchers would argue that differences are just as important as similarities and they are both discovered through dialogue

Utterance chains

To understand utterance chains we must know that an utterance is what a person says in one turn of a conversation When utterances are linked to competing discourses they are considered utterance chains Baxter believes that there are four links on the chain where the struggle of competing discourses can be heard These are cultural ideologies relational history nonyet spoken response of partner or utterance and normative evaluation of third party to utterance Baxter also suggest that to understand an utterance we must also understand the discourse She posits in the broadest sense a discourse is a cultural system of meaning that circulates among a groups members and which makes our talk sensical for example in the United States the discourse of individualism helps us to understand and value an utterance such as I need to find myself first before I commit to a serious relationship with another person

Dialectical flux

A dialectical flux is the unpredictable unfinalizable indeterminate nature of personal relationships Relationships are complicated and intertwined with dialectical tensions Spiraling inversion and segmentation are two strategies that Baxter and Montgomery have established to respond to this complexity Spiraling inversion is generally a nowin situation a struggle between two different thought processes For example if you were to do something your parents did not approve of you could lie about it but your parents might yell at you for lying And on the other hand you could tell them upfront and they could be completely quiet in shock Segmentation is pertaining to more than one role in a relationship that must be altered depending on the situation For example if you were working at your fathers shop as a parttime job he would be considered your father AND your boss This could mean that he has different expectations of you in different circumstances and his attitude towards you might change between roles

Aesthetic moment

Aesthetic moments are brief incidents in a relationship that bring participants together through the use of dialogue There is a temporary feeling of wholeness felt between partners involved in this dialogue It is easy to see examples of aesthetic moments in romantic relationships such as a first kiss or a reciting of wedding vows but these moments can be experienced by anyone

Critical sensibility

According to Griffin critical sensibility is an obligation to critique dominant voices especially those that suppress opposing viewpoints a responsibility to advocate for those who are muted This means that both sides of a dialogue are equal to one another No one person is more powerful or dominant than the other and they are able to communicate without these imbalances interfering This does not mean that the dialogue is free of competing discourses as listed in Utterance Chains

When communicating we must understand that morals do not apply for all people Sometimes lying can be entirely minor in communication but there are oftentimes that lying can majorly affect the perspective of those being lied to There are several times where most people would justify a white lie or a lie that causes no harm For instance if your mother was in the hospital you could tell her she still looked beautiful even if her appearance was far from it because it would make her feel better Other actions that are only followed through based on whether they have a positive or negative outcome are called consequential ethics According to Sissela Bok lies drag around an initial negative weight that must be factored into ethical equations Bok believes in the principle of veracity which says that truthful statements are preferable to lies in the absence of special circumstances that overcome the negative weight Ethics plays a major role in the study of interpersonal communication particularly relational dialectics In an area where contradictions seem like the norm it is even more important to share the truth Incorporating varying and often times opposite view points is critical because communication is grounded in human nature which forces ethics

According to theorist Leslie Baxter there are three major limitations in the work of relational dialectics theory Baxter claims that her work has been too distanced from naturally occurring talk between relating parties and claims that the theory needs a firmer empirical base when applied to talk between relating parties Naturally occurring talk between relating parties could be qualitative work utilizing the observation method of relating parties or small groups Nonparticipative or participative observation would be appropriate for continued study of relational dialectics theory Baxter also believes that more future work needs to include multiple voices instead of focusing on the more popular research on the dialectics between two voices Baxter posits that relational dialectics opposite infers binary opposites when many discourses can be competing at once Lastly Baxter shares that future research should focus on discourse through time such as studying dialogue and how it transforms over a longer period of time The latter would take significant time so it would be studies that incorporate earlier works compared to more recent work

WVAR first went on the air on DeleteWord 16 1957 and first broadcast at 1280 AM under the call letters WMNF The original owner was Royal Broadcasting Company of which Herman Dotson served as president and Art Grunewald as general manager Studios were located along Cemetery Road in Richwood By 1959 the call letters were changed to WVAR as they remain today

On January 1 1965 WVAR was sold to R  S Broadcasting Carl Gainer was the new company president and Virgil Graves became General Manager In 1968 WVAR moved from its dial position of 1280kHz to 600kHz The station retained its daytimeonly broadcast hours and output power of 1000 watts

In 1991 WVAR moved its studios and offices to 713 Main Street in Summersville but would maintain a local presence in Richwood at 2 Rhododendron Drive formerly known as Cemetery Road On December 24 1996 after more than 30 years of ownership WVAR was sold by R  S Broadcasting to J  K Broadcasting The ownership change also resulted in the pairing of an FM sister station WAFD which had gone on the air earlier that year with a southern and country gospel format

In midFebruary 2003 an ice storm that ravaged the southern part of West Virginia toppled the WVAR broadcasting antenna atop Hinkle Mountain which overlooks Richwood In the following summer the station and its owner raised funds to erect a new antenna The station was closed with a dark license while funds were sought to replace it

On March 13 2007 J  K Broadcasting Inc sold WVAR to Summit Media Broadcasting LLC for 124 million in a transaction that included sister FM station WAFD in Webster Springs Summit Media also owns WDBSFM and WSGBAM Studios were moved to 202 Back Fork Street in Webster Springs

On May 15 2007 WVAR dropped its country format and began simulcasting sister WSGBAMs oldies format as The Mighty 1490 That October Summit Media filed an application with the FCC to waive main studio requirements for WVAR which would allow onair operations to be colocated with WSGB and other stations in Summit Medias ownership group

Two months later another application was filed informing the FCC that Summit Media had taken the station silent due to Summit Medias inability to successfully meet FCCrequired staffing needs at the Webster Springs studio The FCC granted the application to keep the station silent in January 2008 until granting permission for the studio waiver later that year However Summit Media kept the station silent for another year due to technical renovations being delayed due to the lack of available workforce

In November 2009 Summit Media filed an application to rebroadcast WVARs signal over FM translator W251AY licensed to Birch River The translator licensed to operate at 981 mHz broadcasts at 250 watts at a height of 256 m above average terrain The translator which has been on the air since 2004 had been previously used to rebroadcast the signal of sister FM station WDBS

Oboe Concerto Marcello
The Oboe Concerto in Dminor SD935 is an early 18thcentury concerto for oboe strings and continuo attributed to the Venetian composer Alessandro Marcello The earliest extant manuscript containing Johann Sebastian Bachs solo keyboard arrangement of the concerto BWV974 dates from around 1715 As a concerto for oboe strings and continuo its oldest extant sources date from 1717 that year it was printed in Amsterdam and a Cminor variant of the concerto SZ799 was written down

Bachs keyboard version was published as an arrangement of a concerto by Antonio Vivaldi in the 19th century In 1923 the Cminor version of the oboe concerto was published as a composition by Benedetto Marcello Alessandros brother In the second half of the 20th century several publications indicated Alessandro again as the composer of the piece as it had been in its early 18thcentury print and the oboe concerto was again published in its Dminor version

As well oboe concerto versions and versions based on Bachs arrangement kept repertoire in the 20th and 21st century

The Concerto in Dminor SD935 was published by Jeanne Roger in Amsterdam in 1717 as a Concerto a Cinque concerto in five parts for oboe soloist strings two violin and one viola parts and continuo composed by Alessandro Marcello No publication date appears in the print although the year of publication is depending on author sometimes given as ca 17141717 or 1716 it can be inferred from the consecutive testaments of the publishers father Estienne Roger and from the sequence of publication numbers The publication presents the melody lines unadorned that is it is left to the performing musician to embellish melodies with ornaments such as trills mordents and grace notes Alessandro Marcello published most of his works under a pseudonym Eterio Stinfalico the oboe concerto publication was an exception in that sense as it used his real name

In his Weimar period 170817 Johann Sebastian Bach arranged several concertos by Venetian composers most of them by Antonio Vivaldi for solo keyboard In July 1713 Prince Johann Ernst returned to Weimar from the Netherlands with several compositions by Italian masters Vivaldis Op3 Lestro Armonico had been published in Amsterdam in 1711 and there is little doubt that the Prince brought this edition containing twelve concertos to Weimar in 1713 as Bach apparently used this print for five of his solo keyboard arrangements The Prince who also composed Italianate concertos presumably encouraged Bach to produce solo keyboard arrangements of such works As the Prince left Weimar in July 1714 it is estimated that most of Bachs solo keyboard arrangements of Italian and Italianate concertos originated in the period from July 1713 to July 1714 That is at least those arrangements that could be performed on a harpsichord without pedalboard while the Weimar court organ which would be needed for arrangements including pedals such as BWV 592597 would have been unavailable for undergoing repairs in this period

Bachs manualiter arrangement BWV974 of the Marcello concerto was apparently not based on the Amsterdam edition but must have been based on a lost manuscript version of the concerto that circulated before it was printed The July 1713 to July 1714 timeframe may fit for the production of the arrangement of this concerto although an earlier or later date is possible too Bachs autograph of the solo keyboard arrangement is lost but the arrangement was copied around 1715 by Bachs second cousin Johann Bernhard as the third item in a manuscript containing 12 of Johann Sebastians keyboard transcriptions of Italian and Italianate concertos In 1739 Johann Bernhards son Johann Ernst wrote a title page for this collection suggesting that the collection contained Vivaldi arrangements for organ exclusively He may have intended this title page for the first concerto in the collection only which was indeed an arrangement of a Vivaldi concerto but an unknown hand later added the number XII before the title thus causing the misunderstanding that all 12 were Vivaldi arrangements Another copy of Bachs arrangement indicates Marcello without first name as the composer of the original work and JS Bach as the arranger That copy specifying harpsichord as the intended instrument for the arrangement originated after Johann Bernhards but may have been copied from an earlier stage of Bachs arrangement Another manuscript containing Bachs arrangement of Marcellos oboe concerto indicated JSB as composer on the title page without mentioning an earlier model or its composer for the composition

The ornamentation as indicated in Bachs keyboard version of the concerto works well on harpsichord but is less suitable for performance on an early 18thcentury oboe Nonetheless Bachs ornamentation has been used for 20thcentury publications of the oboe concerto  the ornamentation causes fewer problems when performed on a modern oboe Editions of the Dminor version of the oboe concerto with an ornamentation which is better in line with the possibilities of a baroque oboe have been proposed since the late 20th century

Another transcription of the concerto as concerto a 5 for oboe strings and continuo in Cminor is found in a 1717 manuscript The type of errors in this manuscript seems to suggest that the transposition from Dminor to Cminor may have been produced by its scribes while copying This manuscript writes the composers name as Marcello without specifying a first name as Alessandros brother Benedetto was far better known as a composer by the name Marcello later generations would interpret the title of the manuscript as referring to the better known of the Marcello composers

The piece has three movements

The concerto survives in different printed and manuscript versions one of these in C minor

The concerto has also been recorded played on a piccolo trumpet  a notoriously challenging transcription due to the breath control and tight embouchure required for its sustained passages in the higher register

FrankTamm formula
The FrankTamm formula yields the amount of Cherenkov radiation emitted on a given frequency as a charged particle moves through a medium at superluminal velocity It is named for Russian physicists Ilya Frank and Igor Tamm who developed the theory of the Cherenkov effect in 1937 for which they were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958

When a charged particle moves faster than the phase speed of light in a medium electrons interacting with the particle can emit coherent photons while conserving energy and momentum This process can be viewed as a decay See Cherenkov radiation and nonradiation condition for an explanation of this effect

The energy formula1 emitted per unit length travelled by the particle per unit of frequency formula2 is

provided that formula4 Here formula5 and formula6 are the frequencydependent permeability and index of refraction of the medium respectively formula7 is the electric charge of the particle formula8 is the speed of the particle and formula9 is the speed of light in vacuum

Cherenkov radiation does not have characteristic spectral peaks as typical for fluorescence or emission spectra The relative intensity of one frequency is approximately proportional to the frequency That is higher frequencies shorter wavelengths are more intense in Cherenkov radiation This is why visible Cherenkov radiation is observed to be brilliant blue In fact most Cherenkov radiation is in the ultraviolet spectrum the sensitivity of the human eye peaks at green and is very low in the violet portion of the spectrum

The total amount of energy radiated per unit length is

This integral is done over the frequencies formula11 for which the particles speed formula8 is greater than speed of light of the media formula13 The integral is convergent finite because at high frequencies the refractive index becomes less than unity and for extremely high frequencies it becomes unity

Consider a charged particle moving relativistically along formula14axis in a medium with refraction index formula15 with a constant velocity formula16 Start with Maxwells equations in Gaussian units in the wave form and take the Fourier transformation

formula17

formula18

For a charge moving with velocity formula8 the density and charge density can be expressed as formula20 and formula21 taking the Fourier transformation gives

formula22 

formula23

Substituting this density and charge current into the wave equation we can solve for the Fourierform potentials

formula24 and formula25

Using the definition of the electromagnetic fields in terms of potentials we then have the Fourierform of the electric and magnetic field

formula26 and formula27

To find the radiated energy we consider electric field as a function of frequency at some perpendicular distance from the particle trajectory say at formula28 where formula29 is the impact parameter It is given by the inverse Fourier transform

formula30

First we compute formula14component formula32 of the electric field parallel to formula33

formula34

For brevity we define formula35 Breaking the integral apart into formula36 the formula37 integral can immediately be integrated by the definition of the Dirac Delta

formula38

The integral over formula39 has the value formula40 giving

formula41

The last integral over formula42 is in the form of a modified Macdonald Bessel function giving the evaluated parallel component in the form

formula43

One can follow a similar pattern of calculation for the other fields components arriving at

formula44 and formula45

We can now consider the radiated energy formula1 per particle traversed distance formula47 It can be expressed through the electromagnetic energy flow formula48 through the surface of an infinite cylinder of radius formula49 around the path of the moving particle which is given by the integral of the Poynting vector formula50 over the cylinder surface

formula51

The integral over formula52 at one instant of time is equal to the integral at one point over all time Using formula53

formula54

Converting this to the frequency domain

formula55

To go into the domain of Cherenkov radiation we now consider perpendicular distance formula29 much greater than atomic distances in a medium that is formula57 With this assumption we can expand the Bessel functions into their asymptotic form

formula58

formula59 and formula60

Thus

formula61

If formula62 has a positive real part usually true the exponential will cause the expression to vanish rapidly at large distances meaning all the energy is deposited near the path However this isnt true when formula63 is purely imaginary  this instead causes the exponential to become 1 and then is independent of formula49 meaning some of the energy escapes to infinity as radiation  this is Cherenkov radiation

formula63 is purely imaginary if formula66 is real and formula67 That is when formula66 is real Cherenkov radiation has the condition that formula69 This is the statement that the speed of the particle much be larger than the phase velocity of electromagnetic fields in the medium at frequency formula11 in order to have Cherenkov radiation With this purely imaginary formula63 condition formula72 and the integral can be simplified to

formula73

This is the FrankTamm equation in Gaussian units This derivation follows Jackson 3rd Edition

Hughes v Lord Advocate
The cases main significance is that after the shift within the common law of negligence from strict liability to a reasonable standard of care this case advocated a middle way namely 
This idea was neither developed nor expanded upon and only one year later the claimant in Doughty v Turner Manufacturing obtained no remedy via this middle way However the case was followed in subsequent cases on occupiers liability

One evening in November CsedTestWord two boys aged 8 and 10 were walking down Russell Road Edinburgh where some Post Office workers were repairing cables under the street The men had opened a manhole and had erected a weather tent over it with an access ladder inside From midafternoon onwards the tent had four red paraffin warning lamps The workmen left around 5pm for a tea break nearby before leaving they withdrew the ladder leaving it outside the tent

While the workmen were out the boys arrived and started meddling with the equipment They picked up one of the lamps and entered the tent They took the ladder and proceeded to explore the manhole after which they safely climbed out again The younger boy tripped over the lamp which fell into the manhole and broke The paraffin leaked and vaporised causing an explosion with flames reaching up to thirty feet The impact of the blast caused the 8year old to fall into the hole and suffer severe burn injuries

The question arose whether the Post Office workers had been negligent in leaving the site unattended with the lamps burning Under Scots law they owed a duty of reasonable care to prevent the site becoming an allurement for the boys had they discharged this duty On the other hand the children were trespasser and possibly contributorily negligence A crucial issue was the likelihood or foreseeability of the presence of children on Russell Road and whether the explosion causing the serious burn injuries was of different type than that could have been foreseeable

The court of first instance the First Division of the Court of Session limited the liability of the Post Office on the grounds that although the danger to children was foreseeable the accident itself was not foreseeable The defence had argued that the boys were not only trespassers but also contributorily negligeny but the court responded that the Post Office did not have any exclusive interest in the middle of the road to support a claim of trespass and taking into consideration the youth of the boy it was agreed that he was NOT contributorily negligence and these points were dropped on appeal to the House of Lords

Lord Jenkins addressed the duty of issue of care established by Lord Atkin in Donoghue v Stevenson saying the Post Office had brought on the public highway apparatus capable of constituting a source of danger to passerby  It was therefore their duty that such passerby neighbour in the language of Donoghue v Stevenson were so far as reasonably practicable protected from the various obstacles or allurements which the workmen had brought to the site It is clear that the safety precautions taken by the Post Office did not in this instance measure up to Lord Atkins test

Lord Morris stated that exercising an ordinary and certainly not an overexacting degree of prevention the workmen should have decided when the teabreak came that someone had better be left in charge who could repel the intrusion of inquisitive children thereby casting doubt that the workers had discharged their duty of care

In both the First Division and in the House of Lords the defence argued that it was unforeseeable that children might be on Russell Road a quiet road some four hundred yards away from any houses Lord Morris opined following the judgement of Lord Ordinary that if of course there was no likelihood that children might appear different considerations would apply But children did appear and I find no reason to differ from the conclusion of the Lord Ordinary that the presence of children in the immediate vicinity of the shelter was reasonably to be anticipated

Lord Guest declared that the burden of proof that the presence of children lay with the respondent and on the facts there was insufficient evidence to do this Lord Guest accepted that it was reasonable to anticipate the danger that might arise by meddling children and that that  the normal dangers of such children falling into the manhole and injured by a lamp were such that a reasonable man would not have ignored them

It was accepted that the explosion causing the burns was a result of paraffin leaking from the lamp According to Lord Reid the boys injuries from burns was foreseeable Although the extent of the injury of burn was greater than might have been expected this was no defence However if the injury were of a different kind than the foreseeable type the defender might have escaped liability

Lord Reid continued that as the cause of the accident  the explosion from paraffin lamp  was known it left no scope to allege the accident was caused from some unknown source rather than the fault of respondent Lord Reid concluded that the accident in question was but a variant of foreseeable and it mattered not it may have arisen in an unforeseeable manner

Lord Jenkins agreed finding no justification to hold someone liable if the accident had occurred from the burning of lamp but not if the lamp had exploded

Lord Morris agreed saying that the injury suffered by the boy was of a higher degree but was of the kind or type of accident which was foreseeable He said the respondent should not escape liability just because they could not foresee the exact way in which the boy might play with the equipment or the way in which he might get hurt Allowing the appeal Lord Morris said there was a duty owed by the respondent to safeguard the boy against the type or kind of occurrence which in fact happened and which resulted in his injuries and the defenders are not absolved from liability because they didnt envisage the precise concatenation of circumstances which lead up to the accident

Lord Guest pointed out that for making a coherent chain of causation it is not necessary to follow the minute details leading up to the accident to be reasonably foreseeable but only that the type of accident caused was of a foreseeable type He was of the view that the lower courts wrongly gave more emphasis on the fact on explosion to Lord Guest it was a nonessential element He gave more emphasis on the fact whether burning of paraffin outside the lamp was a reasonable foreseeable event The lower courts had already concluded these events as a reasonable foreseeable event but they were of the view the explosion was an unforeseeable event Lord Guest argued this as a fallacious claim Lord Guest concluded that the accident and the injuries sustained by the boys should have been reasonably foreseen by Post Office employees who were in breach of duty to take adequate protection against the accident

Lord Pearce cited the case of The Wagon Mound which held that a person is not liable if the accident is of a different type than the type which was foreseen by the person It would be unjust to check each and every details of the foreseeability test too minutely when the case deals with things that can be allurement to children leads to an accident and hard to foresee the exact way in which the accident may take place

In sum all the judges allowed the boys appeal The decision was followed in Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council

For a similar case arising under US law see Palsgraf v Long Island Railroad a case which had been influential upon the court in Donoghue v Stevenson

TalaMaddale
TalaMaddale is an ancient form of performance dialogue or debate performance in Southern India in the coastal Malnad regions of Karnataka and Kerala The plot and content of the conversation is drawn from popular mythology but the performance mainly consists of an impromptu debate between characters involving sarcasm puns philosophy positions and humour The main plot is sung from the same oral texts used for the yakshgana form of dance drama Performers claim that this was a more intellectual rendition of the dance during the monsoon season

The art form is popular in Uttara Kannada Dakshina Kannada Udupi and Shimoga districts of Karnataka and Kasaragod district of Kerala It is a derived form of Yakshaganaa classical dance or musical form of art from the same region

A typical TalaMaddale show consists of veteran artists sitting in a circular fashion along with a Bhagavata the singer with Tala or pair of small hand cymbals and a Maddale a type of drum player Artists play the roles of characters in stories typically from Ramayana Mahabharata and other puranas Some consider the as a good presentation of oratorial skills

Artists are normally well versed with the Hindu epics and puranas Kannada language is the normal medium of communication TalaMaddale performances are mostly held during the night the traditional reason being that in ancient times people finished their work by this time and assembled in temples to watch Tala Maddale It is organized by either hobbyists who are interested in the art at their houses or as a public event in villages and towns

As is common in many Indian art forms A Tala Maddale performance is commenced with a puja to Lord Ganesh the Hindu God of knowledge learning and art with a prayer song by Bhagavatha Usually this song is Gajamukhadavage ganapage This tends to be followed by a combination of pre scripted as well as ex tempore debates between the artists Hence while the average length of a performance is about three hours it can extend depending upon the debate Due to the latter artists are expected to be well versed with the subject matter too In ancient times TalaMaddale performances often took the form of allnight performances from 7 pm right up to 6 am

Subjects of Tala Maddale performances normally focus on episodes from the Hindu epics of Bhagavata and Puranas However episodes have also been created on other more current issues some of which include the Second World War the Tashkent Agreement the Indian freedom struggle Swarajya Vijaya and computerisation Ganakasura Kalaga

Some of the popular Tala maddale artists are Sheni Gopala Krishna Bhat Kerekai Krishna Bhat Kerekai Umakant Bhat Polali Shankaranarayana Shastri Shankaranarayana Samaga Matti Subba Rao Vasudeva Samaga Prabhakara Joshi MV Hegde Kumble Sundar Rao ML Samaga Padekallu Vishnu Bhat Sadashiva Alva Talapady Appu Nayak Athrady Ramana Acharya and Prashanth Belur Artha vaibhava or the grandeur of dialogues tends to be a highlight of these performances relished by the rasikas audience

In August 2016 the story of the Indian Freedom Struggle Swarajya Vijaya was enacted in Tala Maddale in the outer yard of the Sri Ananteshwara Temple at Rajangana Karnataka The episode prasanga had been written by MV Hegde A similar Tala Maddale performance related to the Indian freedom struggle had been held at this very place on 14 August 1947 when India achieved freedom from British Colonial powers

Tom Hickathrift
Tom Hickathrift or sometimes Jack Hickathrift is a legendary figure of East Anglian English folklore  a character similar to Jack the Giant Killer He famously battled a giant and is sometimes said to be a giant himself though normally he is just represented as possessing giantlike strength

Various stories of his exploits have grown up In one version he is fabled to have been a simple labourer at the time of the Norman Conquest and to have killed a giant in the marsh at Tilney Norfolk armed only with an axletree stuck into a cartwheel When his makeshift weapon broke he grabbed a lusty rawboned miller and used him as a weapon instead This exploit earned him the governorship of Thanet At the church in Walpole St Peter there is a dent in the ground where it is said a cannonball landed after he threw it to scare away the devil in this version Tom is a giant

In the fairy tale as told by Joseph Jacobs Tom lived in marsh of the Isle of Ely and although initially lazy and gluttonous he was prodigiously tall and it soon became apparent that he had the strength of twenty men Various proofs of his strength are given he carried twenty hundredweight of straw and a tree as if they weighed nothing kicked a football so far that nobody could find it and turned the tables on four men who tried to rob him He eventually got a job carting beer in Wisbech but the long journey tired him so one day he cut across the land of the Wisbech Giant The giant took this badly and fetched his club to beat Tom but at this point Tom took the axletree and cartwheel and fought the giant After a furious battle the giant was killed Tom took his land and was from then on held in esteem by the people of the area

Jacobs cites his source as the chapbook in the Pepysian Library from around 1660 edited by G L Gomme Gommes introduction states that there was evidence that an axletree and cartwheel had figured on a stone tomb in Tilney churchyard and local accounts associated these with a man named Hickifric who had withstood the tyranny of the lord of the manor

It has been suggested that he echoes the Norse god Thor AngloSaxon unor they were both known for fighting giants ate prodigiously and used a hammerlike weapon there is even a suggestion that the miller and Thors hammer Mjolnir come from the same source

He is mentioned in Laurence Sternes Tristram Shandy and Lavengro by George Borrow although Borrow places his exploits as far north as Lincolnshire The elaborate moulded plasterwork pargeting decorating the Old Sun Inn in Saffron Walden Essex features his battle against the Wisbech Giant

A character named Hiccafrith based on Tom appears in Marcus Pitcaithlys Hereward trilogy

Washington Memorial Chapel
Washington Memorial Chapel  located on Pennsylvania Route 23 in Valley Forge National Historical Park  is both a national memorial dedicated to General George Washington and an active Episcopal parish in Valley Forge Pennsylvania The church was inspired by a sermon preached by Anglican ministerReverend Dr W Herbert Burk founder and first rector of the parish The building was designed by architect Milton B Medary It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 1 2017 and is undergoing an active restoration campaign

Reverend Burk was rector of an Episcopal church in nearby Norristown The money for the chapel was raised in small increments nickels and dimes and its stone walls were built a few feet at a time In the religious and patriotic zeal of the day Dr Burk was active in trying to preserve Valley Forge and in the establishment of the Valley Forge Museum of American History the predecessor to the Valley Forge Historical Society

A previous attempt to build a memorial church at Valley Forge had been launched in 1885 by Baptist minister James M Guthrie who raised funds and began building before running out of funds

On June 19 1903 the 125th anniversary of the evacuation of the Continental Army from Valley Forge the cornerstone was laid on property donated by the I Heston Todd family A small woodframed building nearby preceded the present structure Following President Theodore Roosevelts visit to the site and address in 1904 the original wooden building was named the Theodore Roosevelt Chapel It was demolished after completion of the present chapel

The Chapels exterior was completed in 1917 and its interior in 1921 It serves as a wayside chapel to those who visit Valley Forge National Historical Park and is open to the public

Noted ironsmith Samuel Yellin produced the wrought iron gates hardware and locks He was one of many artisans to produce sculptures stonework stained glass and metal work The interior woodwork was supplied by BelgianAmerican cabinetmaker Edward Maene 18521931

From the visitors perspective the Chapel with its central location can appear to be a part of the park However the Chapel and surrounding property belong to the Episcopal Church Across Valley Forge Park Road formerly Port Kennedy Road standing opposite from the Chapel is the builders model of the Washington Monument This obelisk marks the grave of Lieutenant John Waterman The original Waterman gravestone had been on display in the visitors center museum The Bell Tower houses the DAR Patriot Rolls listing those that served in the Revolutionary War and the Chapel grounds hosted the World of Scouting Museum until ca 2013

The National Patriots Bell Tower was a later addition to the Chapel and houses its carillon The tower was built entirely with funds raised by members of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution DAR over a period of more than a decade Construction began in 1941 but was suspended due to World War II and restarted in 1949 The bell tower was completed and dedicated in 1953

The Justice Bell Womens Liberty Bell is on permanent display in the bell tower chamber It was forged in 1915 as a nearly identical replica of the Liberty Bell and became an instrumental symbol of the Womens Suffrage movement In 1920 after touring many parts of the country to promote the passing of the 19 Amendment the bell was stored on the grounds of Valley Forge National Park before being permanently moved to the bell tower chamber in 1943

The bell tower contains a traditional carillon with a keyboard of 58 bells The first 14 bells from the Meneely Bell Foundry were installed in a temporary wooden tower in 1926 and the number of bells expanded over the course of three decades Fiftysix bells were installed in the bell tower in 1953 and expanded to 58 bells in 1963 with two bells from the Fonderie Paccard in France

The bell tower is played regularly by a resident carilloneur Concerts both formal and informal are held throughout the year and are open to the public

Lake Lena Minnesota
Lake Lena is an unincorporated community and Native American village in Ogema Township Pine County Minnesota United States located along the Lower Tamarack River It currently is the administrative center for the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District III

Lake Lena is located 25 miles east of Hinckley and 7 miles westnorthwest of Danbury Wisconsin Lake Lena is 24 miles eastsoutheast of Sandstone

Grace Lake Road Pine County 173 serves as a main route in the community State Highway 48 MN 48 is nearby

Its name in the Ojibwe language is Aazhoomog meaning Crossroads in reference to being at the former crossroad of the northsouth trail connecting Bikoganaagan Danbury via the former Agaming OutflowLower Tamarack River Village and the former Gibaakwaiganing Tozer Camplower Upper Tamarack River Village with the eastwest trail connecting Mooningwanekaaning La Pointe via Namekaawaiganing Gordon with Gaazhiigwanaabikokaag Hinckley

Before the arrival of the Dakota Sioux the area about Lake Lena was inhabited by the Cheyenne Fox and HoChunk with migratory Gros Ventre Mandwe and Menominee peoples The Lake Lena area served as a place abundant with food in the heart of the Folle Avoine Region with Wild Rice and Sturgeon In addition the Lake Lena Village was located along the site of the annual Bear migratory path

With the arrival of the Dakota Sioux only the Fox remained as permanent residents of the region However occasional Cheyenne HoChunk and Menominee peoples still came to the area for the Wild Rice The Santee Sioux maintained a trade network routes offered by the St Croix River and the series of trails connecting the Lake Lena Village with Lake Superior Mississippi River headwaters and other major upper Mississippi River destinations Red Cedar River and Chippewa River With the arrival of the Ojibwe from the cultural center in La Pointe the area about the upper St Croix River became a contested place Though the Fox were permanently pushed out of the area the Dakota and Ojibwe eventually came to peace and lived sidebyside

After the Ojibwe had gained control of the upper St Croix River valley the Lake Lena area became one of many network of trade villages However in the 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien the United States formally drew the boundaries separating the Dakota and the Ojibwe For the Lake Lena and other Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe already intertwined with the Dakota this posed a problem With agreements the more southern Dakota north of the Prairie du Chien Line moved south of the line with the more northern Dakota north of the line were adopted as Ojibwe and became the Wolf Totem Meanwhile many of the Ojibwe located south of the line were adopted into the Mdewakanton By maintaining the trade network but with a different tribal association Aazhoomog transitioned from a DakotaOjibwe village to a fully Ojibwe village The Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe of the upper St Croix River valley became one of the signatories to the 1837 Treaty of St Peters and the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe The 1837 treaty dubbed the White Pine Treaty brought an influx of lumber industry After the Sandy Lake Tragedy the United States encouraged the consolidation of the Ojibwe onto Indian Reservations rather than removing them west of the Mississippi River In the treaty negotiations for the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe St Croix Chippewa realized that a central reservation would be created immediately south of the Upper St Croix Lake near Solon Springs Wisconsin Due to strong lumber interests the Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe knew the removal to a reservation would mean eventual loss of hunting fishing and gathering rights promised the 1837 and 1842 treaties Upon this realization the St Croix Chippewa refuted all provisions of the treaty negotiations and did not sign the 1854 treaty However by not signing the treaty the St Croix Chippewa lost their federal recognition However even as unrecognized Indian Tribe the St Croix Chippewa was still eligible to receive their annuities Depending on the time and location peoples of St Croix Chippewa went to either the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation or to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation Eventually the Lake Lena Village through the lumber operations in the region went to the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation more often than to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation

After the loss of federal recognition of the St Croix Chippewa the population of the Aazhoomog slowly declined For their annuity payment the people of Aazhoomog were sent to either the Lake Mille Lacs Indian Reservation or the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation Eventually the Aazhoomog Village through the lumber operations in the region went to the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation more often than to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation Aazhoomogs English name Lake Lena came about during this time named after Mrs Lena Thayer who operated a post office until the early 1920s Beginning in 1922 under the authority of the Consolidated Chippewa Agency Lake Lena Village began receiving services independent of the Mille Lacs Indians or the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians In 1936 when Minnesota Chippewa Tribe was created under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 the Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe was further divided between those located in Minnesota and those located in Wisconsin

When the contemporary Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe was organized its charter included the Mille Lacs Indians Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa and the St Croix Band of Chippewa Indians This was praised in the Lake Lena Village for regaining Federal recognition after 85 years of not having Federal recognition though it was not independent Federal recognition However this posed a major problem for the Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe on the Wisconsin side especially for those living about Danbury Wisconsin since the charter also included them yet they were not eligible to receive services from the Consolidated Chippewa Agency of Minnesota The remaining St Croix Chippewa on the Wisconsin side in order to maintain cohesion of the unrecognized tribe sought and gained Federal recognition independent of both the Mille Lacs and Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservations becoming the contemporary St Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin

Today the Aazhoomog village houses the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District III Government Services and Community Center and the Aazhoomog Clinic of the NeIaShing Clinic System The United States Postal Service places Aazhoomog under Sandstone Minnesota though a separate community of Asinikaaning exists The Lake Lena Village relies on the nearby Swiss Township fire department for fire emergencies Near the village the Mille Lacs Band operates the Crossroads Marathon gas station convenience store and laundromat

Grislidis
Grislidis is an opera described as a conte lyrique in three acts and a prologue by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Armand Silvestre and Eugne Morand It is based on the play by the same authors first performed at the ComdieFranaise on 15 May 1891 which is drawn from the medieval tale of patient Grissil The story is set in 14th century Provence and concerns the shepherdess Grislidis and a number of attempts by the Devil to lure her into infidelity Grislidis loyalty to her husband The Marquis is strong however and the devil is vanquished

Massenet began composition in 1894 completing it by the end of that year but revising it in the autumn 1898 prior to discussing a potential production with Albert Carr It was first performed at the OpraComique in Paris on 20 November 1901 with Lucienne Brval in the title role The piece achieved 50 performances in the first six months at the OpraComique was withdrawn from the repertory in 1906 and in a halfcentury had been seen there 73 times 

According to Rodney Milnes Grislidis on its own terms is one of Massenets most successful operas and does not deserve neglect the action moves swiftly the instrumentation is economic and delicate and the melodies unconstrained with a skilful mixture of comedy and sentiment and a vocally rewarding title role

The opera was staged in Nice Algiers Brussels and Milan in 1902 in Marseille in 1903 and 1950 and at the Paris Opra in 1922 Although not part of the current operatic repertoire more recently it has been seen in Wexford 1982 Strasbourg and Lige 1986 and SaintEtienne 1992 in concert

Evening time in the forest
The shepherd Alain sings of his love for Grislidis The Marquis out hunting sees her is overwhelmed and proposes marriage which she accepts to the despair of Alain
Four years later

Grislidis has a son and as the Marquis departs on a Crusade his servants promise to confine his wife which he rejects having complete trust in her The devil overhears all this and as he is unhappily married explains that he and his wife get pleasure from deceiving husbands The Marquis accepts the challenge and gives the Devil his ring as a pledge then taking leave of his wife and son Bertrade tries to distract Grislidis by telling her the story of the return of Ulysses
On a castle terrace six months later in autumn

Grislidis dreams sadly of her absent husband while the church bells toll The Devil and his wife approach Grislidis disguised as a slavetrader and a Persian houri showing her the ring to prove that the Marquis has rejected Grislidis To tempt Grislidis the Devil conjures a magic garden and lures Alain there The appearance of Los determines Grislidis not to return to Alain but his disappearance distracts her and the Devil takes the child away
While the castle servants search for Los the Devil now disguised as an obsequious old man tells Grislidis that a pirate is holding Los and will only release the child in exchange for a kiss from the Marquise The Marquis on returning meets the old man who points out Grislidis running to the shore but seeing the ring on the Devils finger realizes that he is the victim of deception The husband and wife are reunited they pray and Los is restored to them to the song of a heavenly chorus

Jon Weaving
Jon Weaving 23 February 193119 October 2011 was an Australian opera singer initially a bassbaritone but later a tenor

He was born on 23 February 1931 in the Melbourne suburb of Kew This was the very day on which his great forebear Dame Nellie Melba died His maternal cousin was the tenor Ken Neate He studied singing with Jessye Schmidt and Browning Mummery before leaving for further studies in London with Dino Borgioli Joan Cross Herman Simberg Audrey Langford Andrew Field and Glyndebournes Jani Strasser During this time he also worked as a rehearsal singer with Sir Thomas Beecham for two years before his friend Richard Bonynge assisted enormously in developing a tenor voice from his former bassbaritone After a further two years with Bonynge Weaving was engaged by the Sadlers Wells Opera and made his debut as Danilo in The Merry Widow opposite June Bronhill at the London Coliseum the first of many hundreds of performances of the role

At Sadlers Wells Weaving also sang Lensky in Eugene Onegin Alfredo in La traviata and Romo et Juliette opposite Elsie Morison as well as other operetta appearances including Pluto in Orpheus in the Underworld Raoul de Gardefeu in La Vie parisienne and Danilo all of which were recorded by HMV at Abbey Road studios In this time he made various recordings with the BBC the first of which was as Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus direct from a stage performance at the Wells He also sang again with June Bronhill when he appeared as Sir Walter Raleigh in Merrie England In 1962 Jon began a tour of Australia and New Zealand for Sadlers Wells which had become the English National Opera Company During this time he starred in a weekly television series with Suzanne Steele which ran on the ABC for three years He sang with the AllState Symphony Orchestra during this period and on his third tour of New Zealand directed and sang Frederick in The Pirates of Penzance at Her Majestys Theatre in Auckland

Returning to Europe in 1966 he was engaged by Benjamin Britten after many Covent Garden auditions for the role of MacHeath in Brittens adaptation of The Beggars Opera and sang this role under the baton of Norman Del Mar in London France and in Montreal at the World Expo in 1967 After study with Modesti in Paris he was engaged for his first Wagnerian role Lohengrin which he sang first at the Kiel Opera House in 1967 In Kiel he went on to sing Herman in Tchaikovskys The Queen of Spades Otello Andrier Chenier Hoffman Canio Gounods Faust Don Jose Florestan MacDuff in Macbeth etc as well as singing classical operetta roles such as Sou Chong in The Land of Smiles Danilo in The Merry Widow The Count of Luxembourg and The Gypsy Baron He also created roles in four world premieres during this time and later Rashomon for the Olympic Games in Munich He was constantly offered Wagnerian roles and finally agreed to sing Siegmund under the baton of Hans Zender and Klaus Tennstedt This was a success and was followed by Loge in Das Rheingold and Erik in The Flying Dutchman During this time in Kiel he guested all over Europe and returned to London for performances of Pluto in Orpheus in the Underworld and Bacchus in Ariadne auf Naxos under Sir Charles Mackerras He made numerous television appearances during this time also eg The Phil Silvers Show where he sang arias and appeared in a duet with his former idol Sergeant Bilko He made his debut at the Bavarian State Opera Munich as Dimitri in Boris Godunov under Rafael Kubelk and then returned to Australia for concerts and a recording of Malcolm Williamsons The Violins of SaintJacques with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra which was also released on video Returning to Europe he finally decided to accept offers to sing both Siegfrieds and sang his first Ring in London under the batons of Sir Charles Mackerras and Sir Reginald Goodall His first German Ring was in Wiesbaden and he was offered numerous contracts to sing the two roles in Italy Germany Switzerland and France He continued every year to sing the Siegfrieds and Siegmund in the famous English Ring in London and went on to create the Siegfrieds in the Herz Ring in Wagners birthplace Leipzig He sang in this famous production for several seasons before deciding to take his family back to Australia where he was to sing a recital tour with Geoffrey Parsons record two albums and sing numerous concerts for the ABC throughout Australia He sang Siegmund and Siegfried for the Australian Opera again under Sir Charles Mackerras and performed Die Walkre with both Hiroyuki Iwaki and Leif Segerstam With his wife the Swedish soprano Monique Brynnel he made a television series and appeared in numerous concerts and sang with her in seasons with the Victorian and Queensland Opera companies He lived in Kew in Melbourne and made a career teaching singing privately having numerous successful students enter the opera world He had two sons Jon b 1955 to first wife soprano Margaret Nisbett and Jack b 1974

Jon was offered numerous film roles the highlight of which was to be invited to Rome by Federico Fellini to screen test for the lead in Fellinis Casanova This he declined in order to continue his operatic career He had many very successful singing students

In May 2011 Jon Weaving and Monique Brynnel emigrated from Australia to Sweden They established a singing school in their new home town Jon Weaving died of pancreatic cancer in Sweden on 19 October 2011 aged 80

  Die integrated circuit
  A die in the context of integrated circuits is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated Typically integrated circuits are produced in large batches on a single wafer of electronicgrade silicon EGS or other semiconductor such as GaAs through processes such as photolithography The wafer is cut diced into many pieces each containing one copy of the circuit Each of these pieces is called a die

  There are three commonly used plural forms dice dies and die To simplify handling and integration onto a printed circuit board most dice are packaged in various forms

  Most dies are composed of silicon and used for integrated circuits The process begins with the production of monocrystalline silicon ingots These ingots are then sliced into disks with a diameter of up to 300mm These wafers are then polished to a mirror finish before going through photolithography In many steps the transistors are manufactured and connected with metal interconnect layers These prepared wafers then go through wafer testing to test their functionality The wafers are then sliced and sorted to filter out the faulty dies Functional dies are then packaged and the completed integrated circuit is ready to be shipped

  A die can host many types of circuits One common use case of an integrated circuit die is in the form of a Central Processing Unit CPU Through advances in modern technology the size of the transistor within the die has shrunk exponentially following Moores Law Other uses for dies can range from LED lighting to power semiconductor devices

  Cyclic ADPribose
  Cyclic ADP Ribose frequently abbreviated as cADPR is a cyclic adenine nucleotide like cAMP with two phosphate groups present on 5 OH of the adenosine like ADP further connected to another ribose at the 5 position which in turn closes the cycle by glycosidic bonding to the nitrogen 1 N of the same adenine base whose position N has the glycosidic bond to the other ribose The Nglycosidic bond to adenine is what distinguishes cADPR from ADPribose ADPR the noncyclic analog cADPR is produced from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD by ADPribosyl cyclases  as part of a second messenger system

  cADPR is a cellular messenger for calcium signaling It stimulates calciuminduced calcium release at lower cytosolic concentrations of Ca Primary target of cADPR is the ER Ca2 uptake mechanism Potentiation of Ca2 release by cADPR is mediated by increased accumulation of Ca2 in the SR

  cADPR and ADPR are synthesized from NAD by the bifunctional ectoenzymes of the CD38 family also includes the GPIanchored CD157 and the specific monofunctional ADP ribosyl cyclase of the mollusc Aplysia The same enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing cADPR to ADPR Catalysis proceeds via a covalently bound intermediate The hydrolysis reaction is inhibited by ATP and cADPR may accumulate Synthesis and degradation of cADPR by enzymes of the CD38 family involve respectively the formation and the hydrolysis of the Nglycosidic bond In 2009 the first enzyme able to hydrolyze the phosphoanhydride linkage of cADPR ie the one between the two phosphate groups has been reported

  Mill Bluff State Park
  Mill Bluff State Park is a state park in westcentral Wisconsin United States It is located in eastern Monroe and western Juneau counties near the village of Camp Douglas A unit of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve the park protects several prominent sandstone bluffs to high that formed as sea stacks 12000 years ago in Glacial Lake Wisconsin As a result these bluffs are steep and angular dissimilar to the rounded terrain more typical of the eastern half of the United States The bluffs served as landmarks to both early pioneers and travelers today on Interstate 9094 which passes through the park

  There are ten named bluffs in the park Mill Bluff high is between the interstate and US Route 12 The park office is at its foot and the campground is just to the west Bee Bluff although smaller and only high is the most visible bluff from the interstate as it stands adjacent to the westbound lanes To the north is Camels Bluff two separate outcroppings that together resemble the humps of a camel Nearby are Devils Monument and a high pinnacle called Cleopatras Needle The other less accessible bluffs are Round Bluff and Sugar Bowl Bluff to the south Wildcat Bluff and Bear Bluff to the north and Long Bluff to the northeast Also in the northeast is Ragged Rock an tall former bluff whose protective cap was worn away and is eroding into a conical mound

  The bluffs in the park and others nearby are formed of Late Cambrian sandstone Stratigraphically the stone of the bluffs is part of the Galesville Member of the Dresbach Group Sandstone from the Ironton Member of the Franconia Formation which is more solidly concreted tops each bluff This capping layer helped protect the softer stone below it from erosion Similar structures elsewhere in Wisconsin would have been bulldozed away by glaciers but these bluffs lie in the Driftless Area that part of the American Midwest which was never glaciated The bluffs are all outliers of the Franconia Cuesta to the south

  During the last ice age a tongue of ice dammed the Wisconsin River causing the water to back up into Glacial Lake Wisconsin It is estimated that the lake was about deep in this area so the taller bluffs became islands while the shorter ones would have been entirely underwater For the 3000 years of the lakes existence waves eroded the edges of the bluffs giving them their distinctive steep sides Thus in a geological sense the bluffs are sea stacks because they formed in a body of water In practice the larger formations are described as mesas the mediumsized ones as buttes and the smallest as a pinnacle

  The flat ground in the park consists of finely sorted sediments that settled to the bottom of Glacial Lake Wisconsin Glacial erratics have been found on the former lakebed which are explained as rocks which were embedded in icebergs that melted as they were floating in the lake

  The park is mostly forested with northern pin oak jack pine red pine eastern white pine and white oak dominant

  Several of the bluffs bear 400yearold petroglyphs shaped like bird tracks contemporaneous with the RocheaCri Petroglyphs in RocheaCri State Park

  The diaries and journals of westbound settlers often mention these bluffs A sawmill was operated in the vicinity after which Mill Bluff was named

  Mill Bluff and a small area at its foot was proclaimed a state park on August 13 1936 Mill Bluff State Park was added to the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve in May 1971 The parks boundaries were expanded to include the other bluffs later In 2002 a portion of the park containing all of the major bluffs received a further level of protection as Mill Bluff State Natural Area

  Mill Bluff State Park is open from May to September Small game hunting is permitted in sections of the park from November 1 to December 15 and deer hunting during a shorter period

  The parks small campground has 21 sites 6 with electrical hookups Amenities are primitive with pit toilets and no showers Potable water is available from hand pumps

  Swimming is available in a springfed lake south of the campground Sand has been added to make a beach

  A nature trail circles the base of Mill Bluff 223 stone steps built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s lead to its top north on County Road W Funnel Road is a pullout for the Camels Bluff loop trail which passes between the two sections of Camels Bluff and leads past the base of Devils Monument and Cleopatras Needle

  Because the bluffs are formed of soft sandstone and geologically unique all climbing is prohibited

 <doc id="7736733" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7736733" title="Seismic source">
  Seismic source
  A seismic source is a device that generates controlled seismic energy used to perform both reflection and refraction seismic surveys A seismic source can be simple such as dynamite or it can use more sophisticated technology such as a specialized air gun Seismic sources can provide single pulses or continuous sweeps of energy generating seismic waves which travel through a medium such as water or layers of rocks Some of the waves then reflect and refract and are recorded by receivers such as geophones or hydrophones

  Seismic sources may be used to investigate shallow subsoil structure for engineering site characterization or to study deeper structures either in the search for petroleum and mineral deposits or to map subsurface faults or for other scientific investigations The returning signals from the sources are detected by seismic sensors geophones or hydrophones in known locations relative to the position of the source The recorded signals are then subjected to specialist processing and interpretation to yield comprehensible information about the subsurface

  A seismic source signal has the following characteristics
  The generalized equation that shows all above properties is
  where formula2 is the maximum frequency component of the generated waveform

  The most basic seismic source is a sledge hammer either striking the ground directly or more commonly striking a metal plate on the ground known as hammer and plate Useful for seismic refraction surveys down to about 20 m below surface

  Explosives most widely used as seismic sources are knows as gelatin dynamites These dynamites are placed into three subcategories straight gelatins in which nitroglycerin also known as glyceryl trinitrate with the chemical formula C3H5ONO23 is the active component ammonia gelatins in which ammonia nitrite with chemical formula NHNO as the active component and semi gelatins in which the composition consists mostly of nitroglycerin

  Upon detonation explosives release large volumes of expanding gas very quickly forcing great pressure to the surroundings in the form of seismic waves

  Using explosives as seismic sources has been in practice for decades because of the reliability and energy efficiency they provide Such sources are most commonly used on land and swampy environments because of high thickness in sedimentsTypical charge sizes used in the field for reflection surveys are 025kg to 100kg for single hole sources 025kg to 250kg or more for multiple hole sources and may reach 2500kg or more for refraction surveys

  Though dynamites and other explosives are efficient seismic sources because of their reduced costs ease of transport in difficult terrains and lack of regular maintenance compared to other sourcesthe use of explosives is becoming restricted in certain areas causing decline and increasing popularity for alternative seismic sources

  For instance hexanitrostilbene was the main explosive fill in the thumper mortar round canisters used as part of the Apollo Lunar Active Seismic Experiments Generally the explosive charges are placed between below ground in a hole that is drilled with dedicated drilling equipment for this purpose This type of seismic drilling is often referred to as Shot Hole Drilling A common drill rig used for Shot Hole Drilling is the ARDCO C1000 drill mounted on an ARDCO K 4X4 buggy These drill rigs often use water or air to assist the drilling

  An air gun is used for marine reflection and refraction surveys It consists of one or more pneumatic chambers that are pressurized with compressed air at pressures from 14 to 21 MPa 2000 to 3000 lbfin Air guns are submerged below the water surface and towed behind a ship When an air gun is fired a solenoid is triggered which releases air into a fire chamber which in turn causes a piston to move thereby allowing the air to escape the main chamber and producing a pulse of acoustic energy Air gun arrays may consist of up to 48 individual air guns with different size chambers fired in concert the aim being to create the optimum initial shock wave followed by the minimum reverberation of the air bubbles

  Air guns are made from the highest grades of corrosion resistant stainless steel Large chambers ie greater than 1L or 70cuin tend to give low frequency signals and the small chambers less than 1 L give higher frequency signals

  A plasma sound source PSS otherwise called a spark gap sound source or simply a sparker is a means of making a very low frequency sonar pulse underwater For each firing electric charge is stored in a large highvoltage bank of capacitors and then released in an arc across electrodes in the water The underwater spark discharge produces a highpressure plasma and vapor bubble which expands and collapses making a loud sound Most of the sound produced is between 20 and 200Hz useful for both seismic and sonar applications

  There are also plans to use PSS as a nonlethal weapon against submerged divers

  In 1953 the weight dropping thumper technique was introduced as an alternative to dynamite sources
  A thumper truck or weightdrop truck is a vehiclemounted ground impact system which can be used to provide a seismic source A heavy weight is raised by a hoist at the back of the truck and dropped generally about three meters to impact or thump the ground To augment the signal the weight may be dropped more than once at the same spot the signal may also be increased by thumping at several nearby places in an array whose dimensions may be chosen to enhance the seismic signal by spatial filtering

  More advanced thumpers use a technology called Accelerated Weight Drop AWD where a high pressure gas min 7 MPa 1000 lbfin is used to accelerate a heavy weight hammer  to hit a base plate coupled to the ground from a distance of  Several thumps are stacked to enhance signal to noise ratio AWD allows both more energy and more control of the source than gravitational weightdrop providing better depth penetration control of signal frequency content

  Thumping may be less damaging to the environment than firing explosives in shotholes though a heavily thumped seismic line with transverse ridges every few meters might create longlasting disturbance of the soil An advantage of the thumper later shared with Vibroseis especially in politically unstable areas is that no explosives are required

  EMP sources based on the electrodynamic and electromagnetic principles

  A Seismic vibrator propagates energy signals into the Earth over an extended period of time as opposed to the near instantaneous energy provided by impulsive sources The data recorded in this way must be correlated to convert the extended source signal into an impulse The source signal using this method was originally generated by a servocontrolled hydraulic vibrator or shaker unit mounted on a mobile base unit but electromechanical versions have also been developed

  The Vibroseis exploration technique was developed by the Continental Oil Company Conoco during the 1950s and was a trademark until the companys patent lapsed

  Boomer sound sources are used for shallow water seismic surveys mostly for engineering survey applications Boomers are towed in a floating sled behind a survey vessel Similar to the plasma source a boomer source stores energy in capacitors but it discharges through a flat spiral coil instead of generating a spark A copper plate adjacent to the coil flexes away from the coil as the capacitors are discharged This flexing is transmitted into the water as the seismic pulse

  Originally the storage capacitors were placed in a steel container the bang box on the survey vessel The high voltages used typically 3000 V required heavy cables and strong safety containers Recently low voltage boomers have become available These use capacitors on the towed sled allowing efficient energy recovery lower voltage power supplies and lighter cables The low voltage systems are generally easier to deploy and have fewer safety concerns

  Correlationbased processing techniques also enable seismologists to image the interior of the Earth at multiple scales using natural eg the oceanic microseism or artificial eg urban background noise as a seismic source For example under ideal conditions of uniform seismic illumination the correlation of the noise signals between two seismographs provides an estimate of the bidirectional seismic impulse response

  VX videocassette format
  VX was a shortlived and unsuccessful consumer analog recording videocassette format developed by Matsushita and launched in 1975 in Japan In the United States it was sold using the Quasar brand and marketed under the name The Great Time Machine to exhibit its timeshifting capabilities since VX machines had a companion electromechanical clock timer for timed recording of television programs In Japan the VX100 model was launched in 1975 with the VX2000 following in 1976 The first and only model sold in North America was the Quasar VR1000 based on the Panasonic VX2000 with the VT100 timer

  The VX cassette itself had both reels of magnetic tape stacked on top of each other in a coaxial fashion much like the earlier Philips VCR and Cartrivision formats in the bottom half of the tape with a circular opening on the underside of the top half of the cassette where the video head drum would enter The tape in this opening was preformed in a loop to go around the head drum eliminating the need for the tape to be pulled out of the cassette and threaded around the drum as with later videocassette formats such as VHS and Betamax The opening was protected by a cylindrical plastic plug to protect the tape which was unscrewed from the opening when the tape was loaded in the machine by means of moving a horizontal lever on the front of the machine and inserted back into the tape when ejected by moving the lever back

  The video head drum itself of a VX machine also has the unique distinction of being completely removable and replaceable without any special tools or equipment The drum has a knurled nut on top which can be adjusted by hand allowing the drum to be removed from the deck for cleaning or replacement To this date the VX machines have been the only VCR designed with this feature

  Hand fetishism or hand partialism or also Quirofilia is the sexual fetish for hands This may include the sexual attraction to a specific area such as the fingers palm or nails or the attraction to a specific action performed by the hands which may otherwise be considered nonsexualsuch as washing or drying dishes This fetish may manifest itself as a desire to experience physical interaction or as a source of sexual fantasy

  Hand fetishism is recognized by the porn industry however aside from handjobs it is one of the least common fetishes despite foot fetishism being the most common

  Hand fetishism is usually based in the biological indication that a partner is healthy and a good potential mate

  A hand fetish is a sexual attraction to the hands This attraction is most commonly expressed with fingering handjobs sucking on the fingers and licking the palms

  Fingernail fetishism a subtype of hand fetishism is often expressed with scratching with the fingernails and painting the fingernails

  In 2007 a study was conducted by the University of Bologna on around 5000 fetishist participants to see the prevalence of fetishes The study analyzed the content inside online fetish communities and found only 669 participants referring to nails an extension of hand fetishism This did not refer to fingernails specifically and the amount of 669 was less than 1 of the participants

  In the animemanga series JoJos Bizarre Adventure the character Yoshikage Kira is a serial killer who murders women in order to pretend to date their severed hands

  Phase factor
  For any complex number written in polar form such as re the phase factor is the complex exponential factor e As such the term phase factor is related to the more general term phasor which may have any magnitude ie not necessarily part of the circle group The phase factor is a unit complex number ie of absolute value 1 It is commonly used in quantum mechanics

  The variable  appearing in such an expression is generally referred to as the phase Multiplying the equation of a plane wave Ae by a phase factor shifts the phase of the wave by

  In quantum mechanics a phase factor is a complex coefficient e that multiplies a ket formula2 or bra formula3 It does not in itself have any physical meaning since the introduction of a phase factor does not change the expectation values of a Hermitian operator That is the values of formula4 and formula5 are the same However differences in phase factors between two interacting quantum states can sometimes be measurable such as in the Berry phase and this can have important consequences

  In optics the phase factor is an important quantity in the treatment of interference

  Roy Lewis
  Roy Lewis 6 November 1913  1996 was an English writer and small press printer

  Although born in Felixstowe Lewis was brought up in Birmingham and educated at King Edwards School After studying at University College Oxford earning his BA in 1934 he went on to study at the London School of Economics He began his career as an economist but after serving as an editor on the journal Statist he became interested in journalism He took a sabbatical in 1938 to travel to Australia and India He married Christine Tew in 1939 after returning to England They had two daughters

  Beginning in July 1939 he collaborated with Randal Heymanson to produce a newsletter called Vital News that they distributed confidentially to British and American government policymakers and bankers until December 1941

  From 1943 to 1946 he worked for the Peking Syndicate a firm specialising in investments in China but left to work as a journalist for the weekly Scope Hired by the Economist magazine he served as its Washington DC correspondent from 1952 to 1961 He settled fulltime in England in 1961 where he became a feature writer for The Times remaining with the newspaper until he retired in 1971 In 1957 he had set up the Keepsake Press initially to hand print family ephemera He soon began serious though smallscale production and by the time infirmity forced him to discontinue in 1990 he had brought out over a hundred titles

  The majority of the books that Lewis wrote or edited often jointly were nonfiction and closely related to his journalism However he is best known for his 1960 novel The Evolution Man which went through six editions under a number of titles This comic novel purports to be a firsthand account by the son of the first man to discover fire To prevent further advances the family takes matters in hand leading to a conclusion given away by the books eventual subtitle how I ate my father Continuing authorship into old age Lewis published a second novel in 1990 the same year that a play of his on William Shakespeare was performed in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe followed by a novella in 1991 and a further novel in 1995 All three of these later fictions were provocative reinterpretations of Victorian times

  Rhamphorhynchoidea
  The Rhamphorhynchoidea forms one of the two suborders of pterosaurs and represent an evolutionary grade of primitive members of this group of flying reptiles This suborder is paraphyletic in relation to the Pterodactyloidea which arose from within the Rhamphorhynchoidea not from a more distant common ancestor Because it is not a completely natural grouping Rhamphorhynchoidea is not used as a formal group in most scientific literature though some pterosaur scientists continue to use it as an informal grouping in popular works such as The Pterosaurs From Deep Time by David Unwin and in some formal studies Rhamphorhynchoids were the first pterosaurs to have appeared in the late Triassic Period Norian age about 210 million years ago Unlike their descendants the pterodactyloids most rhamphorhynchoids had teeth and long tails and most species lacked a bony crest though several are known to have crests formed from soft tissue like keratin They were generally small with wingspans rarely exceeding 25 meters though one species alluded to by Alexander Stoyanow might be among the largest pterosaurs of all time with a wingspan of 10 meters comparable to the largest azhdarchids Nearly all had become extinct by the end of the Jurassic Period though least one anurognathid genus Dendrorhynchoides persisted to the early Cretaceous The family Wukongopteridae which shows a mix of rhamphorhynchoid and pterodactyloid features is known from the Daohugou Beds which are most commonly dated to the Jurassic but a few studies give a Cretaceous date Further more remains of a nonpterodactyloid from the Candeleros Formation extend the presence of basal pterosaurs into the at least early Late Cretaceous

  Lysyl oxidase
  Lysyl oxidase LOX also known as proteinlysine 6oxidase is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LOX gene Its inhibition can cause osteolathyrism but at the same time its upregulation by tumor cells may promote metastasis of the existing tumor causing it to become malignant and cancerous

  In the yeast strain Pichia pastoris lysyl oxidase constitutes a homodimeric structure Each monomer consists of an active site that includes a CuII atom coordinated with three histidine residues as well as 245trihydroxyphenalanine quinone TPQ a crucial cofactor

  In humans the LOX gene is located on chromosome 5q233312 The DNA sequence encodes a polypeptide of 417 amino acids the first 21 residues of which constitute a signal peptide with a weight of approximately 32 kDa The carboxyterminus contains the active copper II ion lysine tyrosine and cysteine residues that comprise the catalytically active site The threedimensional structure of human lysyl oxidase has not yet been resolved

  The mechanism of lysyl oxidase occurs via modification of the amino group of a lysine side chain The enzyme falls into the category of quinonecontaining copper amine oxidases and the reaction is highly dependent on the cofactor lysyl tyrosylquinone LTQ The LTQ cofactor is unique among quinones due to its orthobenzoquinone structure and neutral charge under physiological pH This can be contrasted with the similar ubiquitous quinocofactor TPQ which exists as a negatively charged structure under physiological conditions and includes orthoparacarbonyl resonance functionality

  LTQ is crucial in LOXcatalyzed conversion of lysine residues to aminoadipidicsemialdehydes generally referred to as allysines In the oxidation of lysine the amine is first converted to a Schiff base via reaction with LTQ While LTQ is still bound to the substrate ratelimiting removal of the proton yields an imine intermediate Subsequent hydrolysis of the imine leads to release of the aldehyde product allysine Molecular oxygen and the copper ion are utilized to reoxidize the cofactor and yield another imine producing hydrogen peroxide as a side product Additional hydrolysis releases ammonia and the original cofactor completing the catalytic cycle

  Lysyl oxidase is an extracellular copperdependent enzyme that catalyzes formation of aldehydes from lysine residues in collagen and elastin precursors These aldehydes are highly reactive and undergo spontaneous chemical reactions with other lysyl oxidasederived aldehyde residues or with unmodified lysine residues This results in crosslinking collagen and elastin which is essential for stabilization of collagen fibrils and for the integrity and elasticity of mature elastin

  Complex crosslinks are formed in collagen pyridinolines derived from three lysine residues and in elastin desmosines derived from four lysine residues that differ in structure

  The importance of lysyl oxidasederived crosslinking was established from animal studies in which lysyl oxidase was inhibited either by nutritional copperdeficiency or by supplementation of diets with aminopropionitrile BAPN an inhibitor of lysyl oxidase This resulted in lathyrism characterized by poor bone formation and strength hyperextensible skin weak ligaments and increased occurrence of aortic aneurysms These abnormalities correlated well with decreased crosslinking of collagen and elastin

  Developmentally reduced lysyl oxidase levels have been implicated in Menkes disease and Occipital horn syndrome two Xlinked recessive disorders characterized by a mutation in a gene for copper transportation Thus not only is LOX crucial to cardiovascular development it is thought to play a major role in connective tissue development and may also be important in neurological function

  Lysyl oxidase has also proven crucial to the development of the respiratory system and the skin as collagen and elastin represent 5060 of the composition of the lung and 75 of the skin In LOX double knockout models Lox  function of LOX was reduced by up to 80 and the phenotype of the lungs resembles those of human patients with emphysema and dilated distal airways

  Finally lysyl oxidase plays a crucial role in the commitment step of adipocyte or fat cell formation from pluripotent stem cells during development Its absence may lead to defects in the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of proteins which control cell growth and differentiation

  LOX expression is regulated by hypoxiainducible factors HIFs and hence LOX expression is often upregulated in hypoxic breast and head and neck tumors Patients with high LOXexpressing tumors have poor overall survival Furthermore inhibition of LOX has been demonstrated to eliminate metastases in mice Secreted LOX is responsible for the invasive properties of hypoxic cancer cells through focal adhesion kinase activity and celltomatrix adhesion LOX may be required to create a niche permissive for metastatic growth and thus may be required for hypoxiainduced metastasis In fact recent research has shown overexpression of LOX as crucial to promoting tumor growth and metastasis in several cancers including breast cancer melanoma nonsmall cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer

  LOX expression was also detected in megakaryocytes or bone marrow cells responsible for the production of platelets Data derived from a mouse model of myelofibrosis implicated LOX in bone marrow fibrosis

  In a rodent model of breast cancer a smallmolecule or antibody inhibitors of LOX abolished metastasis LOX secreted by hypoxic breast tumor cells crosslinks collagen in the basement membrane and is essential for CD11b myeloid cell recruitment CD11b cells in turn adhere to crosslinked collagen and produce matrix metalloproteinase2 which cleaves collagen enhancing the invasion of metastasizing tumor cells In contrast LOX inhibition prevents CD11b cell recruitment and metastatic growth

  In cells lacking TGF receptors a deficiency that is characteristic of lung cancer lysyl oxidase is found in high concentrations LOX immunostaining has revealed that high LOX expression is associated with high extent of carcinoma invasion in samples obtained from surgically removed lung adenocarcinomas Additionally LOX expression is an indicator of 5year survival in patients with a 71 chance of survival for patients with low LOX levels compared to 43 for patients with high LOX levels Thus upregulation of lysyl oxidase is a predictor of poor prognosis in earlystage adenocarcinoma patients

  Lysyl oxidase has been newly implicated in tumor angiogenesis or blood vessel formation both in vivo and in vitro Subcutaneous tumorderived LOX was shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF expression and secretion which then promotes angiogenesis by phosphorylation of protein kinase B or Akt through plateletderived growth factor receptor  PDGFRB High levels of LOX were associated with high blood vessel density in patient samples Clinically relevant LOX inhibitors may help slow cancer progression by downregulating crucial growth factors that promote solid tumor progression

  Hence inhibitors of the LOX enzyme may be useful in preventing angiogenesis tumor progression and metastasis as well as treating other fibrotic disease involving remodeling of the extracellular matrix including neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases

  VCord
  VCord is an analog recording videocassette format developed and released by Sanyo VCord later referred to as VCord I was released in 1974 and could record 60 minutes on a cassette VCord II released in 1976 could record 120 minutes on a VCord II cassette

  The VCord II machines were the first consumer VCRs to offer two recording speeds

  The original VCord cassette had a large hub and was wound with standardthickness magnetic tape VCord II used a small hub wound with thin tape the same thickness later used for VHS120 and Beta L750 The cassettes were rectangular unlike subsequent formats VHS and Betamax which loaded with the tape facing front on the long side of the cassette the VCord cartridge was loaded sideways with the narrow side serving as the front and the tape coming out the side

  The tape was held in place in the machine by a notch halfway down the right side of the tape similar to what holds an 8track tape into its player

  The earliest machines recorded only in black and white and had no rewind mechanism like the Cartrivision format of a few years earlier an external rewinder was used after recording or playing a tape External rewinders were later used with the VHS and Beta formats although the machines could rewind tapes external rewinders were considerably faster than the rewind function

  The system had two recording modes standard mode STD and a longplay mode LP which sacrificed recording quality for extra capacity In STD mode both recording and playback heads are used writing both fields of each interlaced video frame In longplay mode only a single head is used to record a single field from each video frame with each field being read twice on playback in a skip field technique The heads scanned the tape in a helical scan fashion

  Tape was moved forward at 291 inches per second in STD mode and 145 inches per second in LP mode this gave a recording time of onehour in standard mode and two hours in longplay mode Horizontal resolution in color was quoted as 250 lines in advertising materials stretching to 300 lines in blackandwhite with a video signaltonoise ratio of 45dB Audio response was specified as 80 to 10000Hz at 6dB in STD mode dropping to 80 to 8000Hz in LP mode

  The tape was a halfinch cobalt doped tape with a 550 oersted coercivity The cassette measured 4 by 6 by 1 Two cassette types were available a V60 and a V120 whose names matched their recording capacity in LP mode The cassettes are similar in appearance to eighttrack cartridges

  Conventional VHS and Beta formats recorded in a helical scan format resulting in angled tracks running from the lower edge of the tape to the upper edge some distance down Unlike these formats the VCord format was closer to the 2inch quadruplex videotape format used from the inception of video in the late 1950s until 2inch helical IVC videotape format was introduced twenty years later in that its tracks ran nearly perpendicular to tape travel

  A portable fourhead video recorder the Sanyo VTC7100 used a similar format of cassette but produced incompatible recordings

  Cliff Barnes
  Clifford Cliff Barnes played by Ken Kercheval is a fictional character from the popular American television series Dallas The Barnes family are competitors and sometimes enemies of the Ewing family Cliff is the son of Willard Digger Barnes and Rebecca Barnes the older halfbrother of Pamela Barnes Ewing and Katherine Wentworth JR Ewing played by Larry Hagman was Cliffs personal nemesis with Cliff and JR continuing on the bitter feud that started with their fathers Digger Barnes and Jock Ewing from their oil wildcatting days in the 1930s Cliff and JR were the only two characters to appear throughout the entire run of the series A running gag on the series is Cliffs fondness for Chinese takeout

  During the shows original conception the character of Cliff was modeled on the late Robert F Kennedy However he evolved into a bumbling sad sack who was very much his own worst enemy A lawyer and a bureaucrat not an oil man Cliff was out of his element when dealing in the cutthroat oil business and despite repeated attempts would always be outsmarted and outdone by his rival JR Thanks to Carter McKay Cliff finally beats JR in the final season and takes over Ewing Oil

  Cliff had a close relationship with his sister Pamela played by Victoria Principal and hated that she married Bobby Ewing played by Patrick Duffy JRs younger brother

  When Dallas began Cliff worked for the state of Texas building an impressive recorded reputation as investigator of corruption within the independent oil companies It was no coincidence that these investigations often cited or targeted Ewing Oil During the second and third seasons Cliffs career took an upward swing when he was appointed Chief of the Office of Land Management a fictional enormously powerful state agency that coordinated and approved all ventures that affected the surface and geological texture of Texas land including oil drilling permits In an attempt to lure Barnes out of this powerful position JR Ewing enlisted attorney Alan Beam in a scheme to form an exploratory funding committee funds solely provided by JR Ewing promoting Barnes as a candidate for the US Congress The scheme worked as Barnes resigned from his position to run for Congress After his resignation the money flow to the campaign stopped and Barnes was forced to drop out of the race

  Cliff had an affair with JRs wife Sue Ellen played by Linda Gray during the second season of Dallas When Sue Ellen became pregnant it was believed Cliff was the father of her baby After a dizzy spell sent Digger to the doctor he was diagnosed as a carrier of neurofibromatosis a genetic disorder which hed passed on to Cliff As neurofibromatosis poses a greater threat to infants than to adults the doctor strongly advised them not to have children Cliff was worried that John Ross III might develop the potentially fatal disease but Bobby and Pam convinced him to keep quiet They all decided to monitor the babys health until he passed a critical age

  After Cliff was forced to drop out of the Congressional race he quickly figured out that JR had been behind the plot and vowed revenge When a newspaper reporter interviewed Digger about Cliffs resignation he told her that Cliff was really the father of John Ross III Cliff realized that the scandal would embarrass JR and sued for custody In order to prove paternity blood tests had to be performed on Sue Ellen and JR The first test proved inconclusive but a second DNA test confirmed that JR was John Ross IIIs father after all

  In a major step backwards Barnes took a position as a Dallas assistant district attorney Shortly after taking the position Barnes promoted the prosecution of Jock Ewing for a 30yearold murder which was dismissed after ironically Digger Barnes confessed to the murder on his deathbed In season four Cliff Barnes began working with State Senator Dave Culver believing that Culver the son of Sam Culver a Texas and national political icon would be destined for powerful office During this time Cliff also formed a personal relationship with Donna Culver played by Susan Howard who was Daves most trusted advisor and the widow of Sam Relations between Donna and Cliff soured and quickly ended when Dave was appointed to the US Senate and Donnas party committee chose Bobby Ewing instead of Barnes to run for his vacant state senate seat After Bobby Ewing won the senate race as a favor to wife Pam he asked Barnes to be his chief senate counsel Cliff accepted but after a short tenure they had a falling out over Cliffs decision without consulting Bobby to start a senate investigation against JR for alleged organization of a counterrevolution in Southeast Asia

  In the course of the fourth season Cliffs mother Rebecca Wentworth played by Priscilla Pointer made a dramatic reentry into his life After much debating Cliff forgave her for her desertion It also delighted Cliff that his mother was an important lady who was wealthy and powerful in her own right Rebecca eventually offered him the presidency of Wentworth Tool  Die a small subsidiary of Wentworth Industries which made parts for oil rigs Cliff happily accepted and did extraordinarily well for a time Eventually Cliff asked for and received complete autonomy at Wentworth Tool  Die  but his fortunes took a dramatic downturn when he wasted Wentworth funds on a phony deal engineered by JR Cliffs mother subsequently sacked him  this coupled with Sue Ellens decision to remarry JR around the same time drove Cliff to attempt suicide

  Cliff recovered and Rebecca subsequently bought out Wade Luce Oil renaming it BarnesWentworth Oil Rebecca asked Cliff to run the company for her and he accepted  blaming JR for Cliffs suicide attempt Rebecca encouraged Cliff to use the company and the place in the Cartel which came with it to gain revenge Armed with a new lease on life and a new hatred for the Ewings he became driven to succeed and as a result turned BarnesWentworth into a very successful company That year Cliff won the coveted Oil Man Of the Year award at the Oil Barons Ball However instead of enjoying his success he embarrassed himself by verbally trashing Jock Ewing and Ewing Oil during his acceptance speech resulting in a huge brawl

  Rebecca died soon after from injuries sustained in a plane crash and Cliff inherited BarnesWentworth Oil as well as a third of Wentworth Industries much to the disgust of his half sister Katherine
  During the fifth season Cliff and Sue Ellen became romantically involved again and he proposed marriage however she turned him down and eventually remarried JR Cliff did find happiness again with aspiring singer Afton Cooper played by Audrey Landers the sister of Lucy Ewings husband Mitch Cooper It would later transpire that Afton gave birth to a daughter Pamela Rebecca after the end of her relationship with Cliff At the start of the penultimate season it was revealed that Pamela was indeed Cliffs daughter although Afton disgusted by Cliffs lying to her tricked him into believing otherwise

  Cliff married Jamie Ewing daughter of the late Jason Ewing and therefore a cousin of JR and Bobby played by Jenilee Harrison in 1985 but the union was unhappy at first Cliff having married Jamie purely for the inheritance he always believed to be his birthright During the 198586 season they realized how much they loved one another and became close In April 1986 Jamie was seen trapped in a blazing car and presumed dead But the entire 198586 season turned out to be the nightmare of Cliffs sister Pam So Cliff and Jamies happy marriage and her supposed death were just a dream and thus Cliff and Jamie never found happiness She left him in fall 1986 and the union was headed for a divorce when it was explained that Jamie was killed due to a fall while on a mountain climbing holiday

  Cliff eventually realizes his dream of taking over a share of Ewing Oil and for a time enjoys a good personal and business relationship with Bobby whilst JR is temporarily sidelined from the business It is notable that Cliff and Bobby appear to find mutual respect and liking only after Pamela has gone and their family ties are effectively severed Cliff is also shown at this time to be a loving and attentive uncle to Christopher who is suffering from the absence of his mother Cliff enjoys a seemingly open welcome to Southfork during this time something that would have been unheard of in earlier seasons JR eventually returned to Ewing Oil and while they were briefly able to coexist it didnt last JRs maneuvering and Cliffs inattention to the business due to his attempts to win back Afton the only woman I ever loved soon had Cliff falling out of favor once again with the Ewings By the end of the series the feud that had characterized much of Dallass run was firmly back on

  A theme of Cliff Barnes character was social class conflict with his nemesis JR Ewing Cliff had grown up poor in contrast to JR after the partnership between Cliffs father Digger and Jock Ewing dissolved due in large part to Diggers heavy drinking Jock went on to found Ewing Oil Digger blamed Jock for his subsequent bad luck and was jealous of Jocks wealth Cliff inherited Diggers resentment of the Ewings and as well as the tendency to sometimes drink heavily As time went on his hatred for the Ewings with the exception of JR dissipated as Cliff realized that his father was not blameless in regards to the BarnesEwing feud Throughout the series Cliff had a reputation for being cheap and naive in contrast to JR Whereas JR always dined in fine restaurants wore a stylish Stetson lived on Southfork and lavished his mistresses with generosity Cliff often preferred takeout Chinese cuisine wore cheap suits lived in a condominium and assumed his romantic interests would clean his home While JR was smooth talking and charismatic Cliff tended to speak before he thought and frequently stuck his foot in his mouth Much of the drama of Dallas was centered around Cliffs attempts to revenge himself against JR politically romantically and financially Typically Cliffs schemes failed because of JRs underhanded cleverness

  Cliff eventually got one over JR shortly before the TV series ended when he took over Ewing Oil

  In the series finale Conundrum in 1991 Cliff appears in JRs dream where with JR having never born he was never pulled into the BarnesEwing feud He became a lawyer who was married to a woman who loved him for himself not his money and had two grown children He turns out to have become Vice President of the United States and at a party learns the President has suffered a stroke and he will be soon taking office

  Cliff appeared in the 1996 film  wherein after 5 years at Ewing Oil he decides he has had enough of the oil business and looks to sell Initially making a deal with West Star head Carter McKay he eventually sells the company to Bobby and Sue Ellen effectively ending the feud with JR when he decides that reuniting with his family Afton and his longlost daughter Pamela is more important than beating JR

  Cliff reappeared in the 2012 continuation of the series which picks up 20 years after the original series concluded and ignores the events of the two 1990s TV movies

  As the series begins Cliff is involved in a casino business He returns to Dallas and has a meeting with Bobby at Southfork Ranch Cliff wants to buy Southfork which Bobby has put up for sale JR walks in on their conversation and warns Cliff against trying to buy the Ewing family home Cliff later invites his adoptive nephew Christopher and his new wife Rebecca to dinner and expresses an interest in investing in Christophers energy project Christopher declines as he thinks that Cliff just wants to antagonize the Ewings again however Cliff warns him not to let the Ewings destroy him like they did his adoptive mother Pamela When JR arrives at Sue Ellens office to give her Miss Ellies pearls a good luck charm for her Texas gubernatorial campaign Cliff arrives to take Sue Ellen to lunch to discuss politics When questioned about trying to buy Southfork Cliff announces I will never stop fighting for what is rightfully mine

  In addition sometime between the end of the original series and the 2012 continuation Cliff Barnes started a new company Barnes Global which owns hundreds of subsidiaries in over fifty countries His desire to spite the Ewing family persists and Cliff eventually directs the bombing of a methaneextracting rig belonging to Ewing Energies which results in the deaths of Christopher and Rebeccas two unborn children As an aside no mention was ever made of the neurofibromatosis gene that Cliff carries Years before hed vowed never to have children because he feared they could die of the disease As the gene is passed from the carrier to their offspring the risk that Rebecca or her children could suffer is high

  The ensuing events result at the end of season two in the Ewings taking control of Barnes Global and folding it into a larger company known as Ewing Global with Cliff sitting in a Mexican jail charged with murdering JR Ewing However he managed to reach out to Elena Ramos and reveal more of JRs nefarious business tactics In a surprising twist he revealed to Elena her father had been fleeced out of the land JR managed to profit off of by having the deed to part of his familys land and her fathers land switched so Elenas father got the piece of land that lacked any oil As her father lost his life trying to find oil on it and her brother trafficked drugs to purchase the land back from the Ewings his revelation seemed to sway her He told Elena to make the Ewings pay for JRs sins against her family and gave her proxy over the onethird share of Barnes Global he still owned in the company

  It is revealed in the season one finale that Christophers wife known to him as Rebecca Sutter is actually Cliffs daughter Pamela known in the original series as Pamela Rebecca Cooper Cliff is shown to be behind Rebeccas attempt to hustle Christopher

  Although Pamela had discovered the Ewings had set up Cliff for the murder of JR she had chosen to leave Cliff in prison because he had blown up the rig and caused her to lose her unborn children She had however given him the deed to the land that Digger had deserved only at the expense of not being able to enjoy it Cliff was then left in prison

  Kercheval stated that had Dallas not been cancelled he wouldnt have been back for a fourth season

  A restaurant in Stockholms Vasastan district has operated under the name of the television character for at least two decades In the 1980s a German punk rock band went by the name Cliff Barnes and the Fear of Winning

  Foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration
  The foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration was the foreign policy of the United States during the two term Presidency of Bill Clinton 1993 to 2001 Clintons main foreign policy advisors were Secretaries of State Warren M Christopher 199396 followed by Madeleine Albright 19972001 in his second term The Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union had disintegrated under his predecessor President George H W Bush whom Clinton criticized for being too preoccupied with foreign affairs The United States was the only remaining superpower with a military strength far overshadowing the rest of the world Absent the Cold War Clintons main priority was always domestic affairs especially the domestic economy Foreignpolicy took a backseat except to promote American trade and during unexpected emergencies His emergencies had to do with humanitarian crises which raised the issue of American or NATO or United Nations interventions to protect civilians or armed humanitarian intervention as the result of civil war state collapse or oppressive governments

  President George H W Bush had sent American troops on a humanitarian mission to Somalia but 18 of them were killed and 80 wounded in a botched raid in October 1993 Public opinion and most elite opinion swung heavily against foreign interventions that risked the lives of American soldiers when American national interests were not directly involved That meant humanitarian missions were problematic Clinton agreed and sent Ground troops only once to Haiti where none were hurt He sent the Air Force to do massive bombing in the former Yugoslavia but no American crewmen were lost The major trouble spots during his two terms were in Africa Somalia and Rwanda and Eastern Europe Bosnia Herzegovina and Kosovo in the former Yugoslavia Clinton also tried to resolve longrunning conflicts in Northern Ireland and the Middle East particularly the IsraeliPalestinian conflict
  As a campaigner for election Clinton promised to devote his main attention to domestic policy in contrast to What he called the overemphasis on foreign policies by his opponent George H W Bush On taking office he told his top advisers he could only spare one hour a week meeting with them However Clinton had attended attended graduate school in England and increasingly took a personal interest in foreign affairs especially in his second term His main foreign policy advisors were Secretaries of State Warren M Christopher and Madeleine Albright and National Security Advisors Anthony Lake and Sandy Berger Other key advisors include Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and Strobe Talbott who as Ambassador at large dealt with Russia and India

  Realizing that increasing international trade would supports Clintons highest priority of economic growth Secretary of Commerce Ronald H Brown led delegations of entrepreneurs businessmen and financiers to South Africa Mexico Saudi Arabia Jordan Israel the West Bank Gaza Egypt Russia Brazil Argentina and Chile China and Hong Kong Ireland India and Senegal He was on a trade mission to wartorn Yugoslavia in 1996 when they all died in an accidental plane crash A special prosecutor was appointed when it was alleged that contributions to the Democratic Party enabled one to join the trade party Over its eight years in office the administration signed 300 trade agreements with other countries
  The Chinese communist regime had crushed the prodemocracy movement at Tiananmen Square in 1989 President Bush voiced American outrage but quietly reassured the Chinese that trade would continue In the 1992 election campaign Clinton criticized Bush for not punishing China However when Clinton took office himself he continued the Bush policies Clintons highest priority was to maintain trade with China boost American exports expand investment in the huge Chinese market and create more jobs at home By granting China temporary most favoured nation status in 1993 his administration minimized tariff levels in Chinese imports Clinton initially conditioned extension of this status on Chinese human rights reforms but ultimately decided to extend the status despite a lack of reform

  In 1998 Clinton paid a friendly nineday visit to China Albright defended the trip by saying Engagement does not mean endorsement In 1999 Clinton signed a landmark trade agreement with China The agreementthe result of more than a decade of negotiationswould lower many trade barriers between the two countries making it easier to export US products such as automobiles banking services and motion pictures The Chinese citizens ability to afford and purchase US goods should have been taken into consideration However the agreement could only take effect if China was accepted into the WTO and was granted permanent normal trade relations status by the US Congress Under the pact the United States would support Chinas membership in the WTO Many Democrats as well as Republicans were reluctant to grant permanent status to China because they were concerned about human rights in the country and the impact of Chinese imports on US industries and jobs Congress however voted in 2000 to grant permanent normal trade relations with China In 2000 Clinton signed a bill granting permanent normal trade relations to China and American imports from China massively increased in the subsequent years Clintons last treasury secretary Lawrence Summers argued that Clintons trade policies were technically the largest tax cut in the history of the world in that they reduced prices on consumer goods by lowering tariffs

  In 1993 Clinton worked with a bipartisan coalition in Congress to overcome objections by labor union and liberal Democrats They passed the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA that Bush had negotiated with Canada and Mexico in 1992 It joined the American Mexican and Canadian economies in a free trade pact It removed many restrictions of trade in agriculture textiles and automobiles provided new protections for intellectual property set up dispute resolution mechanisms and implemented new labor and environmental safeguards NAFTA cost jobs at first but in the long run it dramatically increased the trade among the three countries It increased the number of jobs in the United States but unions complained that it lowered wage rates for some workers However unions blocked his 1997 and 1998 proposals to provide the president with the power to quickly negotiate trade liberalization pacts with limited congressional comment Clintons advocacy of trade agreements sparked a backlash on the left among opponents of globalization A 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle Washington was overshadowed by major protests that descended into violence

  The end of superpower rivalry had freed the UN and NATO and regional security institutions from their previous Cold War mindset and created new opportunities for them to play a more active collective role Despite international norms of state sovereignty and nonintervention the idea that the international community should intervene in a country for the good of its own people gained greater legitimacy International organizations such as the UN and regional security such as NATO the OAS and the OAU would play a role in bestowing legitimacy on the operations and in organizing a collective response Domestically however these new developments at the international level became enmeshed with a longstanding struggle between Congress and the president over war powers and differences in treaties between domestic and international understandings of the term Which branch of government was to control the deployment of American troops occupied these debates almost as much as the merits of the individual interventions These debates were not new with the struggle over war powers being a constant feature of American foreign policy especially since WWII when it first gained superpower status joined international organizations and signed its first mutual defense treaty in more that 150 years Clinton would utilize both the multinational cast and the explicit blessing of international organizations for support in most of these involvements These largely humanitarian operations during his term met much more congressional opposition and enjoyed less frequent congressional authorization than did operations during the Cold War This involvement suggests that the president had found international organizations to be a useful ally in part to decrease and to overcome the resistance of the national legislature

  Just weeks before Clinton took office President George H W Bush had deployed American soldiers to Somalia a coastal nation on the Horn of Africa where people were suffering and dying from starvation and civil war The soldiers were sent to guard food and other relief supplies from being stolen by warring factions After soldiers faced fire from armed clans and 19 soldiers were killed in 1993 in the Battle of Mogadishu the mission quickly lost popularity with the American people Fearing chaos resulting in the starvation of Somalias civilians and to help US Forces defend themselves Clinton increased troop presence in the country Demands for withdrawal however grew louder and Clinton ordered troops out of the country in March 1994 This left Somalia in a state of chaos with warlords battling for control Public and elite opinion became strongly opposed to sending American ground troops on combat missions and Clinton agreed He did send ground troops to Haiti but none were engaged in combat He sent the Air Force into Yugoslavia for largescale bombing raids but no crewmen were lost

  In April 1994 genocide in Rwanda erupted due to a longstanding conflict between the majority Hutu and dominant Tutsi ethnic groups In little more than 100 days Hutu militia massacred about 800000 Tutsi men women and children The small UN force on the scene was helpless European nations flew in to remove their own nationals then Flew out There was a strong consensus in the United States at both the elite and popular levels that the United States should not send in largescale combat forces to stop the massacres American officials avoided the word genocide because that would justify military intervention Clinton later called his inaction his worst mistake

  The Hutu militia were highly effective in killing Tutu civilians but they were ineffective when a large Tutu armed force based in neighboring Uganda invaded in July seized full control of the entire nation of Rwanda By the end of July 1994 nearly two million Hutus fled the country for safety flooding into refugee camps in neighboring countries As many thousands of refugees died of disease and starvation Clinton ordered airdrops of food and supplies for the Hutu refugees including known genocidaires In July he sent 200 noncombatant troops to the Rwanda capital of Kigali to manage the airport and distribute relief supplies These troops were withdrawn by October 1994 Clinton and the United Nations faced criticism for their nonresponse to the genocide When Clinton traveled to Africa in 1998 he said that the international community presumably including the US must accept responsibility for the failure to respond to the massacres When speaking about the Rwanda Crisis Clinton called it his worst failure admitting I blew it During his African trip Clinton also referred to the concept of the new generation of African leaders

  In August 1998 terrorists bombed the United States embassies in the capitals of two East African countries Nairobi Kenya and Dar es Salaam Tanzania About 250 people were killed including 12 Americans and more than 5500 were injured After intelligence linked the bombings to Osama bin Laden a wealthy Saudi Arabian living in Afghanistan who was suspected of terrorist activity Clinton ordered missile attacks on sites in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the bombings at the US embassies and to deter future terrorist attacks The Clinton administration maintained that the sitesa pharmaceutical factory at Khartoum the capital of Sudan and several alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistanwere involved in terrorist activities

  Much of Clintons reluctant focus was the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina a nation in southeastern Europe that had declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1992 The Bush administration decided with the Cold War over Yugoslavia was no longer a high American priority Trouble there could be less left to Europe to handle But Clinton was outraged by the humanitarian disaster and decided to play a role This declaration was the catalyst of a war between Bosnian Serbs who wanted Bosnia to remain in the Yugoslav federation and Bosnian Muslims and Croats The Bosnian Serbs who were supported by Serbia were better equipped than the Muslims and the Croats as a result they populated and controlled much of the countryside in ways including besieging cities such as the capital of Sarajevo This caused widespread suffering and in response

  In early 1993 the Clinton administration decided on aggressive action ignoring both the United Nations and key European allies The proposed policy was called lift and strike The plan was to lift the arms embargo the UN had imposed on all sides which left the Bosnian Muslims unarmed The US would arm them so they could defend themselves until they were fully prepared to fight for themselves the US would hit the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes to keep them back Christopher traveled to Europe to win support from Britain France and Germany but they were all staunchly opposed By the time Christopher returned to Washington support for the plan had evaporated based on memories of Vietnam and fears of being plunged into a chaotic war with no end in sight In 1994 Clinton opposed an effort by the Republicans in Congress to lift the arms embargo as it were because American allies were still resistant to that policy

  Clinton continued to pressure western European countries throughout 1994 to take strong measures against the Serbs But in November as the Serbs seemed on the verge of defeating the Muslims and Croats in several strongholds Clinton changed course and called for conciliation with the Serbs After the 2nd Markale massacre in which Bosnian Serb forces reportedly shelled a crowded marketplace in Sarajevo NATO led by the United States launched Operation Deliberate Force with a series of airstrikes against Bosnian Serb targets In July 1995 as the tide of war was turning against the Bosnian Serbs local Bosnian forces under the command of General Ratko Mladi forced the surrender of the Bosnian stronghold of Srebrenica near the eastern border with Serbia A small UN force was helpless and the defenders surrendered with the promise that no civilians or soldiers would be harmed if they surrendered Instead Mladis forces massacred over 7000 Bosnians It was the worst massacre in Europe In 40 years and galvanized NATO Intervention The escalating air campaign along with a counteroffensive by betterequipped Muslim and Croatian forces succeeded in pressuring the Bosnian Serbs into participating in negotiations In November 1995 Clinton hosted peace talks between the warring parties in Dayton Ohio The parties reached a peace agreement known as the Dayton Agreement leaving Bosnia as a single state made up of two separate entities with a central government In 2011 Serbia was forced to turn over Mladi to the United Nations and in 2017 he was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of genocide

  According to historian David N Gibbs

  In the spring of 1998 ethnic tension in the Federal Republic of Yugoslaviathe state formed from the former Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegroheightened when the military forces responded in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija More than 90 percent of the residents of Kosovo were Muslim and ethnic Albanians many of whom wanted independence from the country Yugoslav forces were mobilized into province to quell Albanian rebels

  Through attempting to impose the Rambouillet Agreement Clinton who strongly supported the Albanians threatened the Yugoslav administration with military strikes On 24 March 1999 NATO led by the United States launched the twomonth bombardment of Yugoslavia The strikes were not limited to military installations and NATO targets included civilian targets such as factories oil refineries television stations and various infrastructure The intervention which devastated Yugoslavia was not approved by the UN General Assembly or the UN Security Council and was strongly opposed by both Russia and China It was the first time in NATOs history that its forces had attacked a sovereign country and the first time in which air power alone won a battle In June 1999 NATO and Yugoslav military leaders approved an international peace plan for Kosovo and attacks were suspended after Yugoslav forces withdrew from Kosovo

  Clinton also sought to end the conflict in Northern Ireland by arranging a peace agreement between the nationalist and unionist factions In 1998 former Senator George Mitchellwhom Clinton had appointed to assist in peace talkssupported an accord that became known as the Good Friday Agreement It called for the British Parliament to devolve legislative and executive authority of the province to a new Northern Ireland Assembly whose Executive would include members of both communities Years of stalemate have followed the agreement mainly due to the refusal of the Provisional Irish Republican Army IRA a nationalist paramilitary group to decommission its weapons for some years and after that the refusal of the Democratic Unionist Party to push the process forward Mitchell returned to the region and arranged yet another blueprint for a further peace settlement that resulted in a December 1999 formation of the powersharing government agreed the previous year which was to be followed by steps toward the IRAs disarmament That agreement eventually faltered as well although Clinton continued peace talks to prevent the peace process from collapsing completely In 2005 the IRA decommissioned all of its arms and in 2007 Sinn Fin expressed a willingness to support the reformed Police Service of Northern Ireland PSNI Power was restored to the Assembly in May 2007 marking renewed promise for the fulfillment of the Good Friday Agreement

  Clinton was likewise deeply involved in the Middle East peace process to negotiate peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians as well as with the governments of Egypt Jordan Syria and Lebanon Secret negotiations mediated by Clinton between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat led to a historic declaration of peace in September 1993 called the Oslo Accords Clinton personally arranged for the peace accord to be signed at the White House on September 13 1993 The agreement allowed a limited Palestinian selfrule in the Israelioccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip Following up after Oslo Secretary of State Christopher encouraged Jordans King Hussein to make a peace treaty with Israel Christopher offered Hussein 200 million in military equipment and 700 million in debt forgiveness to sweeten the deal On October 27 1994 Rabin and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdelsalam alMajali signed the IsraelJordan peace treaty It was the second piece treaty for Israel after Egypt Christopher sought to obtain a Third treaty between Rabin and Syrian President Hafez alAssad but to no avail

  The 1993 and 1995 peace agreements between Israel and Palestine however did not end the conflict in the Middle East As the peace process came to a stall Clinton invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to peace talks on the Wye River in October 1998 The two leaders signed yet another agreement known as the Wye River Memorandum which called for Israel to transfer more territory in the West Bank to the Palestinians In return the Palestinians agreed to take steps to curb terrorism They also agreed to a timetable to negotiate a final resolution of the Palestinian fight for an independent state

  After an abrupt outbreak of violence sparked by the agreement however Netanyahu refused to cede any more West Bank territory and placed new demands upon Palestine His ceding of territory had shaken his own coalition though and together with other factors this contributed to the downfall of the Netanyahu government in Israel As a result in May 1999 Israelis elected Ehud Barak the leader of a political coalition that favored resuming the peace process to replace Netanyahu as prime minister Clinton continued to work passionately on negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians Throughout his last year in office Clinton came close to arranging a final peace settlement but failed according to Clinton as a result of Arafats reluctance Clinton related a phone conversation he had with Arafat three days before he left office You are a great man Arafat said Clinton replied The hell I am Im a colossal failure and you made me one

  Clinton was also confronted with problems in Iraq In 1991 two years before Clinton became president the United States under President George H W Bush participated in the Persian Gulf War to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation In 1991 the warring parties signed a ceasefire agreement and the United Nations Security Council passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 requiring Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction and allow inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission UNSCOM to monitor the countrys adherence to the agreement In addition to UN inspections to ensure the Iraqi compliance of Resolution 688 which called for Iraq to end its oppression of Iraqi citizens the nofly zones over Iraq were established by the US and its allies to protect the Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and the Shiites in southern Iraq from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government

  On June 26 1993 Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack on the Iraqi Intelligence Services IIS principal command and control complex in Baghdad publicly announced as retaliation for the assassination attempt by the IIS on former President George H W Bush while he was visiting Kuwait in April of that year to commemorate a coalition victory over Iraq in the Gulf War Fourteen cruise missiles were launched from and nine of them launched from  Sixteen hit the target while three struck a residential area killing nine civilians and wounding 12 others Four missiles were unaccounted for This strike was in violation of international law although that point is contentious

  In October 1994 Baghdad once again began mobilizing around 64000 Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border because of their expressed frustrations of economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations Security Council UNSC In response the US begins to deploy troops in the Persian Gulf to deter Iraqi aggression against Kuwait Codenamed Operation Vigilant Warrior 1st Brigade of the Fort Stewart Georgiabased 24th Infantry Division Mechanized deployed and drew prepositioned equipment in Kuwait The 23rd Wings Flying Tigers 75th Fighter Squadron Tigersharks and its full complement of A10s initially deployed from Pope AFB North Carolina to Dhahran Air Base Saudi Arabia followed by the first forward deployment to Ahmad alJaber Air Base Kuwait This allowed better facetoface coordination with tactical air control parties TACP assets further forward deployed at Camp Doha Kuwait and points north Iraq would later withdraw troops near the Kuwaiti border in response to a massive US military buildup This served to increase US and Coalition resolve to contain Iraqi aggression against their neighbors in the Middle East

  In September 1996 Clinton ordered Operation Desert Strike and ships from the Battle Group including  and  in conjunction with B52 bombers escorted by F14D Tomcats from USS Carl Vinson launched 27 cruise missiles against Iraqi air defense targets in southern Iraq A second wave of 17 was launched later that day The missiles hit targets in and around Kut Iskandariyah Nasiriyah and Tallil This was done in response to Saddam Hussein an Iraqi dictator attempting to launch an Iraqi military offensive campaign in the Kurdish town of Arbil in Iraqi Kurdistan

  In his 1998 State of the Union Address Clinton warned the US Congress of Husseins possible pursuit of nuclear weapons saying

  The UNSCOM team faced resistance from Iraq which blocked inspections and hid deadly germ agents and warheads Clinton then threatened military action several times when Hussein who turned out to be Iraqs President tried stalling the UNSCOM inspections To weaken Husseins grip of power Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act into law on October 31 1998 which instituted a policy of regime change against Iraq though it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces Between December 16 and 19 1998 Clinton ordered fourday period of concentrated air attacks against military installations in Iraq This was in response to Saddams refusal to cooperate with UN inspectors After the bombing Hussein blocked any further UN inspections and announced its attempt to shoot down Coalition aircraft in the nofly zones over Iraq For several years afterward US and Coalition aircraft routinely attacked hostile Iraqi defense installations in Iraq in response to what the Clinton administration claimed were provocations by the Iraqi military including antiaircraft fire and radar locks on US and Coalition aircraft

  The UN sanctions against Iraq that the United Nations Security Council imposed after the Gulf War remained in place during the Clinton administration These sanctions were alleged to have contributed to increased child mortality there although this was disputed Albright later wrote Saddam Hussein could have prevented any child from suffering simply by meeting his obligations Recent research has shown that commonly cited data were fabricated by the Iraqi government and that there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after 1990 and during the period of the sanctions

  President Clintons foreign policy team initially viewed Iran with suspicion and sought to contain Iranian ambitions as part of the dual containment strategy On May 6 1995 Clinton signed Executive Order 12957 which implemented tight oil and trade sanctions on Iran and made it illegal for American corporations or their foreign subsidiaries to participate in any contract for the financing of the development of petroleum resources located in Iran On May 6 1995 President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 which banned almost all trade between US businesses and the Iranian government with the exception of informational materials
  A year before the President declared that Iran was a state sponsor of terrorism and a rogue state marking the first time that an American President used that term

  In 1996 the Clinton administration agreed to compensate the Iranian government for the deaths of 254 Iranians in a 1988 incident in which an Iranian commercial passenger plane was shot down by mistake by an American warship the USS Vincennes In Clintons second term as President beginning in 1997 the administration began to take a softer approach towards Iran particularly after the election of reformist Mohammad Khatami as President of Iran

  In 1995 Albright and Clinton mandated what could be considered an apology to the Iranian people for the 1953 CIAassisted coup that overthrew the Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh and replaced him with the Shah Albright and Clinton also acknowledged that the USbacked government of the Shah oppressed political opponents In the months that followed an Iranian professional wrestling team was allowed entry into the US to face American teams and a significant increase in cultural and academic overtures were made between the two countries In 1998 Iran and the United States faced each other in a game at the FIFA World Cup that year Iran beat the US by 21 Khatami also encouraged Americans to travel to Iran for vacational purposes citing the city of Esfahan a popular location for tourists where according to CNN several wellpreserved sites often surprise tourists In a wellpublicized 1997 interview Khatami refused to fully apologize for the 79 hostage crisis in which 52 American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days yet did offer to open up a dialogue with the American people

  Clinton at one point offered to open up an official dialogue with the Iranian government and renew diplomatic relations with the country after 20 years of no such relations However Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refused to accept the offer for dialogue unless the US formally withdrew its support for Israel lifted the 95 sanctions imposed on the country stopped accusing Tehran of attempting to develop nuclear weaponry and officially ended its policy of considering Iran a rogue state that sponsors terrorism Although Clinton did privately weigh the idea of revoking the executive orders he signed in the spring of 1995 the administration refused to comply with Irans other demands

  Eventually President Clinton did ease restrictions on export of food and medical equipment to Iran Albright announced in 2000 that the US would begin to enable Americans to purchase and import carpets and food products such as dried fruits nuts and caviar from Iran and also was confident that Iran would provide cooperation with the United States in the battle against narcotics and international drug abuse In 1995 the State Department warned US citizens against traveling in Iran due to that governments rampant antiAmericanism yet five years later Albright decided to repeal this warning

  By the time Clinton left office in January 2001 it was clear that relations between Iran and the United States had significantly cooled despite the fact that President Khatami and President Clinton failed to initiate an official diplomatic dialogue between the nations something which has not existed since the 1979 hostage crisis

  In 1994 the Clinton administration announced that it was lifting the trade embargo on Vietnam citing progress on the Vietnam War POWMIA issue regarding the search for American soldiers listed as missing in action and the remains of those killed in action as well as the market reforms that Vietnam implemented from 1986 On July 10 1995 Clinton announced that his administration was restoring full diplomatic relations with Vietnam citing the continued progress in determining the whereabouts of MIAs and locating the remains of soldiers killed in the Vietnam War Clinton nonetheless stressed that the search for Americans would continue especially for the soldiers listed as discrepancies namely 55 American soldiers believed to still be alive when they went missing On November 16 2000 Clinton arrived in Hanoi with his wife Senatorelect Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea shortly before his second term in office ended The next day Clinton spoke to the Vietnamese people publicly about both the conflict as well as the promise renewed relations meant

  In 1995 tense relations with China and the imprisonment of an innocent American in the Communist nation led to pressure for the US to boycott the 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing The US delegation chaired by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Madeleine Albright then the United States Ambassador to the United Nations was assigned with the task of confronting China about its human rights abuses but not so strongly as to damage sensitive relations Hillary Rodham Clinton gave a successful speech before the entire Chinese leadership and the Conference where she without bringing up China or any particular nation attacked human rights abuses against humanity in general and women and girls in particular

  In 199596 the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis happened between Taiwan and China Chinese concerns about the upcoming Taiwanese presidential election as well as the possibility of the declaration of Taiwanese independence led to a series of missile tests right off the coast of Taiwan that could have escalated out of control The Clinton administration responded in March 1996 by staging the biggest display of American military might in Asia since the Vietnam War Numerous aircraft carrier groups were stationed near Taiwan and her group as well as sailed through the Taiwan Strait in a demonstration of support for Taiwan Eventually a ceasefire was declared and China declared the missile tests to be completed

  North Koreas feared aim to create nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles was a serious problem for the Clinton Administration In 1994 North Korea a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty refused to allow international inspectors to review two nuclear waste sites The inspectors wanted to see if North Korea was in violation of the treaty since they were suspected of reprocessing spent fuel into plutonium which could be used to manufacture nuclear weapons Despite diplomatic pressure and repeated warnings by Clinton North Korea refused to allow the inspections and even raised the prospect of war with South Korea an ally of the United States In 1994 Clinton also considered a US military strike on bombing the Yongbyon nuclear reactor He was advised that if war broke out it could cost 52000 US and 490000 South Korean military casualties in the first three months as well as a large number of civilian casualties
  With private diplomacy by former president Jimmy Carter the Clinton administration reached a breakthrough with North Korea in October 1994 when North Korea agreed to shut down the nuclear plants that could produce materials for weapons if the United States would help North Korea build plants that generated electricity with lightwater nuclear reactors These reactors would be more efficient and their waste could not easily be used for nuclear weaponry The United States also agreed to supply fuel oil for electricity until the new plants were built and North Korea agreed to allow inspection of the old waste sites when construction began on the new plants KEDO was established based on this agreement in 1995

  This 1994 Agreed Framework as it was known kept the Yongbyon plutonium enrichment plant closed and under international inspection until 2002 However economic supports by the agreement and KEDO gave an advantage to North Korea and North Korea broke off from the treaty and restarted plutonium production In October 2006 North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon President Bush warned that he was not pleased by such actions as it is he invited the international community to take a stand As a result North Korea the United States Russia China were involved in negotiations and North Korea agreed to close down their nuclear station temporarily

  The 1991 Haitian coup dtat led by Lieutenant General Raoul Cdras had ousted the countrys elected president JeanBertrand Aristide who barely escaped to the United States Shortly thereafter tens of thousands of Haitians also tried to flee to the United States in leaky boats in 1993 increased opposition to Aristide supporters would increase these numbers Relatively few refugees would be allowed legal entry with most being sent back to Haiti or Guantanamo by the United States Coast Guard Clinton had previously criticized former President George H W Bush for doing much the same

  American opinion generally favored Aristide but opposed military intervention Clinton was highly sensitive to his black constituency and the black leadership in Congress pushed for action Vice President Gore and advisor Anthony Lake strongly agreed while Sandy Berger Strobe Talbott Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry went along Clinton agreed but worried about going against the democratic will in his own country to enforce democracy in some other country On September 15 1994 Clinton tried to rally American public opinion with a forceful televised address from the Oval Office He denounced the military junta as armed thugs engaged in a reign of terror executing children raping women killing priests Clinton demanded it leave immediately As American warplanes were being readied for an invasion suddenly former President Jimmy Carter proposed to negotiate a settlement Clinton agreed that Carter Colin Powell and Senator Sam Nunn would fly to Haiti to convince the junta to leave In a matter of 48 hours Carters group achieved the desired transfer of power without any violence In Operation Uphold Democracy American forces landed after the departure of the junta Anthony Lake attributed the success to a combination of power and diplomacy Without Clintons threat of force the junta would never have left Without Carter there would have been fighting Aristide returned to power and Clintons prestige was enhanced Nevertheless six years later conditions were still terrible in Haiti

  After securing the NAFTA treaty that integrated the Mexican and American economies Clinton faced yet another foreign crisis in early 1995 The Mexican peso began to fall sharply and threatened the collapse of the Mexican economy Clinton feared that a collapse would have a negative impact on the United States because of their close economic ties He proposed a plan to address the financial crisis in Mexico but many in Congress hearting that constituents would not favor aid money to Mexico rejected the plan In response Clinton used executive authority to create a 20 billion loan package for Mexico to restore international confidence in the Mexican economy The loan Went through and Mexico completed its loan payments to the United States in January 1997 three years ahead of schedule However issues such as drug smuggling and immigration continued to strain relations

  American foreign policy toward Cuba had been hostile since Fidel Castro aligned the country with the Soviet Union in 1960 Clinton basically continue the policy especially regarding trade embargoes but he faced a difficult problem on what to do with Cuban refugees trying to reach asylum in the United States

  After negotiations with representatives of the Cuban government Clinton revealed in May 1995 a controversial policy reversing the decadesold policy of automatically granting asylum to Cuban refugees Approximately 20000 Cuban refugees detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba were to be admitted to the United States over a period of three months In order to prevent a mass exodus of refugees to the United States all future refugees would be returned to Cuba The influx of refugees into Guantanamo Bay overwhelmed the facilities necessitating Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage involving Panama Clinton also implemented the wet footdry foot policy for Cuban refugees This policy meant that Cuban refugees caught at sea were returned to Cuba wet foot while Cuban refugees that made it to dry land dry foot were allowed to stay in the US This changed the refugees tactics from slow rafts to speed boats

  Relations between the United States and Cuba deteriorated in February 1996 when Cuba shot down two American civilian planes Cuba accused the planes of violating Cuban airspace Clinton tightened sanctions against Cuba and suspended charter flights from the United States to Cuba hoping this would cripple Cubas tourism industry

  In their response to the incident the US Congress passed the HelmsBurton Act in March 1996 The bill strengthened an embargo against imports of Cuban products Title III however made the bill controversial because it allowed American citizens whose property was seized during and after the 1959 Cuban Revolution to sue in American courts foreign companies that later invested in those properties Title III sparked an immediate uproar from countries such as Mexico Canada and members of the European Union because they believed that they would be penalized for doing business with Cuba In response Clinton repeatedly suspended Title III of the legislation the act gave the president the right to exercise this option every six months

  Clinton softened his Cuban policy in 1998 and 1999 In March 1998 at the urging of Pope John Paul II Clinton lifted restrictions and allowed humanitarian charter flights to resume He also took steps to increase educational religious and humanitarian contacts in Cuba The US government decided to allow Cuban citizens to receive more money from American friends and family members and to buy more American food and medicine

  On February 26 1993 thirtysix days after Clinton took office terrorists who the CIA would later reveal were working under the direction of Osama bin Laden detonated a timed car bomb in the parking garage below Tower One of the World Trade Center in New York City see the World Trade Center bombing Clinton responded by ordering his National Security Council under the direction of Anthony Lake and the FBI to find and punish those responsible The FBI was able to quickly identify the vehicle used in the bomb from a remnant found in the rubble a Ryder rental van which had been reported stolen in Jersey City New Jersey the day before The truck was rented by Mohammed Salameh whom the FBI immediately detained Similar evidence led to the arrests of other plotters behind the attack including Nidal Ayyad Mahmoud Abouhalima Ahmad Ajaj and Ramzi Yousefwho was identified as the key player in the bombing All men were tried and convicted for the bombing and other terrorists activities

  In his 1995 State of the Union address Clinton proposed comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists whether they strike at home or abroad He sent legislation to Congress to extend federal criminal jurisdiction make it easier to deport terrorists and act against terrorist fundraising Following the bombing of the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City Clinton amended that legislation to increase wiretap and electronic surveillance authority for the FBI require explosives to be equipped with traceable taggants and appropriate more funds to the FBI CIA and local police

  In June 1995 Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 39 which stated that the United States should deter defeat and respond vigorously to all terrorist attacks on our territory and against our citizens Furthermore it called terrorism both a matter of national security and a crime The implementation of his proposals led to a substantial increase in counterterrorism funds for the FBI and CIA

  In 1996 the CIA established a special unit of officers to analyze intelligence received about bin Laden and plan operations against him coined the Bin Laden Issue Station It was this unit that first realized bin Laden was more than just a terrorist financier but a leader of a global network with operations based in Afghanistan Given these findings the NSC encouraged the Department of State to pay more attention to Afghanistan and its governing unit the Taliban which had received funding from bin Laden The State Department requested the Taliban to expel bin Laden from the country noting that he was a sponsor of terrorism and publicly urged Muslims to kill Americans The Taliban responded that they did not know his whereabouts and even if they did he was not a threat to the United States The CIAs counterterrorism division quickly began drafting plans to capture and remove bin Laden from the country However Marine General Anthony Zinni and some in the State Department protested the move saying that the United States should focus instead on ending the Afghan civil war and the Talibans human rights abuses

  In 1998 Clinton appointed Richard Clarkewho until then served in a drugs and counterterrorism division of the CIAto lead an interagency comprehensive counterterrorism operation the Counterterrorism Security Group CSG The goal of the CSG was to detect deter and defend against terrorist attacks Additionally Clinton appointed Clarke to sit on the cabinetlevel Principals Committee when it met on terrorism issues

  Clintons Counterterrorism Center began drafting a plan to ambush bin Ladens compound in Kandahar The CIA mapped the compound and identified the houses of bin Ladens wives and the location where he most likely slept The plan was relatively simple at least on paper Tribals would subdue the guards enter the compound take bin Laden to a desert outside Kandahar and hand him over to another group of tribals This second group would carry him to a desert landing stripwhich had already been testedwhere a CIA plane would take him to New York for arraignment When they completed a draft plan they ran through two rehearsals in the United States Confident that the plan would work the Counterterrorism Center of the CIA sought the approval of the White House While they acknowledged that the plan was risky they stated that there was a risk in not acting because sooner or later bin Laden will attack US interests perhaps using WMD

  Clarke reviewed the plans for Sandy Berger the National Security Director and told him that it was in the very early stages of development and stressed the importance of only targeting bin Laden not the entire compound The NSC told the CIA to begin preparing the necessary legal documents to execute the raid

  The senior management of the CIA was skeptical of the plan and despite objections canceled the operation fearing that the risk to their operatives and financial costs were too high It is unclear whether or not Clinton was aware of the plan

  As the Counterterrorism Center continued to track bin Laden they learned in 1998 that the Saudi government had bin Laden cells within the country that were planning attacks on US forces CIA Director George Tenet encouraged by the Saudis show of force against bin Laden asked them to assist in the fight against bin Laden Clinton named Tenet as his informal personal representative to work with Saudi Arabia on terrorism The Saudis promised Tenet that they would do everything they could to convince the Taliban to release bin Laden for trial in America or elsewhere The Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal held various meetings with Taliban chief Mullah Omar and other leaders and received assurance that bin Laden would be removed Omar however reneged on that promise

  On August 7 1998 Bin Laden struck again this time with simultaneous bombings on the US embassies in Nairobi Kenya and Dar es Salaam Tanzania see above The CIA having confirmed bin Laden was behind the attack informed Clinton that terrorist leaders were planning to meet at a camp near Khowst to plan future attacks According to Tenet several hundred including bin Laden would attend On August 20 Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on AlQaeda terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum Sudan where bin Laden was suspected of manufacturing biological weapons While the military hit their targets bin Laden was not killed The CIA estimated that they had missed bin Laden by a few hours

  At the time of the attacks Clinton was embroiled in the Lewinsky scandal see below This led many Republicans in Congress to accuse the president of wagging the doglaunching a military attack simply to distract the public from his personal problems Clinton and his principals however insist that the decision was made solely on the basis of national security

  After the attacks failed Clinton moved his focus to diplomatic pressure On the advice of the State Department Clinton encouraged Pakistan whose military intelligence agency was a patron of the Taliban to pressure the Taliban to remove bin Laden After numerous meetings with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif the Pakistanis would still not cooperate Sharif eventually agreed to allow the United States to train Pakistani special forces to find bin Laden When Sharif was ousted by Pervez Musharraf the plan was abandoned

  After encouragement by Richard Clarke Clinton issued an executive order in July 1999 declaring the Taliban regime as a state sponsor of terrorism This was followed in October 1999 by Resolution 1267 sponsored by the United States placing economic and travel sanctions on the Taliban The Taliban however stood by bin Laden and the United States along with Russia proposed yet another UN resolution Resolution 1333 this time imposing an embargo an arms shipments to the Taliban The move was meant to weaken the Taliban in their fight against the Northern Alliance in their civil strife However the resolution did little to limit the illegal flow of arms from Pakistan

  In August 1999 Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification ordering the CIA to develop another plan to capture bin Laden and giving the CIA the authority to order bin Laden be killed

  Near the end of 1999 the Clinton administration working with the government of Jordan detected and thwarted a planned terrorist attack to detonate bombs at various New Year millennium celebrations around the world The CIA confirmed that bin Laden was behind the plot which was disrupted just days before the New Year While many credited Clintons new CSG for playing a role in the foiling of these plots critics claim it was mostly luck

  The CIA informed Clinton that they feared the thwarted attacks were just part of a larger series of attacks planned for the new year Clinton asked Clarke and the CSG to draft plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda attacks

  On October 12 2000 terrorists bombed USS Cole in the harbor of the Yemeni port of Aden The attack on  a US Navy destroyer killed 17 Navy sailors and there was no clear indication during the last months of Clintons term of who was responsible The CIA reported that they had no definitive answer on the crucial question of outside direction of the attackhow and by whom Clinton did not think it would be wise to launch an attack based on a preliminary judgment stating that he would have taken further action had he received definitive intelligence The CIA was eventually able to confirm bin Ladens involvement with certainty a week after the Bush administration took office

  As Clintons second term drew to a close the CSG drafted a comprehensive policy paper entitled Strategy for Eliminating the Threat from the Jihadist Networks of al Qida Status and Prospects The paper outlined a method to roll back al Qaeda over a period of three to five years Clarke stated that while continued antial Qida operations at the current level will prevent some attacks it will not seriously attrit their ability to plan and conduct attacks This policy paper was forwarded to the incoming Bush administration

  In the years since September 11 2001 Clinton has been subject to criticism that he failed to capture Osama bin Laden as President In a September 24 2006 interview with Fox News Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday Clinton challenged his critics According to Clinton he faced criticism from various conservatives during his administration for being too obsessed with Bin Laden Clinton also noted that his administration created the first comprehensive antiterrorist operation led by Richard Clarkewhom Clinton accuses the Bush Administration of demoting Clinton also said he worked hard to try to kill Bin Laden Former international negotiator and current businessman financier and media commentator Mansoor Ijaz claimed that from 19961998 he had opened up unofficial negotiations with Sudan to lift terrorism sanctions from that country in exchange for intelligence information about the terrorist groups Islamic Jihad Hezbollah and Hamas He claimed that Sudan was also prepared to offer custody of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden who had been living in the country and launching operations According to Ijaz neither Clinton nor National Security Advisor Sandy Berger responded to the situation Bin Laden later left Sudan and established his operations in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban and with his network planned out terrorist attacks against American interests worldwide including attacks on American embassies in Tunisia and Sudan as well as the bombing of USS Cole The most infamous were the attacks of September 11 2001 that occurred under Clintons successor George W Bush nine months after Clinton left office However the 911 Commission Report later found no credible evidence to support the Sudan custody offer as the American Ambassador to the Sudan had no legal basis to ask for custody due to no indictment against Bin Laden

  Sudans minister of defense Fatih Erwa has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the United States The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since at the time there was no indictment outstanding

  Clinton acknowledged that following the bombing on USS Cole his administration prepared battle plans to execute a military operation in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and search for bin Laden The plans were never implemented because according to Clinton the CIA and FBI refused to certify that bin Laden was responsible for the bombing until after he left office and the military was unable to receive basing rights in Uzbekistan In relation to Afghanistan Clinton criticized the Bush Administration when he said We do have a government that thinks Afghanistan is oneseventh as important as Iraq Clinton also said that his administration left the plans and a comprehensive antiterror strategy with the new Bush Administration in January 2001

  In 2014 a September 10 2001 audio containing Clintons conservation at a business center at Melbourne Australia 10 hours before the 911 attacks regarding the topic of terrorism was revealed In this audio Clinton stated that according to intelligence agencies Bin Laden was located in Kandahar Afghanistan in December 1998 and thus a missile strike was proposed However he decided not to kill Bin Laden because of conflicting reports of intelligence information to his true whereabouts as well as the potential risk for civilian casualties He stated that Im just saying you know if I were Osama bin Ladenhes a very smart guy Ive spent a lot of time thinking about himand I nearly got him once And then he said that I nearly got him And I could have killed him but I would have to destroy a little town called Kandahar in Afghanistan and kill 300 innocent women and children and then I would have been no better than him And so I didnt do it

  In 1996 Clinton signed the United States onto the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT a landmark international agreement that prohibited all signatory nations from testing nuclear weapons The following year he sent the treaty to the Senate for ratification Conservative Republicans took the lead in defeating the treaty in October 1999 by vote of 48 in favor and 51 against far short of the two thirds It needed to pass International reaction to the Senates action was uniformly negative and the rejection was a political setback for Clinton who had lobbied actively for its approval One scholar blames the failure on

  Despite the rejection of the treaty Clinton promised that the United States would continue to maintain a policy of not testing nuclear weapons which had been in place since 1992

  Throughout the 1990s the Congress refused to appropriate funds for the United States to pay its dues to the United Nations By 1999 the United States owed the UN at least 1 billion in back dues That same year Clinton reached a compromise with Republicans in Congress to submit more than 800 million in back dues Republicans in the House of Representatives had insisted that UN debt repayments be accompanied by restrictions on US funding for international groups that lobbied for abortion rights in foreign countries Clinton had vetoed similar measures in the past but he agreed to the restrictions when faced with the prospect that the United States would lose its vote in the UN General Assembly for nonpayment of dues

  During his first term argues two political scientists

  Public opinion in the United States about the role the country should have in the Bosnian genocide was negative A series of Gallup polls through 19951997 showed that public disapproval of military intervention in Bosnia hovered around 52 with the only outlier occurring in January 1997 where 58 of the population disapproved The polls also found that public opposition was bipartisan with 49 of Republicans and around 40 of Democrats and Independents disapproving

  Americans were even less supportive of involvement in Kosovo A Gallup poll in March 1999 showed that about half of the American public supported NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia That was the weakest support for any American combat mission in the past decade Fewer people were following the news about US involvement in Kosovo falling from 43 to 32 in two months

  The public and the media paid little attention to the Rwanda genocide One reason why the United States did not enter Rwanda is because of the public reluctance to enter combat after the Vietnam War

 <doc id="7737010" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737010" title="Androgen replacement therapy">
  Androgen replacement therapy
  Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

  ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

  Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

  The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

  Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

  The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

  On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

  There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

  Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

  Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

  As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

  In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

  A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

  Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

  The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

  The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

  The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

  Pterodactyloidea
  Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

  Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

  In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

  Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

  A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

  There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
  Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

  Fernando Castro Pacheco
  Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

  Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

  Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

  While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

  In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

  Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

  Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

  After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

  Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

  After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

  The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

  To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

  Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

  To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

  Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

  As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

  One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

  Nathalia Crane
  Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

  After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

  Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

  Texas State Highway Loop 150
  Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

  The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

  In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

  Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

 <doc id="7737240" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737240" title="Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate">
  Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

  In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

  The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

  Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

  The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

  Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

  Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

  In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

  This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

  When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

  In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

  In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

  In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

  Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

  The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

  There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

  In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

  As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

  As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

  On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release

  Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

  IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

  In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

  Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses

  To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

  Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

  Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

  NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

  Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

  An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

  The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

  Pleasant Plains New Jersey
  Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

  Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

  An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

  Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

  Peristimulus time histogram
  In neurophysiology peristimulus time histogram and poststimulus time histogram both abbreviated PSTH or PST histogram are histograms of the times at which neurons fire It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram and poststimulus and peristimulus are often hyphenated

  The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

  To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram


  The optimal bin size assuming an underlying Poisson point process  is a minimizer of the formula 2kv
  where k and v are mean and variance of k

  Oklahomas 2nd congressional district
  Oklahomas Second Congressional District is one of five United States Congressional districts in Oklahoma and covers approximately onefourth of the state in the east The district borders Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Texas and includes in whole or in part a total of 24 counties

  Historically the district has supported conservative Democrats and was reckoned as a classic Yellow Dog Democrat district However the growing Republican trend in the state has overtaken the district since the start of the 21st century In the last two elections the Republican presidential candidate has carried it by the largest margin in the state Urban voters represent a third of the district

  The district is represented by Republican Markwayne Mullin becoming only the second Republican after Tom Coburn to hold the seat since 1921

  The district borders Kansas to the north Missouri and Arkansas to the east and Texas along the Red River to the south It covers all or part of 26 counties It includes the remainder of Rogers County including the county seat of Claremore that is not included in the 1st District and then also all of the following counties Adair Nowata Craig Ottawa Mayes Delaware Cherokee Okmulgee Muskogee Sequoyah Okfuskee McIntosh Haskell LeFlore Hughes Pittsburg Latimer Coal Atoka Pushmataha McCurtain Choctaw Bryan Marshall and Johnston

  Some of the principal cities in the district include Miami Claremore Muskogee Tahlequah Okmulgee McAlester and Durant

  The northern half of the district includes most of the area of Oklahoma referred to as Green Country while the southern half of the district includes a part of Oklahoma often referred to as Little Dixie

  According to the 2000 US Census the district is 3551 percent urban 2395 percent nonwhite and has a population that is 240 percent Latino and 136 percent foreignborn The district has a higher percentage of Native Americans than any other congressional district in Oklahoma Its representative Markwayne Mullin is one of two Native Americans currently serving in Congress

  The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

  The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

  Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

  Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

  Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
  The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

  The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

  With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

  Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

  Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990

  Manoel Urbano
  Manoel Urbano is a municipality located in the centerwestern region of the Brazilian state of Acre
  As of 2010 it was one of the poorest municipalities in Brazil with a low Human Development Index

  Manoel Urbano is in the state of Acre the Vale do Acre mesoregion and the Sena Madureira microregion
  It is from the state capital Rio Branco along the BR364 which is paved to the municipality
  It is bounded on the north by the state of Amazonas on the south and east by the municipality of Sena Madureira on the west by the municipality of Santa Rosa do Purus on the northwest by the municipality of Feij and on the southwest by Peru
  Its area is

  The municipality contains 2 of the CazumbIracema Extractive Reserve established in 2002 to support sustainable use of the natural resources by the traditional population
  It also contains about 66 of the Chandless State Park created in 2004 which protects an area of rainforest with bamboos that contains various endemic species of flora and fauna

  The history of European settlement dates to the end of the 19th century when two brothers Joo Moaco and Z Moaco founded the Colocao Tabocal settlement on the right bank of the Purus River At that time supplies and produce were shipped via the Purus by boats and smaller vessels from the ports of Belm and Manaus
  One summer a boat named Castelo was stranded during the dry season and was not floated until the next rainy season
  The residents began to call the area Castelo
  In 1936 the residents asked the state government to make the settlement a town named after Manoel Urbano an Amazonian mestizo from the Manacapur region who had explored the Purus River
  In the territorial division of 31 December 1936 the region was the Castelo district of the Sena Madureira municipality
  On 1 March 1963 the municipality of Manoel Urbano was separated from Sena Madureira

  In the 2010 Census its population was 7981 divided between 5278 urban and 2703 rural
  As of 2010 the municipality ranked 5186 out of 5565 of Brazilian municipalities on the Human Development Index
  The overall index was 0551 Income was 0586 longevity was 0767 and education was 0373
  As of 1 July 2014 the estimated population was 8514

Hurricane Michael 2000
Hurricane Michael of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season caused moderate damage in Atlantic Canada The seventeenth tropical cyclone thirteenth named storm and eighth hurricane of the season Michael developed from a nontropical system to the southwest of Bermuda on October15 The system was initially subtropical but rapidly acquired tropical characteristics by October17 Michael quickly strengthened into a hurricane later that day By October20 Michael peaked as a Category2 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson hurricane wind scale at a relatively high latitude of 44N The storm weakened slightly to a Category1 hurricane and became extratropical shortly before making landfall in Newfoundland on October20

As the intensity of Michael was equivalent to a Category1 hurricane during landfall high winds were reported throughout Atlantic Canada especially in Newfoundland Winds from the storm peaked at in St Lawrence Newfoundland other locations across the island reported winds of  High winds caused minor structure damage across Newfoundland confined to vinyl siding peeled off shattered windows and unroofed houses In addition sporadic power outages were also reported from Corner Brook to St Johns Michael also dropped rainfall across Atlantic Canada and in Maine The rainfall was generally light with much of the region reporting between of precipitation Michael also produced high tides accompanied by waves reported as high as by a buoy well offshore of Newfoundland

The system originated out of a nontropical coldcore upper level low that drifted southward into the subtropics The low interacted with a cold front which resulted in the development of a stationary front over the Bahamas on October10 As the cold low drifted southward a surface low developed on October12 The surface low remained mostly stationary until early on October15 as it merged with the upperlevel low and deepened while north of the Bahamas and east of the coast of Florida Later that day the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as a subtropical depression The storm remained stationary over warm water with sea surface temperatures around  while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics Around 0000 UTC on October16 it strengthened into a subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed a stronger storm Later that day the cyclone continued to develop as more thunderstorms formed and persisted near the lowlevel circulation
By 0000 UTC on October17 the transition was completed and Michael was reclassified as a tropical storm as supported by satellite classifications via the Dvorak technique Shortly thereafter the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Seventeen postanalysis later discovered it was actually a tropical storm A welldefined eye quickly developed early on October17 as Michael began to strengthen and continued to organize That afternoon Michael rapidly intensified further and was upgraded to a hurricane as Reconnaissance flights found winds of  At that point Michael began to move northward While Michael was maintaining minimal hurricane status the eye remained ragged yet welldefined Early on October19 Michael briefly strengthened to 140kmh 85mph before weakening slightly six hours later Tracking into cooler water Michael began its extratropical transition while accelerating to the northeast towards Newfoundland which prevented significant weakening The acceleration was caused by a shortwave trough embedded within strong southwesterly midlevel flow

Unexpectedly Michael began to rapidly intensify on October19 while in extratropical transition Later that day a ship report in the eastern eyewall reported a minimum central pressure of and maximum sustained winds of 155kmh 100mph making Michael a Category2 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson hurricane scale The sudden intensification was determined to have been as a result of baroclinic effects as it interacted with an incoming trough which provided additional energy to counter the general weakening of hurricanes while in the high latitudes over seasurface temperatures around  At 2300 UTC on October19 shortly after completing its transition to an extratropical cyclone Michael made landfall near Parsons Harbour Newfoundland with winds of 155kmh 100mph The extratropical system gradually weakened as it tracked across Newfoundland on October20 and slowed down considerably with the presence of the trough The storm was absorbed by another extratropical low just north of Newfoundland that afternoon

Because it was unknown that Michael became extratropical before landfall it was initially considered the first tropical cyclone to strike Newfoundland since Hurricane Luis in 1995 Furthermore Michael was also considered the first hurricane to make landfall in Canada since Hurricane Hortense in 1996 When the Meteorological Service of Canada and the National Research Council flew a Convair research flight into Michael on October19 it was the first successful research flight made into a tropical cyclone by those agencies Subsequent flights have been made into Tropical Storm Karen Hurricane Isabel while inland Hurricane Juan and Hurricane Ophelia

In advance of the storm the Newfoundland Weather Centre posted wind warnings gale warnings storm warnings and hurricane warnings throughout Newfoundland Rainfall advisories were also issued in portions of the East Coast Central Newfoundland the South Coast and the West Coast Offshore storm force wind warnings were declared on October19 for Newfoundland waters Several Special Weather Statements were also posted

Light to moderate damage was reported throughout Newfoundland primarily as a result of the strong winds The entire region was affected by Michael though the majority of the damage was confined to small communities east of where the storm made landfall including Gaultois Harbour Breton Hermitage and English Harbour West These areas reported significant power outages and minor structural damage vinyl siding was peeled off windows were shattered and roof shingles were torn off in some localized locations The most severe damage was in Gaultois where several roofs were torn off and trees were uprooted Wind damage also occurred in the St Johns Metropolitan Area where a Sobeys store in Conception Bay South had broken windows Sporadic power outages were reported throughout the island as far east as St Johns and as far west as Corner Brook As the storm struck at low tide storm surge was insignificant However just prior to landfall waves on the coast of Newfoundland reached heights of  Rainfall near the storms track was generally around  though further inland precipitation reached  Rainfall from the hurricane amounted to at Englee a small fishing community on the Great Northern Peninsula Wind gusts peaked at at St Lawrence with other reports varying between and  Despite severe winds damage was relatively light due to high construction standards in Newfoundland where winter storms routinely result in hurricaneforce winds as well as the sparse population of the area affected

The tug Atlantic Elm lost its tow to the unmanned barge Portland Star on October19 The barge was carrying over 18000 tonnes of cement and diesel fuel and was later reported to have sunk in the Fortune Bay Damage was reported to numerous pleasure craft around the bay due to the waves two sailboats were toppled Also ferry service between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia was disrupted Several offshore buoys and ships reported high winds and low barometric pressure as well as waves of up to 169m 55ft

On October14 and October15 the frontal boundary associated with the hurricanes precursor dropped heavy rainfall on Bermuda amounting to  However as a tropical cyclone Michael remained far from the island Impact outside Newfoundland was generally light However rainfall was greater in some areas of Nova Scotia than in Newfoundland where precipitation reached over North Mountain Light rain was also reported in New Brunswick Prince Edward Island and Quebec Effects from the storm in the United States were minimal limited to light rainfall in the state of Maine which totaled less than
