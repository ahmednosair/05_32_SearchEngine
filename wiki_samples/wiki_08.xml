Founding Father short story
Founding Father is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov It was first published in the October 1965 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction and reprinted in the 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories It was inspired by a cover painting of a spacehelmeted face backed by several crosses provided by the magazines editor Frederik Pohl

An exploratory spacecraft of the Galactic Corps charged with opening up planets for human colonisation sometimes by terraforming crashlands on an alien planet They find that the ecology is heavy in ammonia making the atmosphere unbreathable by humans and the soil unsuitable for the Earthtype plants they have brought for colonisation

As they are unable to take off again the crew spend their time trying to adjust the environment to make it suitable for possible future human colonists by cultivating Earth plants which will create oxygen Although they spend many years at this task they fail and one by one they die of ammonia poisoning 

As the last man dies the flesh of the buried crew feeds the plants and finally helps them to flourish providing the catalyst that alters the environment to become more Earthlike

Hot Water Beach
Hot Water Beach is a beach on Mercury Bay on the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula New Zealand approximately 12 kilometres south east of Whitianga and approximately 175 kilometres from Auckland by car Its name comes from underground hot springs which filter up through the sand between the high and low water tidal reaches The beach is a popular destination both for locals and tourists visiting New Zealand Annual visitor numbers have been estimated at 700000 making it one of the most popular geothermal attractions in the Waikato Region

Within two hours either side of low tide it is possible to dig into the sand allowing hot water to escape to the surface forming a hot water pool The water with a temperature as hot as 64C 147F filters up from two underground fissures located close to each other These natural springs can be found on the beach opposite the offshore rocks Visitors often dig large holes and relax and soak in the thermal water Many visitors bring a spade and bucket with them Spades can also be hired from the nearby surf shop

Care needs to be exercised as the location of the hot springs are not far from the sea even at low tide and visitors may be caught unaware by the large breaking waves Hot Water Beach is known for its dangerous rip currents holes and large waves Signs at the beach advise swimmers not to swim within 50m either side of the offshore rocks opposite the springs and to only swim between the flags if the Hot Water Beach Lifeguard Service are on patrol Hot Water Beachs rip currents have claimed the lives of several unwary visitors and only strong and experienced swimmers are advised to enter the water

Rima Ariadaeus
Rima Ariadaeus is a linear rille on the Moon at  It is named after the crater Ariadaeus which marks its eastern end It is over 300 km long and is categorized as a straight rille because of its linear nature 

Some scientists think that the linear rilles might have formed after large impact events while others believe that the rilles were formed as a surface manifestation of deepseated dike systems when the Moon was still volcanically active Rima Ariadaeus is thought to have been formed when a section of the Moons crust sank down between two parallel fault lines making it a graben or fault trough Rima Ariadaeus shows no trace of associated volcanism and is thus considered to be an end member of the sequence where only pure faulting is involved ie a linear rille

The ridges crossing the rille trough of Rima Ariadaeus and the surrounding plains units have been offset by the trough proving that the ridges are older than the faults Some craters are cut off by the faults and are therefore older Other craters lie on the wall of the trough and are younger than the faulting The faulting must be relatively young because so few craters appear to be younger than the faults and because the edges of the trough appear to be crisp and little affected by slumping and other mass wasting

Apollo mission photographs of the Rima Ariadaeus revealed a 300 kmlong rift line on the surface of the moon On being asked in 2010 about Internet suggestions that this was proof of the Quranic story NASA scientist Brad Bailey said My recommendation is to not believe everything you read on the internet Peerreviewed papers are the only scientifically valid sources of information out there No current scientific evidence reports that the Moon was split into two or more parts and then reassembled at any point in the past

The splitting of the moon was reportedly a miracle attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad It is perhaps alluded to in the Quranic verses 5412

Three of Swords
Three of Swords is the third card of the suit of swords The suit is present in Italian Spanish and tarot decks 

This card depicts a fundamentally sorrowful experience tarot readers suggest this may be in the form of a lost relationship an accidental death or some other form of not just depression or malaise but deeply emotional sorrow When the card appears reversed in a spread this is not usually read as meaning the opposite of sorrow but rather a sorrow that is somehow mitigated by its circumstances or that is not as bad as it could have been It is among the most negative cards within the tarot deck

In the sutta Dhammika along with 500 other lay followers Pali pancahi upasakesatehi approaches the Buddha and his monks Pali bhikkhavo and Dhammika asks the Buddha how should a disciple Pali svako be virtuous Pali sdhu  both a disciple who has gone from home to homeless Pali agr anagrameti and a disciple from a household Pali agrino  panupsakse Dhammika then proceeds to extol the Buddhas compassion and wisdom

In response to Dhammikas question the Buddha first addresses his monks and advises them as follows

The Buddha notes that a householders obligations prevent a householder from fully pursuing a monks path Thus the Buddha articulates the laymans duty Pali gahatthavatta what are essentially the Five Precepts as follows

For the Uposatha the Buddha extols the practice of the Eight Precepts which involve the aforementioned Five Precepts with celibacy alone identified for the third precept and the following three precepts added
The Buddha further stated that when celebrating the Uposatha with a purified heart Pali pasanna citto and rejoicing mind Pali anumodamno the wise Pali viu share their food and drink with monks of the Sangha

In the suttas last verse the Buddha advises that if a lay person supports their parents and engages in fair trading they will be reborn among selfradiant devas

Stephen Atkins Swails
Stephen Atkins Swails 23 February 1832  17 May 1900 was a soldier in the Union Army during the American Civil War Although originally enlisting as a private he was the first AfricanAmerican soldier promoted to commissioned rank as a line officer in that conflict as evidenced by the US War Departments initial refusal of that promotion due to his African descent

Swails was a free black who was so light in coloring that he was often mistaken as white He was single and employed mostly as a waiter in Cooperstown New York at the start of the Civil War and although he fathered several children by Sarah Thompson they never married His enlistment papers state he was employed as a boatman in Elmira New York when he joined the army In 1863 he answered Frederick Douglass call to arms and joined the 54th Massachusetts when it began forming and served in that regiment eventually being commissioned as an officer until the end of the war After the war he settled in South Carolina and later Washington DC becoming a lawyer and politician

Stephen Swails was a member of the 54th Massachusetts enlisting and then rising through the ranks to receive a commission He joined Company F of the 54th on 23 April 1863 and was soon appointed the companys first sergeant Due to the loss of men in the assault on Fort Wagner and when Colonel Edward Hallowell assumed command of the 54th Swails was appointed acting sergeantmajor of the 54th on 12 November 1863

In early 1864 the regiment was posted to Florida as part of General Truman Seymours expedition On 20 February while still performing duty as the regiments sergeantmajor Swails was wounded in the head at the Battle of Olustee Setting out toward the Union supply point at Sanderson he soon fell unconscious on the road but was placed on a cart by one of the 54ths officers On 26 February 1864 Colonel Hallowell
In accordance with the desire of his officers as well as his own recommended to Governor Andrew that Sergeant Swails be commissioned in recognition of many soldiery qualities and his gallantry at Olustee 
On 26 March 1864 the regiment received a list of promotions approved by Governor Andrew one of which was Swails promotion to 2nd lieutenant Thus began the fight to secure for Stephen Swails what may have been the first commission as a line officer given to an African American in the Union Army

In May 1864 while the regiment was posted on Morris Island South Carolina during the siege of Charleston Swails application to muster as a 2nd lieutenant with the regiment was refused by the War Department The reason given was Lieutenant Swails African descent Colonel William Gurney the post commander ordered Swails to remove his officers uniform and reassume duties as an enlisted man However Colonel Hallowell obtained a furlough for Swails and sent him along with all the necessary paperwork to Major General John Foster commander of the Department of the South Once there Lieutenant Swails presented his case and received General Fosters recommendation which was forwarded to higher authority Lieutenant Swails then returned to duty with the regiment In addition to correspondence between the Department of the South Governor Andrew and the War Department Lieutenant Swails also received a furlough to travel to Washington to present his own case He then returned to duty Finally on 17 January 1865 orders were received from the War Department authorizing Stephen Swails to muster as a 2nd lieutenant with the regiment ending almost a yearlong struggle on his behalf by Colonel Hallowell Governor Andrew and the officers of the 54th During this period Swails continued to perform his duties as a line officer in Company D and participated in numerous actions

On 11 April 1865 near Camden South Carolina Lieutenant Swails was wounded for a second time While the 54th was on reconnaissance near a railroad junction several locomotives one with the steam up were observed after dark A detachment led by Lieutenant Swails rushed the trains and captured them As Lieutenant Swails entered the cab of one locomotive he waved his hat in triumph This action drew the attention of the sharpshooters that he had deployed to shoot the trainmen if they tried to escape Mistaking him for a white engineer they fired at and wounded him

Second Lieutenant Swails was promoted to 1st lieutenant on 28 April 1865 and discharged on 20 August 1865 when the regiment mustered out at Boston

After the war Swails worked as an agent for the Freedmens Bureau practiced law in the South and became active in the political life of South Carolina He married Susan Aspinall a mixedrace Charlestonian who bore him three children Irene Stephen Jr and Florine Because Sarah Thompson bore him a son named Stephen Jr he had two children with that name He was the mayor of Kingstree where he lived from 1868 to 1879 He served as a state senator for ten years 18681878 including three terms as president pro tem

Swails was a delegate to the 1868 1872 and 1876 Republican national conventions He became a member of the US Electoral College and also edited a newspaper the Williamsburg Republican

He was forced out of politics after Reconstruction After a white mob tried to assassinate him he resigned from office and through his Republican connections obtained jobs in Washington DC with the US Postal Service and the United States Treasury Department

Stephen Swails is buried in the Friendly Society Cemetery Charleston South Carolina

Because of his complicated private life Stephen Swails descendants are plentiful and live in Toronto upstate New York Philadelphia and Atlanta

One of his surviving grandchilden was James Swails Sr of Rochester New York who died in 2004 His granddaughter Carolyn Janet Rollins and another grandson Robert Swails are also deceased Caroline Janet Rollins was a counselor in New Jersey She married Joseph Tyler Jefferson They have eight surviving children Robert Swails Rollins was a Doctor of Internal Medicine graduated from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania He had two sons and a daughters and lived on Long Island New York Dr Robert Swails Rollins was a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force and after military service had a practice on Long Island New York

In many countries Tarot cards are believed to tell the future or have a divination usage In these countries it is a very negative sign to have this card be turned It is believed that it being turned can be instigated by others as it might be coming up to show that one has been cruel to someone nearby

This card has a lot to do with someones mind and their doubts and pain The card shows a person most often a woman lying down or sitting up but they are or were sleeping When this card is reversed it can be about real or imagined doubts or pain just as dreams can be about real or imagined parts of our life Most often the person on the card is on a bridge symbolizing a person between the worlds of dreaming and reality or also the worlds of life and death

Above the person lies their fears hanging above them in an airy or dreamy way this can be represented through demons devils or even a heavily agitated night sky Often there are sharp objects such as swords or knives representing that a persons fears may pierce or stab through them The swords could also mean that they are there to help the person cut through their own difficulties

If this card is shown in an upright position it can mean deception premonitions and bad dreams suffering and depression cruelty disappointment violence loss and scandal However all of these may be overcome through faith and calculated inaction This is the card of the martyr and with it comes new life out of suffering

This card can represent being plagued by fear guilt doubt and worries that are to a large extent unfounded Chances are the person in question is dealing with a problematic situation or a difficult decision but his or her worst fear is unlikely to materialize

If the card is shown in an illdignified or reversed manner then it has a different meaning When turned this way it means distrust suspicion despair misery or malice Total isolation away from comfort and help institutionalization suicide imprisonment and isolation However in a generally positive spread the reversed meaning of this card can also indicate that the nightmare may be ending The Nine of Swords reversed can actually be a hopeful card counseling faith in the future and the promise of better days ahead

Ten of Swords is a Minor Arcana tarot card Tarot cards are used throughout much of Europe to play tarot card games In Englishspeaking countries where the games are largely unknown tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for divinatory purposes

In the upright or positive light the ten of swords represents destruction being pinned down by a multitude of things or situations The person lying on the ground defeated and bleeding may also represent a feeling of hopelessness and being trapped by emotions or mental anguish since swords represent strife and the mind 

Dark clouds hovering above the person signify despair and a bleak situation However upon closer examination of the images in the RiderWaite card any death or destruction like all things may not be permanent There is hope in spite of the situation the golden sky in the distance suggests that the current situation is bad and things will improve

In the reversed state the card indicates a troubling situation that will continue for a significant amount of time The card suggests that the subject should not despair in difficult times to avoid ruining future prospects for success

According to Waite he is described as riding in full course as if scattering his enemies This fits well as Waite associates it among other things with war and wrath

The Knight of Swords is often taken to represent a confident and articulate young man who may act impetuously The problem is that this Knight though visionary is unrealistic He fights bravely but foolishly In some illustrations he is shown to have forgotten his armor or his helmet A rush to war is a possibility with this warrior When played reversed the Knight of Swords could represent a clever liar secrets or a sly and deceitful confidence trickster A reversed Knight of Swords is also a warning that an intended path would be a terrible mistake or more precisely that reconsidering your actions would be a wise decision

Channa Buddhist
Channa  The Divine Charioteer Pali Channa  6th century BCE in what is now Bihar and Uttar Pradesh India was a royal servant and head charioteer of Prince Siddhartha who was to become the Buddha Channa later became a disciple of the Buddha and achieved arahantship as is described in the 78th verse of the Dhammapada

Channa was a servant in the court of King uddhodana who was entrusted to attend to the needs of Siddhartha who had been lavished and pampered in a series of purposebuilt palaces in order to shield him from thoughts of pain and suffering This was done due to a prophecy by the ascetic Asita who predicted that Siddhartha would renounce the throne to become a spiritual leader were he to contemplate human suffering Channa was the servant who served as the charioteer pulled by the horse Kanthaka when Siddhartha saw the Four sights whilst meeting his subjects in the Sakya capital Kapilavastu which prompted his decision to renounce the world

During these expeditions Channa explained to Siddhartha the sights of an elderly man a sick person a dead person whose funeral was being conducted and finally an ascetic who had renounced worldly life for a spiritual one as Siddhartha who had been secluded from such sights within the palace was taken aback Channa was later entrusted by Siddhartha to accompany him upon his escape from the palace to become an ascetic whilst the remainder of the palace guards were asleep

After initially protesting and refusing to accept that Siddhartha would leave him Channa saddled Kanthaka guiding him out of the town aboard the horse to a forest by the edge of the Anoma River Channa returned Siddharthas acoutrements weapons and hair to Suddhodarnha upon his return to the palace after Siddhartha compelled him to return after Channa had refused to leave him

Upon Siddharthas enlightenment as Gautama Buddha and return to Kapilavastu Channa became a Buddhist monk joining the Sangha Due to his lone accompaniment of the Buddha on his renouncement Channa behaved in an overbearing way to the other monks and frequently criticized the two chief disciples Sariputta and Moggallana In spite of continual advice from The Buddha he continued to abuse the other monks Prior to the parinibbana the Buddha instructed Ananda to impose the brahmadanda on Channa whereby the other monks would simply ignore him After the parinibbana Channa learned of the decree and feeling remorse for his behaviour he fainted three times before asking and obtaining pardon He eventually became an arahant

<doc id="7734583" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7734583" title="Beard Liberation Front">
Beard Liberation Front
The Beard Liberation Front BLF is a British interest group which campaigns in support of beards and opposes pogonophobic discrimination against those who wear them It was founded in 1995 by socialist historian Keith Flett who continues to organise and represent the organisation Apart from its numerous campaigns in support of beards and against pogonophobia in the workplace and discrimination against those who wear beards as part of their religion it currently hosts the annual Beard of the Year award

On the face of it the campaign is semihumorous with its outwardly frivolous aims its occasionally outlandish claims of discrimination and conspiracy and its founder who is also the spokesman for the Campaign for Real Conkers However the organisation has drawn attention to more serious issues having spoken out against among other incidents the suspension of a fireman for refusing to shave off his goatee and the banning of beards among ExxonMobil oil workers in both cases employers claimed that beards interfered with breathing apparatus Flett believes that an issue of real discrimination exists against men with beards Although he admits that a beard unlike race and gender is a matter of choice he has claimed that beardism is associated with more serious forms of discrimination

The size of the organisation is unknown Flett refers to the organisation as an informal network and has claimed a few hundred supporters in the past He is the organisations sole spokesman in the media

On the occasion of its founding Keith Flett claimed that Beards are politically progressive All the great revolutionary socialists had a beard Stalin had a moustache The BLF soon took up the cause of beards in British politics In 1996 the BLF called for a bearded man to be appointed to the Cabinet According to Independent diarist Eagle Eye sources from the Labour Party then in opposition promised that if they were elected the cabinet would include the first bearded minister since Baron Passfield in 1929 Upon Labours victory in the general election a year later the bearded Robin Cook was duly appointed Foreign Secretary Since then however the BLF has regarded New Labour as obsessed with a cleanshaven image with some notable exceptions including David Blunkett and Charles Clarke

In 1998 the BLF expressed outrage at actor Sean Connery being denied a knighthood claiming that normally reliable New Labour sources had told them that the reason was his beard Connery himself claims that his knighthood was delayed because of his support for Scottish independence while others have pointed out his tax exile status and previous remarks that some complained condoned violence against women Connery was eventually knighted in 2000

In 2000 the BLF joined the anticapitalist May Day protests with a mass beard waggle decrying the waste of natural resources involved in producing shaving foam and brushes It also claimed that Robert Burns had a beard and that contemporary pictures of him which depict the Scottish poet as cleanshaven were a manufactured image designed to make him more popular to the English The Burns Federation said that there was no evidence to support Fletts claims and said that he was talking through his beard

In 2002 the BLF called for a semiboycott of the second Harry Potter film Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets citing the continued presence of obviously fake beards worn by actors Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris Flett claimed that the Christmas season was the worst time of year for beardist taunts with the Potter movies adding to the ammunition already given by Father Christmas Acknowledging that the pressure from beardies children would be too great to consider an outright boycott he said that supporters were merely being encouraged to hiss and boo at the screen

In 2006 the BLF joined the ranks of organisations issuing health advice during the recordbreaking heat wave by advising beardwearers to trim their beards cover them with handkerchiefs and to keep them cool by placing them briefly in the freezer department of a fridge or dipping them in a pint of real ale

The BLF boycotted the 2007 World Beard and Moustache Championships as they claimed the event was over obsessive about the cutting and styling of whiskers rather than the pure cultivation of beards They were also angered by the Handlebar Club who were hosting the event because of their full club membership ban of those who possess a beard of any description Handlebar moustache wearer and satirist Michael Atters Attree who was Honorable Chairman and Master of Ceremonies of the 2007 championships and sits upon the committee of the Handlebar Club hit back at the BLF claiming that their attitude towards his Londonbased clubs handling of the WBMC was Nonsense and utter Poppycock He stated Ones personal grooming is of the utmost importance if one is to be a gentleman Often its the beard clubs that have been the WBMC hosts We are just showing the beardies how to do it properly Commenting on the Socialist aspirations of the BLF Attree stated Id rather be shot by a moustachioed fascist than bored to death by the BLF

In 2007 during the Labour leadership campaign the Beard Liberation Front held group discussions and decided to endorse Charles Clarke for the position although he eventually announced he was not standing and would be backing Gordon Brown Organiser Keith Flett was reported as saying

In June 2010 Keith Flett announced that the BLF had set the 2010 Beards and Sandals season to run from 6 June to 31 August

In 2000 Frank Dobson was named Beard 2000 amid controversy over his claim that Labour spin doctors had told him to shave off his prizewinning beard for the upcoming elections for Mayor of London Dobson said that he had told them to Stick it up their wickit

Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn who considered his beard a form of dissent against New Labour defeated Rolf Harris to win 2001s award

2002s winner was Education Secretary Charles Clarke who beat comedian Ricky Gervais and Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams for the title although Flett suggested that his beard was probably a pragmatic one to conceal multiple double chins

The 2004 Beard of the Year was held jointly by cricketer Andrew Flintoff and NATFHE union leader Paul Mackney due to the close polling between them

After the English cricket team regained the Ashes for the first time in sixteen years Andrew Flintoff won the award again in 2005 this time unshared to go with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year award and his MBE The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson came second while former jointwinner Paul Mackney was pushed into third

Englands loss of the Ashes the following year did not prevent the 2006 award going to a cricketer for the third year running this time to England spinbowler Monty Panesar who narrowly won with 30 percent of the vote Cuban President Fidel Castro was second with 29 percent Paul Mackney was again third tying with Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams with 10 percent each

Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds and Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan shared the award for Beard of the cricket World Cup 2007 with Panesar the runnerup

2012 saw the award presented to journalist and radio broadcaster Robin Lustig

Michael Eavis who organises the Glastonbury Festival was awarded Beard of the Noughties beating former Cuban leader Fidel Castro Keith Flett said Both Eavis and Castro have taken a back seat towards the end of the decade but their beards remain iconic Michael Eavis is a true hirsute icon of the Noughties and he beat Castro to the accolade by the merest whisker

In 2013 Gareth Malone won the Beard of the Year He beat John Hurt Geoff Parling and Jeremy Paxman who made it to the shortlist but fell outside the top 3 despite having one of the most discussed beards of 2013

2013 also saw the first St Davids Day Beard of Wales award which went to Adam Jones Leigh Halfpenny won in 2014 and Joe Ledley won in 2016 2015 was won jointly by brewer Toby Copestake and musician Chris Fox The latter also came second in 2016 and won outright in 2017

<doc id="7734670" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7734670" title="Remilitarization of the Rhineland">
Remilitarization of the Rhineland
The remilitarization of the Rhineland  by the German Army began on 7 March 1936 when German military forces entered the Rhineland This was significant because it violated the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaties marking the first time since the end of World War I that German troops had been in this region The remilitarization changed the balance of power in Europe from France and its allies towards Germany making it possible for Germany to pursue a policy of aggression in Western Europe that the demilitarized status of the Rhineland had blocked until then

Under Articles 42 43 and 44 of the 1919 Treaty of Versaillesimposed on Germany by the Allies after the Great WarGermany was forbidden to maintain or construct any fortification either on the Left bank of the Rhine or on the Right bank to the west of a line drawn fifty kilometers to the East of the Rhine If a violation in any manner whatsoever of this Article took place this shall be regarded as committing a hostile actand as calculated to disturb the peace of the world
The Locarno Treaties signed in October 1925 by Germany France Italy and Britain stated that the Rhineland should continue its demilitarized status permanently Locarno was regarded as important as it was a voluntary German acceptance of the Rhinelands demilitarized status as opposed to the diktat dictate of Versailles Under the terms of Locarno Britain and Italy guaranteed the FrancoGerman border and the continued demilitarized status of the Rhineland against a flagrant violation without however defining what constituted a flagrant violation Under the terms of Locarno if Germany should attempt to attack France then Britain and Italy were obliged to go to Frances aid and likewise if France should attack Germany then Britain and Italy would be obliged to Germanys aid The American historian Gerhard Weinberg called the demilitarized status of the Rhineland the single most important guarantee of peace in Europe as it made it impossible for Germany to attack its neighbors in the West and as the demilitarized zone rendered Germany defenseless in the West impossible to attack its neighbors in the East as it left Germany open to a devastating French offensive if the Reich tried to invade any of the states guaranteed by the French alliance system in Eastern Europe the socalled Cordon sanitaire

The Versailles Treaty also stipulated that Allied military forces would withdraw from the Rhineland by 1935 However the German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann announced in 1929 that Germany would not ratify the 1928 Young Plan for continuing to pay reparations unless the Allies agreed to leave the Rhineland in 1930 The British delegation at the Hague Conference on German reparations in 1929 proposed that reparations paid by Germany be reduced and that British and French forces should evacuate the Rhineland The last British soldiers left in late 1929 and the last French soldiers left in June 1930 As long as the French continued to occupy the Rhineland the Rhineland functioned as a form of collateral under which the French could respond to any German attempt at overt rearmament by annexing the Rhineland Once the last French soldiers left the Rhineland in June 1930 it could no longer play its collateral role thus opening the door for German rearmament The French decision to build the Maginot Line in 1929 was a tacit French admission that it was only a matter of time before German rearmament on a massive scale would begin sometime in the 1930s and that the Rhineland was going to be remilitarized sooner or later Intelligence from the Deuxime Bureau indicated that Germany had been violating Versailles continuously all through the 1920s with the considerable help of the Soviet Union and with the French troops out of the Rhineland it could only be expected that Germany would become more open about violating Versailles The Maginot Line in its turn lessened the importance of the Rhinelands demilitarized status from a French security viewpoint

The foreign policy of Fascist Italy was to maintain an equidistant stance from all the major powers in order to exercise determinant weight which by whatever power Italy chose to align with would decisively change the balance of power in Europe and the price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe andor Africa 

The foreign policy goal of the Soviet Union was set forth by Joseph Stalin in a speech on 19 January 1925 that if another world war broke out between the capitalist states that We will enter the fray at the end throwing our critical weight onto the scale a weight that should prove to be decisive To promote this goal which would lead to the global triumph of Communism the Soviet Union tended to support German efforts to challenge the Versailles system by assisting German secret rearmament a policy that caused much tension with France An additional problem in FrancoSoviet relations was the Russian debt issue Before 1917 the French had been by far the largest investors in Imperial Russia and the largest buyers of Russian debt so the decision by Lenin in 1918 to repudiate all debts and to confiscate all private property whether it be owned by Russians or by foreigners had hurt the world of French business and finance quite badly The question of the Russian debt repudiation and compensation for French businesses affected by Soviet nationalisation policies poisoned FrancoSoviet relations until the early 1930s 

The centerpiece of interwar French diplomacy had been the cordon sanitaire in Eastern Europe which was intended to keep both the Soviet Union and Germany out of Eastern Europe To this end France had signed treaties of alliance with Poland in 1921 Czechoslovakia in 1924 Romania in 1926 and Yugoslavia in 1927 The cordon sanitaire states were intended as a collective replacement for Imperial Russia as Frances chief eastern ally The states of the cordon sanitaire emerged as an area of French political military economic and cultural influence 

As regards Germany it had always been assumed by the states of the cordon sanitaire that if Germany should attack any of them France would respond by beginning an offensive into western Germany Long before 1933 German military and diplomatic elites had regarded the Rhinelands demilitarized status as only temporary and planned to remilitarize the Rhineland at the first favorable diplomatic opportunity In December 1918 at a meeting of Germanys leading generals the German Army functioned as a state within the state it had decided that the chief aim would be to rebuild German military power to launch a new world war to win the world power status that the Reich had sought but failed to win in the last war All through the 1920s and the early 1930s the Reichswehr had been developing plans for a war to destroy France and its ally Poland which necessarily presumed remilitarization of the Rhineland Steps were taken by the German government to prepare for the remilitarization such as keeping former barracks in a good state of repair hiding military materials in secret depots and building customs and fire watch towers that could be easily converted into observation and machine gun posts along the frontier

From 1919 to 1932 British defense spending was based upon the Ten Year Rule which assumed that there was to be no major war for the next ten years a policy that led to the British military being cut to the bone Amongst British decisionmakers the idea of the continental commitment of sending a large army to fight on the European mainland against Germany was never explicitly rejected but was not favored The memory of the heavy losses taken in the Great War had led many to see the continental commitment of 1914 as a serious mistake For most of the interwar period the British were extremely reluctant to make security commitments in Eastern Europe regarding the region as too unstable and likely to embroil Britain in unwanted wars At most Britain was willing to make only limited security commitments in Western Europe and even then tried to avoid the continental commitment as much as possible In 1925 the British Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain had famously stated in public at the Locarno conference that the Polish Corridor was not worth the bones of a single British grenadier As such Chamberlain declared that Britain would not guarantee the GermanPolish border on the grounds that the Polish Corridor should be returned to Germany That the British did not take even their Locarno commitments seriously could be seen in Whitehalls prohibition of the British military chiefs holding staff talks with German French and Italian militaries about what to do if a flagrant violation of Locarno occurred In general for most of the 1920s30s British foreign policy was based upon appeasement under which the international system established by Versailles would be revised in Germanys favor within limits in order to win German acceptance of that international order and thereby ensure the peace One of the main British aims at Locarno was to create a situation where Germany could pursue territorial revisionism in Eastern Europe peacefully The British viewpoint was that if FrancoGerman relations improved France would gradually abandon the cordon sanitaire 

Once France had abandoned its allies in Eastern Europe as the price of better relations with the Reich the Poles and Czechoslovaks would be forced to adjust to German demands and would peacefully hand over the territories claimed by Germany such as the Sudetenland the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig modern Gdask Poland British policymakers tended to exaggerate French power with the normally Francophile Sir Robert Van Vansittart the Permanent UnderSecretary at the Foreign Office writing in 1931 that Britain was faced with an unbearable French domination of Europe and what was needed was a revival of German power to counterbalance French power French economic and demographic weaknesses in the face of Germanys strengths such as the Reichs far larger population and economy together with the fact that much of France had been devastated by World War I while Germany had escaped mostly undamaged were little appreciated in Whitehall

In March 1933 the German Defence Minister General Werner von Blomberg had plans drawn up for remilitarization Blomberg starting in the fall of 1933 had a number of the paramilitary Landspolizei units in the Rhineland given secret military training and equipped with military weapons in order to prepare for remilitarization General Ludwig Becks memo of March 1935 on the need for Germany to secure Lebensraum living space in Eastern Europe had accepted that remilitarization should take place as soon it was diplomatically possible In general it was believed by German military diplomatic and political elites that it would not be possible to remiltarize before 1937

The change of regime in Germany in 1933 did cause alarm in London but there was considerable uncertainty about what Hitlers long term intentions were This uncertainty over what Hitlers ultimate intentions in foreign policy were was to color much of British policy towards Germany until 1939 British decisionmakers could never quite decide if Hitler was merely seeking the acceptable goal to the British of revising Versailles or the unacceptable goal of seeking to dominate Europe British policy towards Germany was a dualtrack policy of seeking a general settlement with the Reich in which the legitimate German complaints about the Versailles treaty would be addressed in Germanys favor while at the same time pursuing rearmament to negotiate with Germany from a position of strength to deter Hitler from choosing war as an option and in a worstcase scenario ensure that Britain was prepared if Hitler really did want to conquer Europe In February 1934 a secret report by the Defence Requirements Committee identified Germany as the ultimate potential enemy which British rearmament was to be directed against Although the possibility of German bombing attacks against British cities increased the importance of having a friendly power on the other side of the English Channel many British decisionmakers were cool if not downright hostile towards the idea of the continental commitment When British rearmament began in 1934 the Army received the lowest priority in terms of funding after the air force and the navy in part to rule out the continental commitment as an option Increasingly decisionmakers came to favor the idea of limited liability under which if the continental commitment were to be made Britain should only send the smallest possible expeditionary force to Europe and reserve its main efforts towards the war in the air and on the sea Britains refusal to make the continental commitment on the same scale as World War I caused tensions with the French who believed that it would be impossible to defeat Germany without another largescale continental commitment and deeply disliked the idea that they should do the bulk of the fighting on the land

Starting in 1934 the French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou decided to put an end to any potential German aggression by building a network of alliances intended to encircle Germany and made overtures to the Soviet Union and Italy Until 1933 the Soviet Union had supported German efforts to challenge the Versailles system but the strident anticommunism of the National Socialist regime together with its claim for Lebensraum led the Soviets change positions on the question of maintaining the Versailles system In September 1933 the Soviet Union ended its secret support for German rearmament which had started in 1921 Under the guise of collective security the Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov started to praise the Versailles system which until then the Soviet leaders had denounced as a capitalist plot to enslave Germany 

Starting in the 1920s Benito Mussolini had subsidized the rightwing Heimwehr Home Defense movement in Austria and after the ultraconservative Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss had seized dictatorial power in March 1933 Austria had fallen within the Italian sphere of influence The terrorist campaign mounted by Austrian Nazis with the open support of Germany against the Dollfuss regime with the aim of overthrowing Dollfuss to achieve an Anschluss caused considerable tensions between Rome and Berlin Mussolini had warned Hitler several times that Austria was within the Italian sphere of influence not the German and to cease trying to overthrow his protg Dollfuss On 25 July 1934 there had occurred the July Putsch in Vienna that saw Dollfuss assassinated by the Austrian SS and an announcement by the Austrian Nazis that the Anschluss was at hand At the same time that Austrian Nazis attempted to seize power all over Austria the SS Austrian Legion based in Bavaria began to attack frontier posts along the GermanAustrian border in what looked like the beginning of an invasion In response Mussolini had mobilized the Italian Army concentrated several divisions at the Brenner Pass and warned Hitler that Italy would go to war with Germany if he tried to follow up the putsch by invading Austria The Austrianborn Hitler although deeply offended by Mussolinis blunt assertions that his birthplace was within the sphere of influence of any power other than Germany nevertheless realized he was in no position to do anything except to beat a humiliating retreat To his disgust the German Fuhrer had to disallow the Putsch he had ordered and not follow it up by invading Austria while the Austrian government crushed the Putsch by the Austrian Nazis 

After Barthou was assassinated on 9 October 1934 his work in trying to build antiGerman alliances with the Soviet Union and Italy was continued by Pierre Laval On 7 January 1935 during a summit in Rome Laval essentially told Mussolini that he had a free hand in the Horn of Africa and France would not oppose an Italian invasion of Ethiopia On 14 April 1935 Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald of Great Britain Premier Pierre Laval of France and Prime Minister Benito Mussolini met in Stresa to form the Stresa Front to oppose any further German violations of Versailles following the German statement in March 1935 that Germany would no longer abide by Parts V or VI of the Treaty of Versailles In the spring of 1935 joint staff talks had begun between France and Italy with the aim of forming an antiGerman military alliance On 2 May 1935 Laval travelled to Moscow where he a signed a treaty of alliance with Soviet Union At once the German government began a violent press campaign against the FrancoSoviet pact claiming it was a violation of Locarno that was an immense danger for the Reich

In his peace speech of May 21 1935 Adolf Hitler stated In particular they the Germans will uphold and fulfill all obligations arising out of the Locarno Treaty so long as the other parties are on their side ready to stand by that pact That line in Hitlers speech was written by his foreign minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath who wished to reassure foreign leaders who felt threatened by Germanys denunciation in March 1935 of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles which had disarmed Germany At the same time Neurath wanted to provide an opening for the eventual remilitarization of the Rhineland hence the conditional hedging of the promise to obey Locarno only as long as other powers did Hitler always took the line that Germany did not consider itself bound by the Diktat of Versailles but that Germany would respect any treaty that it willingly signed such as Locarno under which Germany had promised to keep the Rhineland demilitarized forever hence Hitler always promised during his peace speeches to obey Locarno as opposed to Versailles

On 7 June 1935 MacDonald resigned as British Prime Minister due to ailing health and was replaced by Stanley Baldwin of the Conservative Party the leadership change did not affect British foreign policy in any meaningful way On October 3 1935 Italy invaded Ethiopia and thus began the Abyssinia Crisis Under strong pressure from a British public opinion which was very much in favor of collective security the British government took the lead in pressing the League of Nations for sanctions against Italy The decision of the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to take a strong line in favor of collective security was mostly motivated by domestic politics Having just won an election on 14 November 1935 on the platform of upholding collective security the Baldwin government pressed very strongly for sanctions against Italy for invading Ethiopia The League Assembly voted for a British motion to impose sanctions on Italy with immediate effect on 18 November 1935

The British line that collective security must be upheld with regard to Ethiopia caused considerable tensions between Paris and London with the French taking the viewpoint that Hitler not Mussolini was the real danger to the peace and that if the price of continuing Stresa Front was accepting the conquest of Ethiopia it was worth paying The British historian Correlli Barnett wrote for Laval all that really mattered was Nazi Germany His eyes were on the demilitarised zone of the Rhineland his thoughts on the Locarno guarantees To estrange Italy one of the Locarno powers over such a question as Abyssinia did not appeal to Lavals Auvergnat peasant mind With Paris and London openly at loggerheads over the correct response to Italian invasion of Ethiopia to say nothing of the very public rift between Rome and London an opening was seen in Germany for remilitarization of the Rhineland The AngloItalian dispute placed the French in an uncomfortable position On one hand Britains repeated refusal to make the continental commitment increased the value to the French of Italy as the only other nation in Western Europe capable of fielding a large army against Germany But on the other hand the British economy was far larger than the Italian economy which thus meant from the longterm French perspective Britain was a much better ally as Britain had vastly more economic staying power than Italy for what was assumed would be another guerre de la longue dure war of the long duration ie a long war against Germany The American historian Zach Shore wrote that French leaders found themselves in the awkward position of seeking the military cooperation of two incompatible allies Since Italy and Britain had clashing interests in the Mediterranean France could not ally with one without alienating the other To avoid a total rupture with Britain France did not use its veto power as a member of the League Council and instead voted for the sanctions But Laval did use the threat of a French veto to water down the sanctions and to have such items such as oil and coal which might have crippled Italy removed from the sanctions list Nonetheless Mussolini felt betrayed by his French friends and next to Britain France was the nation that he was most angry with for the sanctions Despite all of Mussolinis outrage about the sanctions they were largely ineffective The United States and Germanyboth of which were not members of the Leaguechose not to abide by the sanctions and as result American and German businesses supplied Italy with all of the goods that League had placed on the sanctions list making the sanctions more of an annoyance than a problem for the Italians

Italian cryptographers had broken the British naval and diplomatic codes in the early 1930s consequently Mussolini knew very well that although Britain might threaten war through such moves like reinforcing the Mediterranean Fleet in September 1935 the British had already decided in advance that they would never go to war for Ethiopia Armed with this knowledge Mussolini felt free to engage in all sorts of wild threats of war against Britain from late 1935 onwards declaring at one point that he rather see the entire world go up in a blaze than stop his invasion of Ethiopia Mussolinis frequent threats to destroy the British Empire if the British continued to oppose his Ethiopian war had created the impression in late 1935early 1936 that Britain and Italy were on the verge of war

In late 1935 Neurath started rumours that Germany was considering remilitarizing the Rhineland in response to the FrancoSoviet pact of May 1935 which Neurath insisted was a violation of Locarno that menaced Germany At the same time Neurath ordered German diplomats to start drawing up legal briefs justifying remilitarization of the Rhineland under the grounds that the FrancoSoviet pact violated Locarno In doing so Neurath was acting without orders from Hitler but in the expectation that time was ripe for remilitarization due to the crisis in AngloItalian relations caused by the ItaloEthiopian War To resolve the Abyssinia Crisis Robert Vansittart the Permanent Undersecretary at the British Foreign Office proposed to the Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare what came to be known as the HoareLaval plan under which half of Ethiopia would be given to Italy with the rest nominally independent under the Emperor Haile Selassie Vansittart who was a passionate Francophile and an equally ardent Germanophobe saw Germany as the real danger and wanted to sacrifice Ethiopia for the sake of maintaining the Stresa Front Vansittart had a powerful ally in Hankey a proponent of realpolitik who saw the entire idea of imposing sanctions on Italy as so much folly Persuaded of the merits of Vansittarts approach Hoare travelled to Paris to meet with Laval who agreed to the plan However Alexis St Leger the General Secretary at the Quai dOrsaywho unusually amongst the generally proItalian French officials happened to have a visceral dislike of Fascist Italyand he decided to sabotage the HoareLaval plan by leaking it to the French press St Leger was by all accounts a rather strange character who sometimes chose to undercut policy initiatives that he disapproved of In a strange asymmetry the Francophile Vansittart at the Foreign Office was in favor the French approach that it was worth letting Italy conquer Ethiopia in order to continue the Stresa Front whereas the Anglophile St Leger at the Quai dOrsay was in favor of the British approach of upholding collective security even at the risk of damaging the Stresa Front When the news of the HoareLaval plan to essentially reward Mussolini reached Britain it caused such an uproar that Hoare had to resign in disgrace to be replaced by Anthony Eden and the newly elected Baldwin government was almost toppled by a backbenchers revolt Baldwin lied to the House of Commons by claiming quite falsely that the cabinet was unaware of the HoareLaval plan and that Hoare was a rogue minister acting on his own In France public opinion was just as outraged by the HoareLaval plan as British public opinion was Lavals policy of internal devaluation of forcing deflation on the French economy in order to increase French exports to combat the Great Depression had already made him extremely unpopular and the HoareLaval plan further damaged his reputation The Chamber of Deputies debated the plan on 27 and 28 December the Popular Front condemned it with Lon Blum telling Laval You have tried to give and to keep You wanted to have your cake and eat it You cancelled your words by your deeds and your deeds by your words You have debased everything by fixing intrigue and slickness  Not sensitive enough to the importance of great moral issues you have reduced everything to the level of your petty methods 

Mussolini for his part rejected the HoareLaval plan saying he wanted to subject all of Ethiopia not just half Following the fiasco of the HoareLaval plan the British government resumed its previous policy of imposing sanctions against Italy in a halfhearted way which in turn imposed serious strains on relations with both Paris and especially Rome Given the provocative Italian attitude Britain wanted to begin staff talks with France for a possible war with Italy On 13 December 1935 Neurath told the British ambassador Sir Eric Phipps that Berlin regarded any AngloFrench staff talks without Germany  even if directed only against Italy  as a violation of Locarno that would force Germany to remilitarize the Rhineland Through ItaloGerman relations were quite unfriendly in 1935 Germany had been an outspoken supporter of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia and offered Mussolini a benevolent neutrality Under the banner of white supremacy and fascism Hitler came out strongly for the Italian invasion and he made a point of shipping the Italians various raw materials and weapons which the League of Nations sanctions had forbidden Italy Hitlers support for the Italian aggression won him much goodwill in Rome By contrast Lavals proItalian intrigues and his efforts to sabotage the Britishled effort to impose sanctions on Italy created a lasting climate of distrust between the British and the French

The British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden anticipated that by 1940 Germany might be persuaded to return to the League of Nations accept arms limitations and renounce her territorial claims in Europe in exchange for remilitarization of the Rhineland return of the former German African colonies and German economic priority along the Danube The Foreign Offices Ralph Wigram advised that Germany should be permitted to remilitarise the Rhineland in exchange for an air pact outlawing bombing and a German promise not to use force to change their borders However Wigram did not succeed in convincing his colleagues or cabinet ministers Edens goal has been defined as that of a general settlement which sought a return to the normality of the twenties and the creation of conditions in which Hitler could behave like Stresemann Gustav Stresemann German chancellor foreign minister and democrat during the Weimar Republic On 16 January 1936 the French Premier Pierre Laval submitted the FrancoSoviet Pact to the Chamber of Deputies for ratification In January 1936 during his visit to London to attend the funeral of King George V Neurath told Eden If however the other signatories or guarantors of the Locarno Pact should conclude bilateral agreements contrary to the spirit of Locarno Pact we should be compelled to reconsider our attitude Edens response to Neuraths veiled threat that Germany would remilitarize the Rhineland if the French National Assembly ratified the FrancoSoviet pact convinced Neurath that if Germany remilitarized then Britain would take Germanys side against France There was a clause in the Locarno treaty calling for binding international arbitration if the one of the signatory powers signed a treaty that the other powers considered to be incompatible with Locarno Both Neurath and his State Secretary Prince Bernhard von Blow professed to every foreign diplomat with whom they spoke that the FrancoSoviet Pact was a violation of Locarno but at the same time both strongly advised Hitler not to seek international arbitration in order to determine whether the FrancoSoviet pact really was a violation of Locarno Seeking international arbitration was a loselose situation for Germany on the one hand if it were ruled that the FrancoSoviet pact was incompatible with Locarno then the French would have to abandon the pact thereby depriving Germany of an excuse to remilitarize on the other hand if it were ruled that FrancoSoviet pact was compatible with Locarno Germany would likewise have no excuse for remilitarization Although Neurath indicated several times in press conferences in early 1936 that Germany was planning on using the arbitration clause in Locarno in order to help convince public opinion abroad that the FrancoSoviet pact was a violation of Locarno the German government never invoked the arbitration clause

At the same time Neurath received an intelligence report on 10 January 1936 from Gottfried Aschmann the Chief of the Auswrtiges Amts Press Division who during a visit to Paris in early January 1936 had talked to a minor French politician named Jean Montiny who was a close friend of Premier Laval who had frankly mentioned that Frances economic problems had retarded French military modernization and that France would do nothing if Germany remilitarized the Rhineland  Neurath did not pass on Aschmanns report to Hitler but he placed a high value upon it Neurath was seeking to improve his position within the Nazi regime by repeatedly assuring Hitler during the Rhineland crisis that the French would do nothing without telling Hitler the source of his selfassurance Neurath came across as a diplomat blessed with an uncanny intuition something that improved his standing with Hitler Traditionally in Germany the conduct of foreign policy had been the work of the Auswrtiges Amt Foreign Office but starting in 1933 Neurath had been faced with the threat of Nazi interlopers in diplomacy as various NSDAP agencies started to conduct their own foreign policies independent of and often against the Auswrtiges Amt The most serious of the interlopers in diplomacy was the Dienststelle Ribbentrop a sort of alternative foreign ministry loosely linked to the NSDAP headed by Joachim von Ribbentrop which aggressively sought to undercut the work of the Auswrtiges Amt at every turn Further exacerbating the rivalry between the Dienststelle Ribbentrop and the Auswrtiges Amt was the fact that Neurath and Ribbentrop utterly hated one another with Ribbentrop making no secret of his belief that he would be a much better foreign minister than Neurath whereas Neurath viewed Ribbentrop as a hopelessly inept amateur diplomat meddling in matters that did not concern him 

During January 1936 the German Chancellor and Fhrer Adolf Hitler decided to reoccupy the Rhineland Originally Hitler had planned to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1937 but chose in early 1936 to move remilitarization forward by a year for several reasons namely the ratification by the French National Assembly of the FrancoSoviet pact of 1935 allowed him to present his coup both at home and abroad as a defensive move against FrancoSoviet encirclement the expectation that France would be better armed in 1937 the government in Paris had just fallen and a caretaker government was in charge economic problems at home required a foreign policy success to restore the regimes popularity the ItaloEthiopian War which had set Britain against Italy had effectively broken up the Stresa Front and apparently because Hitler simply did not feel like waiting an extra year In his biography of Hitler the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw argued that the primary reasons for the decision to remilitarize in 1936 as opposed to 1937 were Hitlers preference for dramatic unilateral coups to obtain what could easily be achieved via quiet talks and Hitlers need for a foreign policy triumph to distract public attention from the major economic crisis that was gripping Germany in 193536

During a meeting between Prince Bernhard von Blow the State Secretary at the Auswrtiges Amt who is not to be confused with his more famous uncle Chancellor Bernhard von Blow and the French Ambassador Andr FranoisPoncet on 13 January 1936 where Blow handed FranoisPoncet yet another note protesting against the FrancoSoviet pact FranoisPoncet accused Blow to his face of seeking any excuse no matter how bizarre strange or implausible to send troops back into the Rhineland On 15 January 1936 a topsecret NKVD report was sent to Joseph Stalin entitled Summary of Military and Political Intelligence on Germany which reported  based on statements from various diplomats in the Auswrtiges Amt  that Germany was planning on remilitarizing the Rhineland in the nearfuture The same summary quoted Blow as saying that if Britain and France made any sort of agreement concerning military cooperation that did not involve Germany We would view this as a violation of Locarno and if we are not dragged into participating in negotiations we will not consider ourselves bound by Locarno obligations concerning the preservation of the Rhine demilitarized zone The Soviet report warning of German plans for remilitarization was not passed on to either the British or French governments

On 17 January 1936 Benito Mussolini  who was angry about the League of Nations sanctions applied against his country for aggression against Ethiopia  told the German Ambassador in Rome Ulrich von Hassell that he wanted to see an AustroGerman agreement which would in practice bring Austria into Germanys wake so that she could pursue no other foreign policy than one parallel with Germany If Austria as a formally independent state were thus in practice to become a German satellite he would have no objection 

By recognizing that Austria was within the German sphere of influence Mussolini had removed the principal problem in ItaloGerman relations ItaloGerman relations had been quite bad since mid1933 and especially since the July Putsch of 1934 so Mussolinis remarks to Hassell in early 1936 indicating that he wanted a rapprochement with Germany were considered extremely significant in Berlin In another meeting Mussolini told Hassell that he regarded the Stresa Front of 1935 as dead and that Italy would do nothing to uphold Locarno should Germany violate it Initially German officials did not believe in Mussolinis desire for a rapprochement but after Hitler sent Hans Frank on a secret visit to Rome carrying a message from the Fhrer about Germanys support for Italys actions in the conquest of Ethiopia ItaloGerman relations improved markedly On 24 January the very unpopular Laval resigned as premier rather than be defeated on a motion of noconfidence in the National Assembly as the Radical Socialists decided to join the leftwing Popular Front thereby ensuring an antiLaval majority in the Chamber of Deputies A caretaker government was formed in Paris led by Albert Sarraut until new elections could be held The Sarraut cabinet was a mixture of men of the right like Georges Mandel the center like Georges Bonnet and the left like Joseph PaulBoncour which made it almost impossible for the cabinet to make decisions Immediately the Sarraut government came into conflict with Britain as Eden started to press the League for oil sanctions against Italy something that the French were completely opposed to and threatened to veto

On 11 February 1936 the new French Premier Albert Sarraut affirmed that his government would work for the ratification of the FrancoSoviet pact On February 12 1936 Hitler met with Neurath and his AmbassadoratLarge Joachim von Ribbentrop to ask their opinion of the likely foreign reaction to remilitarization Neurath supported remiltarization but argued that Germany should negotiate more before doing so whereas Ribbentrop argued for unilateral remilitarization at once Ribbentrop told Hitler that if France went to war in response to German remiltarization then Britain would go to war with France an assessment of the situation with which Neurath did not agree but one that encouraged Hitler to proceed with remiltarization

On the 12th of February Hitler informed his War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg of his intentions and asked the head of the Army General Werner von Fritsch how long it would take to transport a few infantry battalions and an artillery battery into the Rhineland Fritsch answered that it would take three days organization but he was in favour of negotiation as he believed that the German Army was in no state for armed combat with the French Army The Chief of the General Staff General Ludwig Beck warned Hitler that the German Army would be unable to successfully defend Germany against a possible retaliatory French attack Hitler reassured Fritsch that he would withdraw his forces if there were a French countermove Weinberg wrote thatGerman military plans provided for small German units to move into the Rhineland joining the local militarized police Landespolizei and staging a fighting withdrawal if there were a military counteraction from the West The story that the Germans had orders to withdraw if France moved against them is partially correct but essentially misleading the withdrawal was to be a tactical defensive move not a return to the earlier position The possibility of a war was thus accepted by Hitler but he clearly did not think the contingency very likely The operation was codenamed Winter Exercise 

Unknown to Hitler on 14 February Eden had written to the Quai dOrsay stating that Britain and France should enter betimes into negotiationsfor the surrender on conditions of our rights in the zone while such surrender still has got a bargaining value Eden wrote to the British cabinet that the end of the demilitarized zone would not merely change local military values but is likely to lead to farreaching political repercussions of a kind which will further weaken Frances influence in Central and Eastern Europe In February 1936 the Deuxime Bureau started to submit reports suggesting that Germany was planning on sending troops into the Rhineland in the very nearfuture Because FranoisPoncets reports from Berlin indicated that the German economic situation was quite precarious it was felt in Paris that sanctions against Germany could be quite devastating and might even lead to the collapse of the Nazi regime

Along with Ribbentrop and Neurath Hitler discussed the planned remilitarization in detail with War Minister General Werner von Blomberg Chief of General Staff General Ludwig Beck Hermann Gring Army CommanderinChief General Werner von Fritsch and Ulrich von Hassell Ribbentrop and Blomberg were in favor Beck and Fritsch were opposed and Neurath and Hassell were supportive but argued that there was no real need to act now as quiet diplomacy would soon ensure remilitarization That Hitler was in close and regular contact with Hassell the ambassador to Italy all through February and early March showed how much importance Hitler attached to Italy Of the three leaders of the Stresa front Mussolini was easily the one Hitler most respected and so Hitler viewed Italy as the key taking the view that if Mussolini decided to oppose the remilitarization then Britain and France would follow Not withstanding Mussolinis remarks in January Hitler was still not convinced of Italian support and ordered Hassell to find out Mussolinis attitude On 22 February Hassell wrote in his diary that the pending ratification of the FrancoSoviet pact was just a pretext writing it was quite clear that he Hitler really wanted the ratification to use as a platform for his action That same day Hassell held a meeting with Mussolini where Il Duce stated if oil sanctions were applied against Italy he would make Locarno disappear of its own accord and that anyhow Italy would not act if German troops were to enter the Rhineland 

At the same time Neurath started preparing elaborate documents justifying remilitarization as a response forced on Germany by the FrancoSoviet pact and advised Hitler to keep the number of troops sent into the Rhineland very small so to allow the Germans to claim that they had not committed a flagrant violation of Locarno both Britain and Italy were only committed to offering a military response to a flagrant violation In the statement justifying remilitarization that Neurath prepared for the foreign press the German move was portrayed as something forced on a reluctant Germany by ratification of the FrancoSoviet pact and strongly hinted that Germany would return to the League of Nations if remilitarization was accepted After meeting with Hitler on 18 February Baron von Neurath expressed the viewpoint for Hitler in the first instance domestic motives were decisive

At the same time that Frank was visiting Rome Gring had been dispatched to Warsaw to meet the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Jzef Beck and to ask the Poles to remain neutral if France decided on war in response to the remilitarization of the Rhineland Colonel Beck believed that the French would do nothing if Germany remilitarized the Rhineland and thus could assure those in the Polish government who wished for Poland to stay close to its traditional ally France that Poland would act if France did while at the same time telling Gring that he wanted closer GermanPolish relations and would do nothing in the event of remilitarization

On 13 February 1936 during a meeting with Prince Bismarck of the German Embassy in London Ralph Wigram the head of the Central Department of the British Foreign Office stated that the British government whose Prime Minister from 1935 to 1937 was Stanley Baldwin wanted a working agreement on an air pact that would outlaw bombing and that Britain would consider revising Versailles and Locarno in Germanys favor for an air pact Prince Bismarck reported to Berlin that Wigram had hinted quite strongly that the things that Britain were willing to consider revising included remilitarization On 22 February 1936 Mussolini who was still angry about the League of Nations sanctions applied against his country for aggression against Ethiopia told von Hassell that Italy would not honour Locarno if Germany were to remilitarize the Rhineland Even if Mussolini had wanted to honour Locarno practical problems would have arisen as the bulk of the Italian Army was at that time engaged in the conquest of Ethiopia and as there is no common ItaloGerman frontier

Historians debate the relation between Hitlers decision to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1936 and his broad longterm goals Those historians who favour an intentionist interpretation of German foreign policy such as Klaus Hildebrand and the late Andreas Hillgruber see the Rhineland remilitarization as only one stage of Hitlers stufenplan stage by stage plan for world conquest Those historians who take a functionist interpretation see the Rhineland remilitarization more as ad hoc improvised response on the part of Hitler to the economic crisis of 1936 as a cheap and easy way of restoring the regimes popularity The British Marxist historian Timothy Mason famously argued that Hitlers foreign policy was driven by domestic needs related to a failing economy and that it was economic problems at home as opposed to Hitlers will or intentions that drove Nazi foreign policy from 1936 onwards which ultimately degenerated into a barbaric variant of social imperialism which led to a flight into war in 1939 

As Hildebrand himself has noted these interpretations are not necessarily mutually exclusive Hildebrand has argued that although Hitler did have a programme for world domination the way in which Hitler attempted to execute his programme was highly improvised and much subject to structural factors both on the international stage and domestically that were often not under Hitlers control On February 26 the French National Assembly ratified the FrancoSoviet pact On February 27 Hitler had lunch with Hermann Gring and Joseph Goebbels to discuss the planned remilitarization with Goebbels writing in his diary afterwards Still somewhat too early On February 29 an interview Hitler had on February 21 with the French fascist and journalist Bertrand de Jouvenel was published in the newspaper ParisMidi During his interview with a clearly admiring de Jouvenel Hitler professed himself a man of peace who desperately wanted friendship with France and blamed all of the problems in FrancoGerman relations on the French who for some strange reason were trying to encircle Germany via the FrancoSoviet pact despite the evident fact that the Fuhrer was not seeking to threaten France Hitlers interview with de Jouvenel was intended to influence French public opinion into believing that it was their government that was responsible for the remilitarization Only on March 1 did Hitler finally make up his mind to proceed A further factor in Hitlers decision was that the sanctions committee of the League was due to start discussing possible oil sanctions against Italy on 2 March something that was likely to lead the diplomats of Europe to be focused on the Abyssinia Crisis at the expense of everything else

Not long after dawn on March 7 1936 nineteen German infantry battalions and a handful of planes entered the Rhineland By doing so Germany violated Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty of Locarno They reached the river Rhine by 1100am and then three battalions crossed to the west bank of the Rhine At the same time Baron von Neurath summoned the Italian ambassador Baron Bernardo Attolico the British ambassador Sir Eric Phipps and the French ambassador Andr FranoisPoncet to the Wilhelmstrasse to hand them notes accusing France of violating Locarno by ratifying the FrancoSoviet pact and announcing that as such Germany had decided to renounce Locarno and remilitarize the Rhineland

When German reconnaissance learned that thousands of French soldiers were congregating on the FrancoGerman border General Blomberg begged Hitler to evacuate the German forces Under Blombergs influence Hitler nearly ordered the German troops to withdraw but was then persuaded by the resolutely calm Neurath to continue with Operation Winter Exercise Following Neuraths advice Hitler inquired whether the French forces had actually crossed the border and when informed that they had not he assured Blomberg that Germany would wait until this happened In marked contrast to Blomberg who was highly nervous during Operation Winter Exercise Neurath stayed calm and very much urged Hitler to stay the course

The Rhineland coup is often seen as the moment when Hitler could have been stopped with very little effort the German forces involved in the move were small compared to the much larger and at the time more powerful French military The American journalist William L Shirer wrote if the French had marched into the Rhineland

A German officer assigned to the Bendlerstrasse during the crisis told H R Knickerbocker during the Spanish Civil War I can tell you that for five days and five nights not one of us closed an eye We knew that if the French marched we were done We had no fortifications and no army to match the French If the French had even mobilized we should have been compelled to retire The general staff the officer said considered Hitlers action suicidal General Heinz Guderian a German general interviewed by French officers after the Second World War claimed If you French had intervened in the Rhineland in 1936 we should have been sunk and Hitler would have fallen

That Hitler faced serious opposition gains apparent weight from the fact that Ludwig Beck and Werner von Fritsch did indeed become opponents of Hitler but according to the American historian Ernest May there is not a scrap of evidence for this at this stage May wrote that the German Army officer corps was all for remilitarizing the Rhineland and only the question of timing of such a move divided them from Hitler May further noted that there is no evidence that the German Army was planning on overthrowing Hitler if he had been forced to order a withdraw from the Rhineland and the fact that Mussolini utterly humiliated Hitler during the July Putsch in 1934 by forcing Germany to climbdown on Austria without leading to the slightest effort on the part of the Reichswehr to overthrow Hitler must cast further doubt on the thesis that Hitler would have been toppled if only he been forced to withdraw from the Rhineland

Writing about relations between Hitler and his generals in early 1936 the American historian JT Emerson declared In fact at no time during the twelveyear existence of the Third Reich did Hitler enjoy more amicable relations with his generals than in 1935 and 1936 During these years there was nothing like an organized military resistance to party politics Later on in World War II despite the increasing desperate situation of Germany from 1942 onwards and a whole series of humiliating defeats the overwhelming majority of the Wehrmacht stayed loyal to the Nazi regime and continued to fight hard for that regime right up to its destruction in 1945 the only exception being the putsch of July 20 1944 in which only a minority of the Wehrmacht rebelled while the majority remained loyal The willingness of the Wehrmacht to continue to fight and die hard for the National Socialist regime despite the fact Germany was clearly losing the war from 1943 onwards reflected the deep commitment of most of the Wehrmacht to National Socialism

Furthermore the senior officers of the Wehrmacht were deeply corrupt men who received huge bribes from Hitler in exchange for their loyalty In 1933 Hitler had created a slush fund known as Konto 5 run by Hans Lammers which provided bribes to senior officers and civil servants in exchange for their loyalty to the National Socialist regime Given the intense devotion of the Wehrmacht to the National Socialist regime and its corrupt senior officers who never got quite enough in the way of bribes from Hitler it is very unlikely that the Wehrmacht would have turned on their Fuhrer if the Wehrmacht were forced out of the Rhineland in 1936

On 7 March 1936 Hitler announced before the Reichstag that the Rhineland had been remilitarized and to blunt the danger of war Hitler offered to return to the League of Nations to sign an air pact to outlaw bombing as a way of war and a nonaggression pact with France if the other powers agreed to accept the remilitarization In his address to the Reichstag Hitler began with a lengthy denunciation of the Treaty of Versailles as unfair to Germany claimed that he was a man of peace who wanted war with noone and argued that he was only seeking equality for Germany by peacefully overturning the unfair Treaty of Versailles Hitler claimed that it was unfair that because of Versailles a part of Germany should be demilitarized whereas in every other nation of the world a government could order its troops to anywhere within its borders and claimed all he wanted was equality for Germany Even then Hitler claimed that he would have been willing to accept the continued demilitarization of the Rhineland as Stresemann had promised at Locarno in 1925 as the price for peace had it not been for the FrancoSoviet Pact of 1935 which he maintained was threatening to Germany and had left him with no other choice than to remilitarize the Rhineland With his eye on public opinion abroad Hitler made a point of stressing that the remilitarization was not intended to threaten anyone else but was instead only a defensive measure imposed on Germany by what he claimed were the menacing actions of France and the Soviet Union At least some people abroad accepted Hitlers claim that he been forced to take this step because of the FrancoSoviet pact Former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George stated in the House of Commons that Hitlers actions in the wake of the FrancoSoviet pact were fully justified and he would have been a traitor to Germany if he had not protected his country

When German troops marched into Cologne a vast cheering crowd formed spontaneously to greet the soldiers throwing flowers onto the Wehrmacht while Catholic priests offered to bless the soldiers Cardinal Karl Joseph Schulte of Cologne held a Mass at Cologne Cathedral to celebrate and thank Hitler for sending back our army In Germany the news that the Rhineland had been remilitarized was greeted with wild celebrations all over the country the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw wrote of March 1936 that People were besides themselves with delight  It was almost impossible not to be caught up in the infectious mood of joy Not until the victory over France in June 1940 was the Nazi regime to be as popular as it was in March 1936 Reports to the Sopade in the spring of 1936 mentioned that a great many erstwhile Social Democrats and opponents of the Nazis amongst the working class had nothing but approval of the remilitarization and that many who had once been opposed to the Nazis under the Weimar Republic were now beginning to support them 

To capitalize on the vast popularity of the remilitarization Hitler called a referendum on 29 March 1936 in which the majority of German voters expressed their approval of the remilitarization During his campaign stops to ask for a yes vote Hitler was greeted with huge crowds roaring their approval of his defiance of Versailles Kershaw wrote that the 99 ja yes vote in the referendum was improbably high but it is clear that an overwhelming majority of voters did genuinely chose to vote yes when asked if they approved of the remilitarization The American journalist William L Shirer wrote about the 1936 election Nevertheless this observer who covered the election from one corner of the Reich to the other has no doubt that the vote of approval for Hitlers coup was overwhelming And why not The junking of Versailles and the appearance of German soldiers marching again into what was after all German territory were things that almost all Germans naturally approved of The No vote was given as 540 211 In the aftermath of the remilitarization the economic crisis which had so damaged the National Socialist regimes popularity was forgotten by almost all After the Rhineland triumph Hitlers selfconfidence surged to new heights and those who knew him well stated that after March 1936 there was a real psychological change as Hitler was utterly convinced of his infallibility in a way that he not been before

Historians writing without benefit of access to the French archives which were not opened until the mid1970s such as William L Shirer in his books The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich 1960 and The Collapse of the Third Republic 1969 have claimed that France although possessing at this time superior armed forces compared to Germany including after a possible mobilization 100 infantry divisions was psychologically unprepared to use force against Germany Shirer quoted the figure of France having 100 divisions compared to Germanys 19 battalions in the Rhineland Frances actions during the Rhineland crisis have often used as support of the dcadence thesis that during the interwar period the supposed decadence of the French way of life caused the French people to degenerate physically and morally to the point that the French were simply unable to stand up to Hitler and the French in some way had it coming when they were defeated in 1940 Shirer wrote that the French could have easily turned back the German battalions in the Rhineland had the French people not been sinking into defeatism in 1936 Historians such as the American historian Stephen A Schuker who have examined the relevant French primary sources have rejected Shirers claims finding that a major paralyzing factor on French policy was the economic situation Frances top military official General Maurice Gamelin informed the French government that the only way to remove the Germans from the Rhineland was to mobilize the French Army which would not only be unpopular it would also cost the French treasury 30 million francs per day Gamelin assumed a worstcase scenario in which a French move into the Rhineland would spark an allout FrancoGerman war a case which required full mobilization Gamelins analysis was supported by the War Minister General Louis Maurin who told the Cabinet that it was inconceivable that France could reverse the German remilitarization without full mobilization This was especially the case as the Deuxime Bureau had seriously exaggerated the number of German troops in the Rhineland sending in a report to the French cabinet estimating that there were 295000 German troops in the Rhineland The Deuxime Bureau had come up with this estimate by counting all of the SS SA and Landespolizei formations in the Rhineland as regular troops and so the French believed only by full mobilization would France have enough troops to expel the alleged 295000 German troops from the Rhineland The real number was actually 3000 German soldiers The French historian JeanBaptiste Duroselle accused Gamelin of distorting what the Deuxime Bureaus intelligence in his report to the cabinet by converting the SS SA and Landespolizei units into fully trained troops to provide a reason for inaction Neuraths truthful statement that Germany had only sent 19 battalions into the Rhineland was dismissed by Gamelin as a ruse to allow Germans to claim that they had not committed a flagrant violation of Locarno in order to avoid having Locarno invoked against Germany and that Hitler would never risk a war by sending such a small force into the Rhineland 
At the same time in late 1935early 1936 France was gripped by a financial crisis with the French Treasury informing the government that sufficient cash reserves to maintain the value of the franc as currently pegged by the gold standard in regard to the US dollar and the British pound no longer existed and only a huge foreign loan on the money markets of London and New York could prevent the value of the franc from experiencing a disastrous downfall Because France was on the verge of elections scheduled for the spring of 1936 devaluation of the franc which was viewed as abhorrent by large sections of French public opinion was rejected by the caretaker government of Premier Albert Sarraut as politically unacceptable Investor fears of a war with Germany were not conducive to raising the necessary loans to stabilize the franc the German remilitarization of the Rhineland by sparking fears of war worsened the French economic crisis by causing a massive cash flow out of France as worried investors shifted their savings towards what were felt to be safer foreign markets The fact that France had defaulted on its World War I debts in 1932 understandably led most investors to conclude if France should be involved in another war with Germany the French would default again on their debts On March 18 1936 Wilfrid Baumgartner the director of the Mouvement gnral des fonds the French equivalent of a permanent undersecretary reported to the government that France for all intents and purposes was bankrupt Only by desperate armtwisting from the major French financial institutions did Baumgartner manage to obtain enough in the way of shortterm loans to prevent France from defaulting on her debts and keeping the value of the franc from sliding too far in March 1936 Given the financial crisis the French government feared that there were insufficient funds to cover the costs of mobilization and that a fullblown war scare caused by mobilization would only exacerbate the financial crisis The American historian Zach Shore wrote that It was not lack of French will to fight in 1936 which permitted Hitlers coup but rather Frances lack of funds military might and therefore operational plans to counter German remilitarization

An additional issue for the French was the state of the Arme de lAir The Deuxime Bureau reported that not only had the Luftwaffe developed considerably more advanced aircraft than what France possessed but owing to the superior productivity of German industry and the considerably larger size of the German economy the Luftwaffe had a three to one advantage in fighters Problems with productivity within the French aircraft industry meant the French air force would have a great deal of trouble replacing their losses in the event of combat with the Luftwaffe Thus it was believed by the French military elite that should war come then the Luftwaffe would dominate the skies and not only attack French troops marching into the Rhineland but bomb French cities Yet another problem for the French were the attitudes of the states of the cordon sanitaire Since 1919 it had accepted that France needed the alliance system in Eastern Europe to provide additional manpower Germanys population was one and half times the size of Frances and to open up an eastern front against the Reich Without the states of the cordon sanitaire it was believed impossible for France to defeat Germany Only Czechoslovakia indicated firmly that it would go to war with Germany if France marched into the Rhineland while Poland Romania and Yugoslavia all indicated that they would only to go to war if German soldiers entered France French public opinion and newspapers were very hostile towards the German coup but few called for war The majority of the French newspapers called for League of Nations sanctions to be imposed on the Reich to inflict such economically crippling costs as to force the German Army out of the Rhineland and for France to build new and reinforce the existing alliances with the aim of preventing further German challenges to the international status quo One of the few newspapers to support Germany was the royalist LAction Franaise which ran a banner headline reading The Republic Has Assassinated the Peace and went on to say that the German move was justified by the FrancoSoviet pact On the other ideological extreme the Communists issued a statement calling for national unity against those who would lead us to carnage who were the Laval clique who were allegedly pushing for a war with Germany because war was supposedly good for capitalism

Upon hearing of the German move the French government issued a statement strongly hinting that military action was a possible option From 930 am until noon on 7 March a meeting of the French cabinet took place to discuss what to do which ended with the conclusion that the French Foreign Minister Pierre tienne Flandin should meet the ambassadors of the Locarno powers to discuss their reaction Georges Mandel was the sole voice in the French cabinet demanding that France should march at once into the Rhineland to expel the German troops regardless of the costs Later that day another cabinet meeting was called with GeneralSecretary Alexis St Leger representing the Quai dOrsay and Maurice Gamelin the military who decided to issue the statement saying France reserved every option to oppose the remilitarization Flandin upon hearing of the remilitarization immediately went to London to consult the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin as Flandin wished for domestic political reasons to find a way of shifting the onus of not taking action onto British shoulders Baldwin asked Flandin what the French Government had in mind but Flandin said they had not yet decided Flandin went back to Paris and consulted the French Government what their response should be They agreed that France would place all her forces at the disposal of the League of Nations to oppose a violation of the Treaties On 8 March the Premier Albert Sarraut went on French radio to state In the name of the French government I declare that we intend to see maintained that essential guarantee of French and Belgian security countersigned by the English and Italian governments constituted by the Treaty of Locarno We are not disposed to allow Strasbourg to come under fire from German guns At the same time the French cabinet had decided that We will put all our forces material and moral at the disposal of the League of Nationson the one condition that we shall be accompanied in the fight for peace by those who are clearly bound themselves to do so by the Rhineland pact In other words France would act against Germany only if Britain and Italy acted likewise

Since the French government for economic reasons had already ruled out mobilization and hence war as a way of reversing Hitlers Rhineland coup it was decided that the best that France could do under the situation was to use the crisis to obtain the continental commitment ie a British commitment to send large ground forces to the defense of France on the same scale of World War I The strategy of Flandin was to strongly imply to the British that France was willing to go to war with Germany over the Rhineland issue in the expectation that the British were not willing to see their Locarno commitments lead them into a war with the Germans over an issue where many in Britain felt that the Germans were in the right As such Flandin expected London to apply pressure for restraint on Paris The price of the French restraint in regards to the Rhineland provocation an open violation of both the Versailles and Locarno treaties was to be the British continental commitment unequivocally linking British security to French security and committing the British to send another large expeditionary force to defend France in the event of a German attack

During his visit to London to consult with the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden Flandin carried out what the Canadian historian Robert J Young called the performance of a lifetime in which he expressed a great deal of outrage at the German move stated quite openly that France was prepared to go to war over the issue and strongly criticized his British hosts for the demands for French restraint while not offering to do anything for French scurit security As expected by Flandin Eden was opposed to the French taking military action and appealed for French restraint Not aware of what Flandin was attempting to do French military officials urged the government to tell Flandin to tone down his language In the face of Flandins tactics on March 19 1936 the British government made a vague statement linking British security to French security and for the first time since World War I agreed to AngloFrench staff talks albeit of very limited scope Though disappointed with the British offers which the French felt were too little the French nonetheless considered the pledges of British support gained in 1936 to be a worthwhile achievement especially given that for economic reasons mobilization was not considered a realistic option in 1936 Those French officials such as Quai dOrsays directeur politique Political Director Ren Massigli who believed in the idea of an AngloFrench alliance as the best way of stopping German expansionism expressed a great deal of disappointment that Britain was not prepared to do more for French scurit In a report to Flandin Massigli warned that if French accepted remilitarization then the Poles the Yugoslavs and the Romanians would drift into the German orbit while Czechoslovakia would do its best to stay loyal to its 1924 alliance with France and it would only be a matter of time before Germany annexed Austria In particular Massigli warned if the Germans were able to fortify the Rhineland that would essentially mean giving the Reich a free hand to expand into Eastern Europe As part of an effort to secure more in the way of the longdesired continental commitment that had been a major goal of French foreign policy since 1919 Gamelin told the British military attach that

The generalissimo of the French Army General Gamelin told the French government that if France countered the German forces and this caused a long war France would be unable to win fighting alone and therefore would need British assistance The French Government with an upcoming general election in mind decided against general mobilization of the French Army The remilitarization removed the last hold France had over Germany and therefore ended the security France had gained from the Treaty of Versailles As long as the Rhineland was demilitarized the French could easily reoccupy the area and threaten the economically important Ruhr industrial area which was liable to French invasion if France believed the situation in Germany ever became a threat

The reaction in Britain was mixed but they did not generally regard the remilitarization as harmful Lord Lothian famously said it was no more than the Germans walking into their own backyard George Bernard Shaw similarly claimed it was no different than if Britain had reoccupied Portsmouth In his diary entry for 23 March Harold Nicolson MP noted that the feeling in the House of Commons is terribly proGerman which means afraid of war During the Rhineland crisis of 1936 no public meetings or rallies were held anywhere in protest at the remilitarization of the Rhineland and instead there were several peace rallies where it was demanded that Britain not use war to resolve the crisis Ever since the economist John Maynard Keynes had published his bestselling book The Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919in which Keynes depicted Versailles as an unbearably harsh Carthaginian peace imposed by the vindictive Alliesan increasingly large segment of British public opinion had become convinced that the Treaty of Versailles was deeply unjust to Germany By 1936 when German troops marched back into the Rhineland the majority of British people believed that Hitler was right to violate the unjust Versailles treaty and it would be morally wrong for Britain to go to war to uphold the unjust Treaty of Versailles The British War Secretary Alfred Duff Cooper told the German Ambassador Leopold von Hoesch on 8 March through the British people were prepared to fight for France in the event of a German incursion into French territory they would not resort to arms on account of the recent occupation of the Rhineland The people did not know much about the demilitarization provisions and most of them probably took the view that they did not care two hoots about the Germans reoccupying their own territory

The Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin claimed with tears in his eyes that Britain lacked the resources to enforce her treaty guarantees and that public opinion would not stand for military force anyway The British Chiefs of Staff had warned that war with Germany was inadvisable under the grounds that the deep cuts imposed by the Ten Year Rule together with the fact that rearmament had only begun in 1934 meant that at most Britain could do in the event of war would be to send two divisions with backward equipment to France after three weeks of preparation Additionally fears were expressed in Whitehall if Britain went to war with Germany then Japan which since 1931 when Japanese had seized Manchuria from China had been making claims to be the only power in the Far East might take advantage of the war to start seizing Britains Asian colonies

The British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden discouraged military action by the French and was against any financial or economic sanctions against Germany immediately meeting the French ambassador Charles Corbin to urge restraint on the French Eden instead wanted Germany to pull out all but a symbolic number of troops the number they said they were going to put in the first place and then renegotiate An additional factor that influenced British policy was the lack of the Dominion support All of the Dominion High Commissioners in London with South Africa and Canada being especially outspoken in this regard made it quite clear that they would not go to war to restore the demilitarized status of the Rhineland and that if Britain did so she would be on her own The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that by 13 March that the British Dominions especially the Union of South Africa and Canada would not stand with England if war came The South African government in particular was busy backing the German position in London and with the other Dominion governments Both the South African Prime Minister General J B M Hertzog and the Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had to face domestic constituencies respectively the Afrikaners and the French Canadians many of whom had deep objections to fighting in another British war against Germany and as such both Hertzog and Mackenzie King were staunch supporters of appeasement as the best way of avoiding such a war Neither Hertzog nor Mackenzie King wished to have chose between loyalty to the British Empire vs dealing with antiBritish voters if war came Ever since the Chanak Crisis of 1922 Britain had been keenly conscious that Dominion support could no longer be automatically assumed and remembering the huge role the Dominions had played in the victory of 1918 could not consider fighting another major war without Dominion support

The British Foreign Office for its part expressed a great deal of frustration over Hitlers action in unilaterally taking what London had proposed to negotiate As a Foreign Office memo complained Hitler has deprived us of the possibility of making to him a concession which might otherwise have been a useful bargaining counter in our hands in the general negotiations with Germany which we had it in contemplation to initiate The Rhineland crisis completed the estrangement between Eden who believed that Hitlers proposals in his speech of 7 March were the grounds for a general settlement with Germany and Vansittart who argued that Hitler was negotiating in bad faith Eden and Vansittart had already clashed during the Abyssinia Crisis with Eden supporting sanctions against Italy while Vansittart wanted Italy as an ally against Germany Vansittart argued that there was no prospect of a general settlement with Hitler and the best that could be done was to strengthen ties with the French in order to confront Germany The Germanophobe Vansittart had always hated the Germans and especially disliked the Nazis whom he saw as a menace to civilization Vansittart had supported Edens efforts to defuse the Rhineland crisis as British rearmament had only just began but being an intense Francophile Vansittart urged the government to use the crisis as a chance to begin forming a military alliance with France against Germany By the spring of 1936 Vansittart had become convinced that a general settlement with Germany was not possible and Hitler was seeking the conquest of the world A Foreign Office official Owen OMalley suggested that Britain give Germany a free hand in the East ie accept the German conquest of all Eastern Europe in exchange for a German promise to accept the status quo in Western Europe Vansittart wrote in response that Hitler was seeking world conquest and that to allow Germany to conquer all of Eastern Europe would give the Reich sufficient raw materials to make Germany immune to a British blockade which would then allow the Germans to overrun Western Europe Vansittart commented that to allow Germany to conquer Eastern Europe would lead to the disappearance of liberty and democracy in Europe By contrast Eden saw British interests as confined only to Western Europe and did not share Vansittarts beliefs about what Hitlers ultimate intentions might be Nor did Eden the rest of the Cabinet or the majority of the British people share Vansittarts conviction that Britain could not afford to be indifferent about Eastern Europe

Though the British had agreed to staff talks with the French as the price of French restraint many British ministers were unhappy with these talks The Home Secretary Sir John Simon wrote to Eden and Baldwin that staff talks to be held with the French after the Rhineland remilitarization would lead the French to perceive that

In response to objections like Simons the British ended the staff talks with the French five days after they had begun AngloFrench staff talks were not to occur again until February 1939 in the aftermath of the Dutch War Scare of January 1939 Besides opposition within the cabinet the AngloFrench staff talks generated furious criticism from David Lloyd George and the Beaverbrook and Rothermere press who fumed as the Daily Mail put it in a leader over military arrangements that will commit us to some war at the call of others Furthermore Hitlers Extraordinary AmbassadoratLarge Joachim von Ribbentrop had warned Baldwin and Eden that Germany regarded the AngloFrench staff talks as a mortal threat and any hope of a general settlement with Germany would end forever if the talks continued However the rather hazily phrased British statement linking British security to French scurit was not disallowed out of the fear that it would irreparably damage AngloFrench relations which as the British historian A J P Taylor observed meant should France become involved in a war with Germany there would be at a minimum a strong moral case because of the statement of March 19 1936 for Britain to fight on the side of France

Until the statement by Neville Chamberlain on March 31 1939 offering the guarantee of Poland there were no British security commitments in Eastern Europe beyond the Covenant of the League of Nations However because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe the socalled Cordon sanitaire any German attack on Frances Eastern European allies would cause a FrancoGerman war and because of the statement of March 19 1936 a FrancoGerman war would create strong pressure for British intervention on the side of France This was all the more the case because unlike the Locarno where Britain was committed to come to Frances defence only in the event of a German attack the British statement of March 19 as part of an effort to be as vague as possible only stated Britain considered French security to be a vital national need and did not distinguish between a German attack on France vs France going to war with Germany in the event of a German attack on a member of the cordon sanitarie Thus in this way the British statement of March 1936 offered not only a direct British commitment to defend France albeit phrased in exceedingly ambiguous language but also indirectly to the Eastern European states of the cordon sanitaire In this way the British government found itself drawn into the Central European crisis of 1938 because the FrancoCzechoslovak alliance of 1924 meant any GermanCzechoslovak war would automatically become a FrancoGerman war It was because of this indirect security commitment that the British involved themselves in the Central European crisis of 1938 despite the widespread feeling that the GermanCzechoslovak dispute did not concern Britain directly

During a House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on 12 March Winston Churchill a backbench Conservative MP argued for AngloFrench coordination under the League of Nations to help France challenge the remilitarization of the Rhineland but this never happened On 6 April Churchill said of the remilitarization The creation of a line of forts opposite to the French frontier will enable the German troops to be economized on that line and will enable the main forces to swing round through Belgium and Holland accurately predicting the Battle of France

Belgium concluded an alliance with France in 1920 but after the remilitarization Belgium opted again for neutrality On 14 October 1936 King Leopold III of Belgium said in a speech

Poland announced that the FrancoPolish Military Alliance signed in 1921 would be honoured although the treaty stipulated that Poland would aid France only if France was invaded At the same time that Colonel Beck was assuring the French ambassador Lon Nol of his commitment to the FrancoPolish alliance and Polands willingness to stand with France he was also telling the German ambassador Count HansAdolf von Moltke that since Germany was not planning on invading France the FrancoPolish alliance would not come into effect and Poland would do nothing if France acted Beck made a point of stressing to Moltke that Poland had not been allowed to sign Locarno and would not go to war for Locarno and that as one of the architects of the GermanPolish nonaggression pact of 1934 that he was a friend of the Reich Beck told Moltke on 9 March that his promise to go to war with France was in practice without effect because it only came into effect if German troops entered France Weinberg wrote that Becks duplicity during the Rhineland crisis of telling the German and French ambassadors different things about what Poland would do  did nothing for Becks personal reputation and involved enormous risks  for Poland Poland did agree to mobilize its forces if France did first however they abstained from voting against the remilitarization in the Council of the League of Nations

During the Rhineland crisis the isolationist American government took a strict hands off policy of doing nothing During the crisis President Franklin D Roosevelt went off on a diplomatically convenient extended fishing trip to Florida to avoid having to answer questions from journalists about what his administration planned to do in response to the crisis in Europe The general sentiment within the US government was expressed by Truman Smith the American military attach in Berlin who wrote that Hitler was seeking only to end French domination in Europe and was not seeking to destroy France as a power Smiths report concluded Versailles is dead There may possibly be a German catastrophe and a new Versailles but it will not be the Versailles which has hung like a dark cloud over Europe since 1920

In public the Soviet government took a strong line in denouncing the German coup as a threat to peace At the same time the Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov was giving speeches before the General Assembly of the League of Nations praising collective security and urging the world to oppose Hitlers coup Soviet diplomats in Berlin were telling their counterparts at the Auswrtiges Amt of their desire for better commercial relations which in turn might lead to better political relations Just after the remilitarization the Soviet Premier Vyacheslav Molotov gave an interview with the Swiss newspaper Le Temps hinting that the Soviet Union wanted better relations with Germany In April 1936 the Soviet Union signed a commercial treaty with Germany providing for expanded GermanSoviet trade A major problem for the Soviet Union to go to war with Germany was the lack of a common GermanSoviet frontier which would require both the Polish and Romanian governments to grant transit right to the Red Army Despite their professed willingness to engage with the Wehrmacht the Narkomindel tended to negotiate with the Poles and the Romanians over transit rights in the event of a war in such a manner to suggest that they wanted the talks to fail suggesting that the Soviet hard line against Germany was just posturing The Romanians and even more so the Poles expressed a great deal of fear that if the Red Army were allowed transit rights to enter their countries on the way to fight Germany that they would fail to leave once the war was over the Narkomindel failed to provide convincing reassurances on that point

When the Council of the League of Nations met in London the only delegate in favour of sanctions against Germany was Maxim Litvinov the representative of the Soviet Union Though Germany was no longer a member of the League Ribbentrop was allowed to give a speech before the League Assembly on 19 March where he tried to justify Germanys actions as something imposed on the Reich by the FrancoSoviet pact and warned that there would be serious economic consequences for those states who voted to impose sanctions on Germany By 1936 a number of Eastern European Scandinavian and Latin American countries whose economies were hardpressed by the Great Depression had become very dependent upon trade with Germany to keep their economies afloat which meant for economic reasons alone none of those states wished to offend Germany President Federico Pez of Ecuador gave a speech in which he declared the idea of sanctions against the Reich to be nonsensical At the time the British Foreign Office estimated that Britain France Romania Belgium Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were the only nations in the entire world willing to impose sanctions on Germany The Swedish Danish Norwegian Polish Dutch Greek Swiss Turkish Chilean Estonian Portuguese Spanish and Finnish ambassadors to the League all let it be known that they regarded sanctions on Germany as economic suicide for their countries Mussolini who was still angry with the League sanctions applied against Italy made a speech in which he made it clear that he definitely would not be joining any sanctions against Germany for remilitarizing the Rhineland In the fall of 1935 Britain had been able to have the League impose limited sanctions on Italy but by the later winter of 1936 the idea of imposing sweeping sanctions on Germanywhose economy was four times the size of Italys making Germany an economic octopus whose tentacles were everywhere around the worldwas unthinkable for rest of the world Moreover for the sanctions to work the United States had to join in In 1935 the American government had declared that as the US was not a League member it would not abide by the League sanctions on Italy which was hardly a hopeful precedent for the idea that US would join in with imposing sanctions on Germany Argentina declared that it would vote for sanctions against Germany only if the United States promised to join in The Council declared though not unanimously that the remilitarization constituted a breach of the Treaties of Versailles and Locarno Hitler was invited to plan a new scheme for European security and he responded by claiming he had no territorial claims in Europe and wanted a 25year pact of nonaggression with Britain and France However when the British Government inquired further into this proposed pact they did not receive a reply

The remilitarization changed the balance of power decisively in favor of the Reich French credibility in standing against German expansion or aggression was left in doubt French military strategy was entirely defensive and it had no intention whatsoever of invading Germany Instead it planned to defend the Maginot Line Its failure to send even a single unit into Rhineland signaled that strategy to all of Europe Potential allies in Eastern Europe could no longer trust in an alliance with a France that could not be trusted to deter Germany through threat of an invasion without such deterrence the ally was militarily helpless Belgium dropped its defensive alliance with France and relied on neutrality Paris neglected to expand the Maginot line to cover the Belgian border which is where Germany invaded in 1940 Mussolini had previously pushed back against German expansion now he realized cooperation with France was unpromising so he began instead to swing in favor of Berlin All of Frances friends were disappointed  even the Pope told the French ambassador that Had you ordered the immediate advance of 200000 men into the zone the Germans had occupied you would have done everyone a very great favor

With the Rhineland remilitarized Germany started the construction of the Siegfried Line which meant that if Germany attacked any of the states in the cordon sanitaire the ability of France to threaten an invasion was henceforward limited Such was the impact of the remilitarization on the balance of power that the Czechoslovak President Edvard Bene seriously considered renouncing the alliance with France and instead seeking a rapprochement with Germany only abandoning that idea when it become clear that the price of a rapprochement with Hitler would be the effective loss of his countrys independence Likewise King Carol II of Romania concluded that Romania might have to abandon its alliance with France and instead accept that his country would have to move from being in the French sphere of influence to being in the German sphere of influence When William C Bullitt the newly appointed American ambassador to France visited Germany in May 1936 he met with Baron von Neurath On 18 May 1936 Bullitt reported to President Roosevelt that Von Neurath said that it was the policy of the German government to do nothing active in foreign affairs until the Rhineland had been digested He explained that he meant that until the German fortifications had been constructed on the French and Belgian borders the German government would do everything possible to prevent rather than encourage an outbreak by Nazis in Austria and would pursue a quiet line with regard to Czechoslovakia As soon as our fortifications are constructed and the countries of Central Europe realize that France cannot enter German territory at will all those countries will begin to feel very differently about their foreign policies and a new constellation will develop he said Between the 1520 June 1936 the chiefs of staff of the Little Entente of Czechoslovakia Romania and Yugoslavia met to discuss the changed international situation They decided to maintain their present plans for a war with Hungary but concluded that with the Rhineland now remilitarized there was little hope of effective French action in the event of a war with Germany The meeting ended with the conclusion that there now were only two great powers in Eastern Europe namely Germany and the Soviet Union and the best that could be hoped for was to avoid another war that would almost certainly mean the loss of their nations independence regardless of who won Weinberg wrote that attitude of the entire German elite and much of the German people that any new war would only benefit Germany and that ending the Rhinelands demilitarized status could only be a good thing as it opened the door to starting a new war was an extremely shortsighted selfdestructive and stupid attitude even from a narrowly German viewpoint Weinberg notes that Germany lost its independence in 1945 and lost far more territory under the OderNeisse line imposed in 1945 than it ever had under Versailles together with millions of dead and the destruction of its cities Thus from the German viewpoint the best thing to do would have been to accept Versailles rather than start a new warone which ended with Germany being totally crushed partitioned and occupied

Bird Island North Carolina
Bird Island is approximately adjacent to the coastal resort town of Sunset Beach North Carolina USA Sunset Beach is on a barrier island and is the southernmost town in North Carolina Bird Island can be reached by walking along the seashore toward the South Carolina border Due to the contour of the Atlantic Coast at this point the direction of travel to Bird Island is approximately WestSouthwest Previously Bird Island was separated from Sunset Beach by a tidal creek Mad Inlet that could be easily crossed only at low tide Accretion of ocean sand due to hurricane activity in the 1990s as well as environmental activity to fill in dune grass has gradually filled in the tidal creek so that two separate islands became one

Bird Island was privately owned prior to 2002 The shoreline dunes and marshland of Bird Island provide important habitat and nesting for species that are endangered threatened or of special concern including the Kemps Ridley and Loggerhead sea turtles Although there was no vehicular access to this land there was the threat that the land might some day be developed The state of North Carolina used 42 million of public and private funding to purchase the land and create a coastal reserve administered by the North Carolina Division of Coastal Management

To help Steele obtain additional art training in Europe his friend and art patron Herman Lieber arranged to provide financial support for the family so Steele could study at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich In exchange for future paintings from Steele thirteen patrons each pledged 100 to support Steeles studies In 1880 the Steele family sailed to Europe with fellow Hoosiers J Ottis Adams Carrie Wolf August Metzner and Samuel Richards The group was joined two years later by Hoosier artist William Forsyth In addition to training at the Royal Academy under the instruction of artists Gyula Benczr and Ludwig Lfftz Steele spent hours studying paintings of the Old Masters in Munichs Alte Pinakothek galleries He also painted in the countryside with his family and other artists including Boston landscape painter J Frank Currier Steele enjoyed plein air or outdoor painting which is reflected in many of his landscapes At Steeles request his sponsors extended their financial support so that he could continue studies in Munich for two more years Steele also used funds earned from painting copies of Old Masters to pay for several additional months before the family returned to Indiana in 1885

Upon their return to Indianapolis the Steele family rented the Tinker mansion Talbott Place at Sixteenth and Pennsylvania Streets Steele kept a studio downtown where he could paint and display his work while he earned a living primarily as a portrait painter and art teacher Around 1886 Steele had a studio built on the Tinker property and the home already an Indianapolis landmark became a hub for the local arts community

Steeles paintings showed a notable change in style after his return from Munich Steeles Munich paintings sported dark drab colors and high contrasts but his work in Indiana gradually shifted toward a brighter more vivid color palette Steele was especially interested in capturing the beauty of nature through expressions of light and color His paintings included both urban and rural scenes and depicted changes of season as well as weather conditions of snow rain and sunshine Steeles works show a sympathic and technical grasp of his subjects with a comprehension of the majestic aspects of nature with much feeling for the influence of light and atmosphere

In addition to local exhibitions Steeles art appeared outside of Indiana including the Eighth Annual Exhibition of the prestigious Society of American Artists at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City in 1886 During the summer months Steele took his family to the country where he painted rural landscapes The Muscatatuck River near Vernon Indiana was a favorite locale Fellow landscape artist Forsyth frequently accompanied Steele on these expeditions Steele also painted in Vermont and Tennessee where he had taken his first wife Libby in hopes of improving her health

The 1890s were a turning point in Steeles career In 1890 Steele published The Steele Portfolio which contained twentyfive photogravure prints of his paintings including The Boatman his prizewinning student work from Munich In 1891 Forsyth joined Steele as an instructor at the Indiana Art School which Steele established in 1889 Steele continued to teach there until 1895 before returning to painting on a fulltime basis In November 1894 the Art Association of Indianapolis sponsored the Exhibit of Summer Work by Steele Forsyth Richard B Gruelle and Otto Stark The exhibition so impressed art critic and novelist Hamlin Garland that he arranged to have the exhibition shown in Chicago Sponsored by the Central Art Association the Indiana exhibit called Five Hoosier Painters expanded to include paintings by Adams This Chicago exhibition is credited with launching the careers of the Hoosier Group of Indiana painters

Throughout the 1890s Steele painted landscapes during the warm months and returned to a winter studio to paint portraits still his primary source of income In addition Steele actively exhibited his work delivered lectures and helped organize the Society of Western Artists whose annual exhibition attracted national attention Steele later became the organizations president Steele painted outdoors near Vernon then moved on to Bloomington in Monroe County Indiana and Metamora in Franklin County Indiana where he did some of his best work The area around Metamora was instrumental in the development of Hoosier landscape painting Fellow landscape painters Adams Forsyth Stark and others joined Steele as he painted outdoors In 1898 Steele and Adams bought a home in Brookville Indiana eight miles east of Metamora so they could be closer to the areas scenic beauty Named The Hermitage the home was quiet secluded and provided a place where the artists could work without interruption In 1899 Steele became a member of the jury that selected American paintings for inclusion in the Paris Universal Exposition in 1900 a worlds fair expected to attract millions of visitors Sadly Steeles wife Libby died at the age of fortynine in November 1899

The new century marked a number of changes in Steeles life In 1900 he received an honorary master of arts degree from Wabash College in Crawfordsville Indiana That same year the Art Association of Indianapolis received a large donation from John Herron to establish a museum and art school in the city The association selected the Tinker mansion Steeles home in Indianapolis and purchased the property from his landlord Steeles art studio became the first Herron School of Art Steele leased another home on East Saint Clair Street in Indianapolis Portrait commissions remained a major source of income for Steele and his subjects included poet James Whitcomb Riley the official portraits of several Indiana governors President Benjamin Harrison and other prominent Hoosiers

In 1902 Steele and his daughter Daisy traveled to the West Coast to visit family in Oregon and Redlands California The crosscounty trip inspired Steele to paint more than a dozen exceptional works of art He entered several of his West Coast paintings in the Society of Western Artists Sixth Annual Exhibition which was well received by art critics Steele and his daughter made another crosscountry trip in 1903 A year later Steele was invited to be a juror on the selection committee of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition the 1904 worlds fair at Saint Louis Four of Steeles paintings were selected for the exposition and an additional five paintings were shown in the Indiana Building At home in Indianapolis Steele became actively involved in plans for the Art Associations new museum serving as chair of the acquisitions committee The Tinker house was demolished in 1905 to make space for the Herron Art Institute In 1906 Steele sold his interest in The Hermitage at Brookville to Adams and returned to Indianapolis where he remained active in the arts community

As Steele explored new places to paint he discovered an isolated area of Brown County Indiana where he built a hilltop studiohome on of land one and a half miles south of Belmont between Bloomington and Nashville Indiana Steele moved into the new summer residence with his second wife Selma in August 1907 Inspired by the breezes blowing through the cottages screened porches they named it the House of the Singing Winds The land while not suitable for agricultural purpose provided Steele with beautiful picturesque woods and hills and valleys

Slowly over time the Steeles developed their Brown County property acquiring additional acreage to increase it to a total of of land and making further improvements to include an enlarged home and surround it with beautiful gardens a barnsized studiogallery and several other outbuildings The couple made it their yearround residence in 1912

Steele kept a studio in Indianapolis but his home in rural Brown County increasingly attracted visitors and other artists to the area Despite its remote location visitors came out of curiosity to see the scenic beauty surrounding the painters home Steeles presence in Brown County along with other fulltime resident artists such as Will Vawter Gustave Baumann Dale Bessire and others helped attract newcomers to the growing Brown County Art Colony

Steeles reputation in the art world continued to rise In 1913 he was elected as an associate artist to the National Academy of Design in New York confirming Steeles standing as the most famous Hoosier artist of his time Three of his paintings were accepted in the prestigious PanamaPacific International Exposition in San Francisco California in 1915

In 1922 Steele accepted an appointment as Indiana Universitys first artist in residence Steele and his wife Selma rented a home in Bloomington Indiana during the winter months but returned to their home in Brown County each summer On campus Steele kept a studio on the top floor of IUs University Library now Franklin Hall where he and his wife greeted visitors and students could watch him paint

Steele continued to exhibit his art including a major exhibition called the Hoosier Salon held in Chicago and organized by The Daughters of Indiana He also maintained a busy lecture schedule

In December 1925 Steele suffered a heart attack Although he recovered and continued to paint he became ill the following June and died at home in Brown County on July 24 1926 His ashes were buried on a hillside that was reserved for a family cemetery the T C Steele Memorial Cemetery on the Steeles property near Belmont in Brown County Indiana

Sunday in New York
Sunday in New York is a 1963 American Metrocolor romantic comedy film directed by Peter Tewksbury and starring Jane Fonda Rod Taylor and Cliff Robertson The soundtrack score was composed and performed by Peter Nero although Mel Torm contributed the vocals for the title song

Eileen Tyler Fonda a 22yearold music critic for the Albany Times Union is suffering from her breakup with Russ Robert Culp from a rich Albany family She comes to New York City to visit her brother Adam Robertson who is an airline pilot Eileen confides to her brother that she thinks she may be the only 22yearold virgin left in the world Adam assures her that sex is not what all men look for and insists he hasnt slept around Of course Adam is lying and is in hot pursuit of a tryst with his occasional girlfriend Mona However Adams date with Mona has a series of jobrelated interruptions Meanwhile Eileen decides to see if she can have some fun in New York and seems to find the perfect candidate in Mike Taylor a man she meets on the bus But things get complicated when Russ pops in with a proposal and a mistaken assumption Mike later confesses to Eileen his feelings whereby she has a change of heart


The screenplay by Norman Krasna was adapted from his play which had been produced on Broadway by David Merrick starring Robert Redford and directed by Garson Kanin It ran for 188 performances

Hedda Hopper reported in November 1960 that Krasna was writing the play in Switzerland where he had a home The play was optioned by David Merrick who arranged Garson Kanin to direct Kanin had directed Krasnas script for Bachelor Mother in 1939 Kanin called it Krasnas best play with a lot of feeling and very funny 

Peter Graves and Jane Fonda were discussed as leads in the play Then in May 1961 Carroll Baker was mooted as star Baker ended up going into Come on Strong a play written by Kanin The lead roles went to Pat Stanley Robert Redford and Conrad Janis Rehearsals took place in October 1961

The New York Times called it inventive and chic Only the substance is familiar and thin Walter Kerr called it a sentimentalised farce precisely the kind of echo chamber exercise that drives intelligent young theatregoers to complete despair

The show closed in May 1962 after 189 performances

The play ran for two years in Paris and had a successful run in Los Angeles in a production starring Marlo Thomas
The show was seen by Eliot Hyman and Ray Stark of Seven Arts Productions who thought it would make a good movie according to Stark Other companies were interested in film rights but they called Krasna direct in Switzerland and did the deal The rights cost 150000 plus a percentage of the gross

The film was a part of a multipicture deal between Seven Arts and MGM Lead roles originally were offered to Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty who turned them down

Peter Tewksbury best known for his work in TV signed to direct

In a review of the playwrights frank screen version of the play Bosley Crowther characterized the film as another in a series of films that dwelled on a subject first brought to the screen ten years earlier in The Moon Is Blue There once was a time when the candor of Mr Krasnas mildly popular Broadway play about an Albany girl who struggles bravely with the problem of her virtue during a rainy afternoon in New York might have caused the Production Code people a moment or two of anxious pause They might then have thought it a bit too racy for youthful and innocent ears on the film itself Crowther said the extent of the films disconcertion and delight for a viewer will depend upon how prone one may be to a juvenile quandary and to the nimble performing of a pleasant cast The twists of the plot are downright hackneyedthe confusions of opening the wrong doors mistaking people and getting caught in dishabille But the actors are all attractive and so long as one can go along with them in their valiant attempts at pretending this is hot stuff one may have a good time

According to Time magazine Sunday in New York is another brightly salacious Hollywood comedy about the way of a man with a maid who just may This motion picture leers an announcement flashed on the screen as a teaser is dedicated to the proposition that every girl getssooner or later As usual winking wickedness turns out to be mostly eyewash but the plotmore to be pitied than censoredgets a buoyant lift from stars Jane Fonda Cliff Robertson and Rod Taylor All three abandon themselves to the film version of Norman Krasnas trite Broadway farce with disarming faith as though one more glossy glittering package of pseudo sex might save the world

Any Wednesday
Any Wednesday is a 1966 American Technicolor romantic comedy film starring Jane Fonda Jason Robards and Dean Jones It was directed by Robert Ellis Miller from a screenplay by producer Julius J Epstein based on the hit play of the same name by Muriel Resnik which played on Broadway for 984 performances from 1964 to 1966 The film was titled Bachelor Girl Apartment in the UK

The story centers on a Manhattan woman Fonda who is trying to decide between two suitors one married Robards and one not Jones on the day of her 30th birthday

John Cleves Jason Robards is a businessman with an office in New York and a home in New Jersey On one day of each week Wednesday he spends the night in the city lying to wife Dorothy Rosemary Murphy that he is out of town on business when he actually is seeing Ellen his mistress Jane Fonda

A business client from Akron Ohio Cass Henderson Dean Jones comes to town and is unable to find a hotel room for the night Cleves new secretary knows of an executive suite the boss maintains in town so Cass is sent there for the night When he meets Ellen he mistakenly assumes she is a certain kind of lady hired by Cleves to entertain him

The secretary compounds the error by telling Dorothy about the apartment Dorothy goes there and discovers Ellen and Cass assuming them to be a young couple The women take a liking to each other so Dorothy invites them to spend an evening out on the town with her and John

Dorothy eventually catches on to what her husband is up to and leaves him Ellen invites her to use the apartment John goes there and tries to win his wifes love back but she just tells her husband to come visit her on any Wednesday


Exterior location scenes for Any Wednesday were filmed in Manhattan New York City

During the course of the 28month run of the play Any Wednesday on Broadway the role of Ellen was played by Sandy Dennis  who won a Tony Award for her performance  and Barbara Cook Don Porter and Gene Hackman also appeared in it

Richard F Shepard of The New York Times was fairly positive writing that the story had made the transition from stage to screen not much the worse for wear though he felt it might have been better if it were shorter The funny lines and there are a good number would have been even sharper Variety called it an outstanding sophisticated comedy with solid direction and excellent performances Philip K Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote Neither Jason Robards nor Jane Fonda strikes me particularly as a natural comedian whatever that may be and the timing of both seems off  In the case of Robards a superior actor whenever he is permitted to be I must admit to some surprise that he was willing to waste his time and talents on such a contrived and cinematically weak affair as this Richard L Coe of The Washington Post called Fonda miscast because she is simply not the sort of girl who doesnt know what she is doing He thought Rosemary Murphy stole the film with an immensely amusing performance The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote A moderately entertaining film version of a Broadway stage production but it could have been much more so if director Robert Ellis Miller had a lighter touch

Jane Fonda was nominated for a 1966 Golden Globe Award in the category Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture  Musical or Comedy

On August 18 2009 Warner Home Video released the movie on DVDR as part of the Warner Archive Collection

<doc id="7735022" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7735022" title="Cage graph theory">
Cage graph theory
In the mathematical area of graph theory a cage is a regular graph that has as few vertices as possible for its girth

Formally an rggraph is defined to be a graph in which each vertex has exactly r neighbors and in which the shortest cycle has length exactly g It is known that an rggraph exists for any combination of r  2 and g  3 An rgcage is an rggraph with the fewest possible number of vertices among all rggraphs

If a Moore graph exists with degree r and girth g it must be a cage Moreover the bounds on the sizes of Moore graphs generalize to cages any cage with odd girth g must have at least

vertices and any cage with even girth g must have at least

vertices Any rggraph with exactly this many vertices is by definition a Moore graph and therefore automatically a cage

There may exist multiple cages for a given combination of r and g For instance there are three nonisomorphic 310cages each with 70 vertices  the Balaban 10cage the Harries graph and the HarriesWong graph But there is only one 311cage  the Balaban 11cage with 112 vertices

A degreeone graph has no cycle and a connected degreetwo graph has girth equal to its number of vertices so cages are only of interest for r  3 The r3cage is a complete graph K on r1 vertices and the r4cage is a complete bipartite graph K on 2r vertices

Other notable cages include the Moore graphs

The numbers of vertices in the known rg cages for values of r  2 and g  2 other than projective planes and generalized polygons are
For large values of g the Moore bound implies that the number n of vertices must grow at least singly exponentially as a function of g Equivalently g can be at most proportional to the logarithm of n More precisely
It is believed that this bound is tight or close to tight  The best known lower bounds on g are also logarithmic but with a smaller constant factor implying that n grows singly exponentially but at a higher rate than the Moore bound Specifically the Ramanujan graphs satisfy the bound

This bound was improved slightly by 

It is unlikely that these graphs are themselves cages but their existence gives an upper bound to the number of vertices needed in a cage

Broad Sound is a large bay on the east coast of Australia in the state of Queensland 675km northwest of the state capital Brisbane It is about 50km long and 20km across at its widest point The Torilla Peninsula forms the eastern side of the bay Shoalwater Bay is on the other side of the peninsula 

British explorer James Cook in HMS Endeavour sighted the bay in May 1770 naming it for its size The next European navigator in the area was Matthew Flinders in HMS Investigator in 1802

The town of St Lawrence was established midway between Rockhampton and Mackay on St Lawrence Creek and developed as a port for the export of cattle from the hinterland with a large meatworks built close by in 1893 The processing and export of meat and cattle continued until 1919 when rail links were built elsewhere making the port redundant By 2006 the population of St Lawrence had dropped to 125 out of a population in the Broad Sound area of 268

The bay has a lowlying coastline with wide mudflats exposed at low tide and backed by extensive areas of mangroves The head of the bay has the greatest tidal range on Australias east coast  around 9m The coastline is punctuated by the mangrovelined estuaries of several rivers and creeks including Herbert and St Lawrence Creeks and the Styx River Behind the mangroves is a hinterland of low rounded hills covered by a mix of grassland and low eucalypt woodland or forest The climate is subtropical with a dry winter

The extensive tracts of mangroves and mudflats comprising some 1200km in the southern part of the bay have been classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area It supports globally important populations of the strawnecked ibis with up to 15000 individual birds Australian bustard Lathams snipe sharptailed sandpiper and mangrove honeyeater

At the peak of the Vietnam war upheaval in the United States in May 1968 Warner graduated from Yale University with a BA degree and intended to go to Yale medical school after leaving Yale undergraduate Without a college deferment Warner most likely would have been classified as 1A that is to say classified as available immediately for military service For example President Bush was classified as 1A on Bushs graduation from Yale in May 1968 and was accepted into the Texas Air National Guard at the height of the ongoing Vietnam War

With the Vietnam war and Yale medical school choices facing Warner Warner looked to a third option based on advice from his father an insurance man from Cincinnati Ohio Warners father advised Warner to go into business to develop some breadth and subsequently Warner entered the management training program at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in New York City At that time Morgan Guaranty Trust Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase  Co formerly JP Morgan  Co Incorporated Over the next seven years Warner rapidly advanced from officers assistant 19681970 through assistant treasurer 19701972 and assistant Vice President 19721975 to Vice President in 1975

Warner was recently selected for a coveted sixyear term on the Yale Corporation Yale Universitys governing body

Analysts say that Mr Warner was a key figure throughout the 1980s and 1990s in the transformation of JP Morgan from a commercial bank to an investment banking firm For example JP Morgan was the first commercial bank since the 1930s to be granted the power to underwrite debt and equity securities Under Warner the firm ended lifelong job security as a result of a 1998 restructuring One of his biggest cultural marks on JP Morgan was the creation of the House Arrest group a dozen or so senior executives who met monthly to discuss management issues


In 1998 Warner was an invited Gordon Grand Fellow lecturer at Yale University and in 2001 he was awarded the Leadership Award from The Hill School As an alumnus of The Hill School Warner had proven himself to be an exemplary leader and true role model for students in his vocation

The Current song
The Current is a song by Blue Man Group released as the first single from their 2003 concept album The Complex The song features the guest vocals of Gavin Rossdale of Bush and was featured in the film 

The song deals with urban and occupational isolation the two key themes from the album The isolation theme is furthered by the setting which takes place in the underground portion of the urban complexthe location of the phone lines electrical wires and Internet connections According to the Blue Man Group themselves We wanted to capture the modern paradox of having access to millions of people through electric current but still being cut off from any real human contact

The song might then be assumed to be about how technology is moving the world forward whilst it moves people backwards

Another promo CD was released in a cardboard slide case

I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day
I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day is a Christmas carol based on the 1863 poem Christmas Bells by American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow The song tells of the narrators despair upon hearing Christmas bells that hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth good will to men The carol concludes with the bells carrying renewed hope for peace among men

In 1861 two years before writing this poem Longfellows personal peace was shaken when his second wife of 18 years to whom he was very devoted was tragically burned in a fire
Then in 1863 during the American Civil War Longfellows oldest son Charles Appleton Longfellow joined the Union cause as a soldier without his fathers blessing Longfellow was informed by a letter dated March 14 1863 after Charles had left I have tried hard to resist the temptation of going without your leave but I cannot any longer he wrote I feel it to be my first duty to do what I can for my country and I would willingly lay down my life for it if it would be of any good Charles soon got an appointment as a lieutenant but in November he was severely wounded in the Battle of New Hope Church in Virginia during the Mine Run Campaign Charles eventually recovered but his time as a soldier was finished

Longfellow first wrote the poem on Christmas Day in 1863 Christmas Bells was first published in February 1865 in Our Young Folks a juvenile magazine published by Ticknor and Fields References to the Civil War are prevalent in some of the verses that are not commonly sung

The following are the original words of Longfellows poem

poem
I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play 
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

And thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom 
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Till ringing singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Then from each black accursed mouth
The cannon thundered in the South 
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

It was as if an earthquake rent
The hearthstones of a continent
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said 
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doth He sleep 
With peace on earth goodwill to men
poem

It was not until 1872 that the poem is known to have been set to music The English organist John Baptiste Calkin used the poem in a processional accompanied with a melody he previously used as early as 1848 The Calkin version of the carol was long the standard Less commonly the poem has also been set to Joseph Mainzers composition Mainzer 1845 In 2011 Jack Gibbons the British pianist and composer set Longfellows poem to music in his role as artistinresidence at Davis  Elkins College and the first performance was given by the Davis  Elkins College choir on December 4 2011 Since at least the middle of the 20th century the poem has been set to other musical arrangements

In 1956 Bing Crosbys version recorded on October 3 1956 and released as a single that reached No 55 in the Music Vendor survey The record was praised by both Billboard and Variety Bing Crosbys workover of I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day looks like a big one for the 56 Yule and a hit potential of enduring value At deadline time not many of this years Christmas issues had shown much action This new Crosby record however was off to a promising start As fast as it is catching on early in the month it is easy to project the impressive volume it will rack up the last half of December

In chapter five of his 1962 novel Something Wicked This Way Comes Ray Bradbury describes this carol as immensely moving overwhelming no matter what day or what month it was sung The carol provides an ironic contrast to the evil that Mr Darks carnival is about to bring to Green Town Illinois where the story takes place In the 1983 film adaptation of the novel Mr Dark Jonathan Pryce and Charles Halloway Jason Robards both quote passages from the carol when they meet in the towns library though Dark ominously states that its a thousand years to Christmas

In 2008 the contemporary Christian music group Casting Crowns scored their eighth No 1 Christian hit with I Heard the Bells from their album Peace on Earth The song is not an exact replica of the original poem or carol but an interpolation of verses 1 6 7 and 3 in that order interposed with a new chorus However the new version has reintroduced the original poem to a modern listeners

FamaMacBeth regression
The FamaMacBeth regression is a method used to estimate parameters for asset pricing models such as the Capital asset pricing model CAPM The method estimates the betas and risk premia for any risk factors that are expected to determine asset prices The method works with multiple assets across time panel data The parameters are estimated in two steps


Eugene F Fama and James D MacBeth 1973 demonstrated that the residuals of riskreturn regressions and the observed fair game properties of the coefficients are consistent with an efficient capital market quotes in the original

Note that Fama MacBeth regressions provide standard errors corrected only for crosssectional correlation The standard errors from this method do not correct for timeseries autocorrelation This is usually not a problem for stock trading since stocks have weak timeseries autocorrelation in daily and weekly holding periods but autocorrelation is stronger over long horizons This means Fama MacBeth regressions may be inappropriate to use in many corporate finance settings where project holding periods tend to be long For alternative methods of correcting standard errors for time series and crosssectional correlation in the error term look into double clustering by firm and year

At 63 and 190 pounds Siegfried was considered a prototype guard for the NBA at that time The Cincinnati Royals drafted him with their first pick in 1961 to pair with Oscar Robertson in their backcourt Siegfried would not play in Cincinnati because of Ohio States loss to Cincinnatis Bearcats that year Instead he joined the Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League The team owned by future Yankee boss George Steinbrenner and coached by John McLendon and Bill Sharman won that pro leagues 196162 title Dick Barnett and Connie Dierking were among that teams stars The highly drafted Siegfried was just a reserve

When the ABL folded the next year the St Louis Hawks acquired his rights but then surprisingly cut him Siegfried considered retirement becoming a high school coach and teacher before former college teammate Havlicek convinced coach Red Auerbach to try him out for the Boston Celtics Slowly regaining his confidence Siegfried proved to be a key pickup He eventually became a starter next to Havlicek or Sam Jones in the backcourt His defense and free throw shooting were key to NBA title wins for Boston in 1968 and 1969 Boston announcer Johnny Most often noted his tenacious defense calling Ziggys in his shirt tonight to describe Siegfried on many nights

Siegfried played his first seven professional seasons with the Boston Celtics earning five championship rings during that time He led the NBA in free throw percentage in both the 196566 and 196869 seasons

Siegfried spent the last season of his career with the Rockets and Hawks organizations

Following his NBA career Siegfried counseled prisoners at the Mansfield Correctional Institution in Ohio and did motivational speakingHe also served briefly as the Executive Director of the Central Ohio Chapter of The Associated Builders  Contractors ABC He died of a heart attack on October 14 2010

Behavioural change theories
Behavioural change theories are attempts to explain why behaviours change These theories cite environmental personal and behavioural characteristics as the major factors in behavioural determination In recent years there has been increased interest in the application of these theories in the areas of health education criminology energy and international development with the hope that understanding behavioural change will improve the services offered in these areas Some scholars have recently introduced a distinction between models of behavior and theories of change Whereas models of behavior are more diagnostic and geared towards understanding the psychological factors that explain or predict a specific behavior theories of change are more processoriented and generally aimed at changing a given behavior Thus from this perspective understanding and changing behavior are two separate but complementary lines of scientific investigation

Each behavioural change theory or model focuses on different factors in attempting to explain behaviour change Of the many that exist the most prevalent are learning theories social cognitive theory theories of reasoned action and planned behaviour transtheoretical model of behavior change the health action process approach and the BJ Fogg model of behavior change Research has also been conducted regarding specific elements of these theories especially elements like selfefficacy that are common to several of the theories

Selfefficacy is an individuals impression of their own ability to perform a demanding or challenging task such as facing an exam or undergoing surgery This impression is based upon factors like the individuals prior success in the task or in related tasks the individuals physiological state and outside sources of persuasion Selfefficacy is thought to be predictive of the amount of effort an individual will expend in initiating and maintaining a behavioural change so although selfefficacy is not a behavioural change theory per se it is an important element of many of the theories including the health belief model the theory of planned behaviour and the health action process approach

From behaviourists such as B F Skinner come the learning theories which state that complex behaviour is learned gradually through the modification of simpler behaviours Imitation and reinforcement play important roles in these theories which state that individuals learn by duplicating behaviours they observe in others and that rewards are essential to ensuring the repetition of desirable behaviour As each simple behaviour is established through imitation and subsequent reinforcement the complex behaviour develops When verbal behaviour is established the organism can learn through rulegoverned behaviour and thus not all action needs to be contingency shaped

According to the social learning theory more recently expanded as social cognitive theory behavioural change is determined by environmental personal and behavioural elements Each factor affects each of the others For example in congruence with the principles of selfefficacy an individuals thoughts affect their behaviour and an individuals characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment Likewise an individuals environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the persons behavior and an individuals behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels Social learning theory focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors which are hypothesised to determine behavioral change

The theory of reasoned action assumes that individuals consider a behaviours consequences before performing the particular behaviour As a result intention is an important factor in determining behaviour and behavioural change According to Icek Ajzen intentions develop from an individuals perception of a behaviour as positive or negative together with the individuals impression of the way their society perceives the same behaviour Thus personal attitude and social pressure shape intention which is essential to performance of a behaviour and consequently behavioural change

In 1985 Ajzen expanded upon the theory of reasoned action formulating the theory of planned behaviour which also emphasises the role of intention in behaviour performance but is intended to cover cases in which a person is not in control of all factors affecting the actual performance of a behaviour As a result the new theory states that the incidence of actual behaviour performance is proportional to the amount of control an individual possesses over the behaviour and the strength of the individuals intention in performing the behaviour In his article Further hypothesises that selfefficacy is important in determining the strength of the individuals intention to perform a behaviour In 2010 Fishbein and Ajzen introduced the reasoned action approach the successor of the theory of planned behaviour

According to the transtheoretical model of behavior change also known as the stages of change model states that there are five stages towards behavior change The five stages between which individuals may transition before achieving complete change are precontemplation contemplation preparation for action action and maintenance At the precontemplation stage an individual may or may not be aware of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior From precontemplation to contemplation the individual begins thinking about changing a certain behavior During preparation the individual begins his plans for change and during the action stage the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it is very easy for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then fall back into earlier stages Factors that contribute to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes andor personal issues a person is dealing with

The health action process approach HAPA is designed as a sequence of two continuous selfregulatory processes a goalsetting phase motivation and a goalpursuit phase volition The second phase is subdivided into a preaction phase and an action phase Motivational selfefficacy outcomeexpectancies and risk perceptions are assumed to be predictors of intentions This is the motivational phase of the model The predictive effect of motivational selfefficacy on behaviour is assumed to be mediated by recovery selfefficacy and the effects of intentions are assumed to be mediated by planning The latter processes refer to the volitional phase of the model

The Fogg Behavior Model FBM is a design behavior change model introduced by BJ Fogg This model posits that behavior is composed of three different factors motivation ability and triggers Under the FBM for any person user to succeed at behavior change needs to be motivated have the ability to perform the behavior and needs a trigger to perform this behavior The next are the definitions of each of the elements of the BFM

BJ Fogg does not provide a definition of motivation but instead defines different motivators

This factor refers to the self efficacy perception at performing a target behavior Although low ability is undesirable it may be unavoidable We are fundamentally lazy according to BJ Fogg In such case behavior change is approached not through learning but instead by promoting target behaviors for which the user has a high ability Additionally BJ Fogg list several elements or dimensions that characterize high ability or simplicity of performing a behavior 

Triggers are reminders that may be explicit or implicit about the performance of a behavior Examples of triggers can be alarms text messages or advertisement triggers are usually perceptual in nature but may also be intrinsic One of the most important aspects of a trigger is timing as only certain times are best for triggering certain behaviors As an example if a person is trying to go to the gym everyday but only remembers about packing clothing once out of the house it is less likely that this person will head back home and pack In contrast if an alarm sounds right before leaving the house reminding about packing clothing this will take considerably less effort Although the original article does not have any references for the reasoning or theories behind the model some of its elements can be traced to social psychology theories eg the motivation and ability factors and its success or failure are related to Selfefficacy

Behavioural change theories can be used as guides in developing effective teaching methods Since the goal of much education is behavioural change the understanding of behaviour afforded by behavioural change theories provides insight into the formulation of effective teaching methods that tap into the mechanisms of behavioural change In an era when education programs strive to reach large audiences with varying socioeconomic statuses the designers of such programs increasingly strive to understand the reasons behind behavioural change in order to understand universal characteristics that may be crucial to program design

In fact some of the theories like the social learning theory and theory of planned behaviour were developed as attempts to improve health education Because these theories address the interaction between individuals and their environments they can provide insight into the effectiveness of education programs given a specific set of predetermined conditions like the social context in which a program will be initiated Although health education is still the area in which behavioural change theories are most often applied theories like the stages of change model have begun to be applied in other areas like employee training and developing systems of higher education

Empirical studies in criminology support behavioural change theories At the same time the general theories of behavioural change suggest possible explanations to criminal behaviour and methods of correcting deviant behaviour Since deviant behaviour correction entails behavioural change understanding of behavioural change can facilitate the adoption of effective correctional methods in policymaking For example the understanding that deviant behaviour like stealing may be learned behaviour resulting from reinforcers like hunger satisfaction that are unrelated to criminal behaviour can aid the development of social controls that address this underlying issue rather than merely the resultant behaviour

Specific theories that have been applied to criminology include the social learning and differential association theories Social learning theorys element of interaction between an individual and their environment explains the development of deviant behaviour as a function of an individuals exposure to a certain behaviour and their acquaintances who can reinforce either socially acceptable or socially unacceptable behaviour Differential association theory originally formulated by Edwin Sutherland is a popular related theoretical explanation of criminal behaviour that applies learning theory concepts and asserts that deviant behaviour is learned behaviour

Recent years have seen an increased interest in energy consumption reduction based on behavioural change be it for reasons of climate change mitigation or energy security The application of behavioural change theories in the field of energy consumption behaviour yields interesting insights For example it supports criticism of a too narrow focus on individual behaviour and a broadening to include social interaction lifestyles norms and values as well as technologies and policiesall enabling or constraining behavioural change

Besides the models and theories of behavior change there are methods for promoting behavior change Among them one of the most widely used is Tailoring or personalization

Tailoring refers to methods for personalizing communications intended to generate higher behavior change than non personalized ones There are two main claims for why tailoring works Tailoring may improve preconditions for message processing and tailoring may improve impact by altering starting behavioral determinants of goal outcomes The different message processing mechanisms can be summarized into Attention Effortful processing Emotional processing and selfreference 
Behavioral determinants of goal outcomes are the different psychological and social constructs that have a direct influence on behavior The three most used mediators in tailoring are attitude perception of performance and self efficacy Although results are largely positive they are not consistent and more research on the elements that make tailoring work is necessary

Behavioural change theories are not universally accepted Criticisms include the theories emphases on individual behaviour and a general disregard for the influence of environmental factors on behaviour In addition as some theories were formulated as guides to understanding behaviour while others were designed as frameworks for behavioural interventions the theories purposes are not consistent Such criticism illuminates the strengths and weaknesses of the theories showing that there is room for further research into behavioural change theories

Paint Branch High School
Paint Branch High School is a high school located in the Fairland censusdesignated place an unincorporated section of Montgomery County Maryland it has a Burtonsville postal address

It is named after the Paint Branch creek The school was founded in 1969 and is part of the Montgomery County Public Schools System The school lies on Old Columbia Pike between Briggs Chaney and Greencastle Road

Paint Branch once a rural high school now deep in the heart of suburban sprawl is a member of the Northeast Consortium schools in Montgomery County As a member of the Consortium the schools signature program focuses on Science and Media education The panther is the schools mascot and the school song is Hail to the Panthers which is sung to the tune of Hail to the Redskins The schools colors are burgundy and gold also the same as the Washington Redskins

Paint Branch competes in the 4A North division in the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association MPSSAA The Panthers have fielded a total of 22 state championship athletic teams including Girls Basketball 1979 1980 2001 2008 Baseball 1976 1979 1990 1991 Boys Basketball 1977 2000 Wrestling 1978 2001 Boys CrossCountry 1973 1974 Boys Track and Field Indoor 2003 2019 Outdoor 2003 Girls Track and Field Indoor 2009 Outdoor 1989 Field Hockey 2009 Softball 1987 and Football 1975



A new building is now established in the location that the woods next to the football field once occupied As the only school at that time without a new building Paint Branch High School was guaranteed a new building when it was asked to enter the Northeast Consortium back in 1998 The new building was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2010 but budget shortfalls pushed that date until April 2012 resulting in the class of 2013 being the first class to graduate from the new building Hess Construction Co was awarded the contract to build the new school Hess Construction Co is also the builder of the Kenmore Middle School in Arlington County Virginia Staff moved into the new building June 18 2012

The old Paint Branch building originally scheduled to be torn down in the summer of 2012 was torn down in October 2012 Sports fields were completed by the 20132014 school year

Efunction
In mathematics Efunctions are a type of power series that satisfy particular arithmetic conditions on the coefficients They are of interest in transcendental number theory and are more special than Gfunctions

A function fx is called of type E or an Efunction if the power series

satisfies the following three conditions

where the left hand side represents the maximum of the absolute values of all the algebraic conjugates of c

The second condition implies that f is an entire function of x

Efunctions were first studied by Siegel in 1929 He found a method to show that the values taken by certain Efunctions were algebraically independentThis was a result which established the algebraic independence of classes of numbers rather than just linear independence Since then these functions have proved somewhat useful in number theory and in particular they have application in transcendence proofs and differential equations

Perhaps the main result connected to Efunctions is the SiegelShidlovsky theorem also known as the Shidlovsky and Shidlovskii theorem named after Carl Ludwig Siegel and Andrei Borisovich Shidlovskii

Suppose that we are given n Efunctions ExEx that satisfy a system of homogeneous linear differential equations
where the f are rational functions of x and the coefficients of each E and f are elements of an algebraic number field K Then the theorem states that if ExEx are algebraically independent over Kx then for any nonzero algebraic number  that is not a pole of any of the f the numbers EE are algebraically independent

Space Empires V
Space Empires V SEV is a 4X turn based strategy game that was released in 2006 It was developed by Malfador Machinations and published by Strategy First The game retains many races and technologies from its predecessor Space Empires IV SEIV

While Space Empires V retains much of its predecessors gameplay there are several key differences It is the first Space Empires game to use threedimensional graphics and as such the user interface has been heavily redesigned New to the series is a 3D realtime combat engine and the player can now control ground combat in addition to the usual space battles The empirebuilding aspects of the game borrows as much from the third instalment as it does from the fourth with research and intelligence being assigned as a percentage of available points as opposed to the queue system used for construction

Virtually all of the stock races with the exception of the Sithrak are updated versions of SEIV races Custom race creation is basically the same as in the previous games with two notable changes  you must now select a government type in addition to a social paradigm and the game master may grant players a set number of research points to improve starting technology As of now there are comparatively few playercreated shipsets arguably a consequence of the switch to 3D graphics

The game received mixed reviews Several have complained that the game is overcomplex and overloads the player with options especially while setting up a new game and that it may not be suitable for players who are new to 4X games One huge bug in the game that frustrated many players initially was the AIs design routine which in early releases would always build only one ship types based on the largest hull available For example if the AI had battleship technology it would build only battleships until a bigger hull size was available

Accelerated Christian Education
Accelerated Christian Education is an American company which produces the Accelerated Christian Education ACE styled by the company as ACE school curriculum structured around a literal interpretation of the Bible and which teaches other academic subjects from a Protestant fundamentalist or conservative Evangelical standpoint Founded in 1970 by Donald and Esther Howard ACEs website states it is used in over 6000 schools in 145 countries ACE has been criticized for its content heavy reliance on the use of rote recall as a learning tool and for the educational outcomes of pupils on leaving the Accelerated Christian Education system both in the US and the United Kingdom

Accelerated Christian Education was founded in 1970 by Drs Donald and Esther Howard They set about developing a biblically literalist educational curriculum with Donald Howard traveling to promote ACE schools around the world as a new form of educational mission

The first school which used the ACE program opened in Garland Texas and started with 45 students By 1980 there were over 3000 Christian schools in the United States associated with ACE reaching 8000 during the 1980s

In 1996 ACE opened a threestory facility in Lewisville Texas to handle its growing operations Esther Howard took over control of ACE the following year She remains as ACEs President and Duane Howard one of the couples sons currently serves as Vice President In 2007 ACE moved its corporate offices to Madison Tennessee eventually moving to Hendersonville Tennessee in 2014 The Lewisville facility remains as ACEs distribution center

According to the curriculum section on its website ACEs core curriculum is an individualized Biblicallybased characterbuilding curriculum package and is based on a series of workbooks called PACEs Packets of Accelerated Christian Education At the beginning of each PACE is an overview a scripture to memorize a character trait to strive toward and information on what if any supplies the student will need Each subject has 12 PACEs per grade level The basic subjects of ACE are math yellow English red Literature  Creative Writing light red Word BuildingEtymology purple science blue social studies green Old and New Testament orange Students in the Philippines also study Filipino pink and Araling Panlipunan brown
A new student is given a placement test and the results place the student at appropriate levels by subject Students are required to set daily goals for work completion and are generally expected to finish a given PACE within two to three weeks depending on the school Students are given reviews at certain points in a PACE called checkups and a test at its culmination The passing score for the test can be from 80 to 90 also depending on the corresponding school Students who fail must take what measures the school provides to pass the PACE

Schools using the curriculum are not allowed to describe themselves as ACE schools or use the ACE logo although schools are expected to sign an agreement and follow the ACE Procedures Manual and Administration Manual

The program can be used by homeschooling families and private establishments ACE provides instruction and structure for operating a Christian school ACEs website advises that schools are not required to use the entire curriculum and may augment it with other resources although this incurs a financial penalty as the school loses its discount

The company also sells home schooling and distance learning curriculum materials through its Lighthouse Christian Academy LCA

ACE provides annual oneday training sessions called Christian Educators Conventions CEC for administrators supervisors and monitors These are provided in locations around the United States The sessions focus on understanding and properly implementing the ACE program For Learning Center Supervisors a fourday workshop is provided annually The workshop is organized like an ACE classroom allowing the supervisor to experience the ACE system as a student and learn how to implement the system

Schools that use the ACE curriculum may participate in the Regional Student Conventions and the topplaced participants are able to proceed to the International Student Convention This convention is usually held at a university campus such as Indiana University in Bloomington 1990 the University of North Texas in Denton 1991 Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff 1993 and Purdue University in Indiana 1994 International Student Conventions have been held at Western Kentucky University 2010 with about 2500 students James Madison University 2011 3000 attending New Mexico State University 2015 2500 participants and Indiana University of Pennsylvania 2017 2200 students The All Africa Student Convention takes place in South Africa once a year at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein South Africa The All Africa Student Convention is not organized or hosted by ACE United States but by Accelerated Christian Education South Africa which is a separate organization providing the ACE curriculum to African schools

The conventions also offer Events of the Heart which allow students with mental and physical disabilities to participate When the conventions first started a parade in the hosting city would accompany a convention In 1981 over 3000 students and sponsors marched in New York City to celebrate the opening of the convention at Rutgers University Student conventions offer speakers past speakers have included David Gibbs from the Christian Law Association Ben Jordan and William Murray

The curriculums emphasis on rote recall has been criticized by educational researchers David Berliner described the teaching methods as lowlevel cognitive tasks that emphasize simple association and recall activities as is typical of instruction from workbooks the materials make heavy use of behavioral objectives programmed learning and rewards D Flemming and T Hunt in a 1987 article in the education journal Phi Delta Kappa analyzed the ACE curriculum concluding that If parents want their children to obtain a very limited and sometimes inaccurate view of the world one that ignores thinking above the level of rote recall then the ACE materials do the job very well The world of the ACE materials is quite a different one from that of scholarship and critical thinking

The ACE curriculum included controversial content in relation to race Social Studies World History PACE 108 stated

Although apartheid appears to allow the unfair treatment of blacks the system has worked well in South Africa  Although white businessmen and developers are guilty of some unfair treatment of blacks they turned South Africa into a modern industrialized nation which the poor uneducated blacks couldnt have accomplished in several more decades If more blacks were suddenly given control of the nation its economy and business as Mandela wished they could have destroyed what they have waited and worked so hard for

ACE Social studies PACE also attempts to play down the role of slavery in the American Civil War stating that God created the war to punish people for religious apostasy

In addition the curriculum has been criticized for its depiction of racially segregated churches and schools

Science is presented in the ACE curriculum through the framework of Young Earth Creationism YEC For example in Biology 1099 the existence of the Loch Ness monster is presented as a fact as a plesiosaur and used as a socalled proof against the theory of evolution Textbooks published in Europe removed the Loch Ness monster reference in July 2013 however children are still only taught creationism as an explanation for the origin of life on earth

Textbooks used in the curriculum assert that abortion is wrong evolution is false and homosexuality is a choice They teach that wives must be subservient to their husbands womens liberation leads to child neglect and that one can avoid AIDS by being abstinent until marriage

The ACE curriculum in Science 1096 asserts that solar fusion is a myth describing it as an invention of evolution scientists

As of January 2017 there are 26 schools using the ACE curriculum registered in the United Kingdom In October 2016 ten schools graded by British parliamentary education inspectors OFSTED were revisited following concerns of mistreatment raised in British press nine of which were subsequently regraded as inadequate or requires improvement by the watchdog In 2018 a further ACE school in London was rated inadequate for failing to teach adequate science and for not teaching children to develop the skills to collect and evaluate scientific evidence

In 2017 research into the International Certificate of Christian Education the schoolleaving qualification provided by ACE in the UK claimed that it failed to prepare students for university level education Professor Michael Reiss of University of London stated My particular problem with ACE is the awful nature of the curriculum they provide to their students The study by Scaramanga and Reiss states that the curriculum fails students as it is heavily based around memorizing information rather than analyzing and understanding it

Having researched comparative performance on the American College Test between public school students from one school and ACE students from another private school in the same geographic area one college student wrote in her thesis in 2005 that a significant difference was found between the public school graduates scores and the ACE graduates scores in all areas of the ACT English Math Reading and Composite Score except the area of Science Reasoning Overall the ACT scores of the ACE graduates were consistently lower than those of the public school students The author also noted that the current study did not account for variables such as socioeconomic status ethnicity gender or parents level of education These variables may impact ACT scores and therefore need to be considered in future research nor was demographic information of the public school used for comparison Furthermore the sample size of graduates from ACE was disproportionately small in this analysis

As of 2019 applicants who completed their Grade 12 or equivalent at the ACE Accelerated Christian Education School of Tomorrow may no longer be accepted to study at the University of South Africa

Ross was the son of Ross II who pitched for the 1951 Chicago White Sox and his wife Judy Robinson Grimsley Ross II a World War II veteran had a long minorleague playing career

The younger Ross Grimsley was a 1969 graduate of Frayser High School in Memphis Tennessee where he was an outstanding basketball and baseball player He attended Jackson State Community College in Jackson Tennessee He was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round 17th pick of the 1969 amateur draft January Secondary

He made his major league debut for the Reds at age 21 on May 16 1971 in a 93 loss to the Expos at Riverfront Stadium He started and took the loss pitched 12 innings and gave up three earned runs The first major league hitter he faced was Ron Hunt In 26 starts that year he posted a record of 107 with a 357 ERA

He followed up with an even better season in 1972 going 148 with a 305 ERA for the National League champion Reds He also had s strong World Series going 21 in four games three in relief with a 257 ERA as the Reds fell to the Oakland Athletics in seven games In 1973 he was 1310 with a 323 ERA as the Reds won the NL West division

Grimsley played for a Reds team that was notorious for conservative rules that governed the appearance and decorum of its players on and off the field Flaunting the team rules with his long hair he ran afoul of manager Sparky Anderson who requested after the 1973 season that Grimsley be traded He along with Wally Williams was sent to the Baltimore Orioles for Merv Rettenmund Junior Kennedy and Bill Wood two months later on December 4

The deal paid off for the Orioles in 1974 as Grimsley went 1813 with 17 complete games in a careerhigh 39 starts as the Orioles were American League East division champions In 1975 and 1976 his totals were down with records of 1013 with a 407 ERA and 87 with a 395 ERA In 1977 he was 1410 with a 396 ERA 

He cashed in on his free agent status by signing a sixyear 11 million contract with the Montreal Expos on December 6 1977 Ironically the Orioles had attempted to trade him to the Expos for Barry Foote prior to the 1977 season Grimsley rewarded the Expos with his best year in 1978 He was named to the 1978 National League AllStar team and finished seventh in voting for the 1978 National League Cy Young Award posting a record of 2011 19 complete games three shutouts 263 innings pitched and a 305 ERA However in 1979 he fell to a record of 109 with a 535 ERA In 1980 he was only 26 with a 631 ERA for the Expos and on July 11 he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for whom he went 45 with a 675 ERA

Grimsley was one of the more colorful players of the 1970s With the Reds he was called into manager Sparky Andersons office and told to stop corresponding with a witch who had been sending him good luck charms Despite being a premier starting pitcher for the Reds he was traded to the Orioles for Merv Rettenmund a parttime outfielder after the 1973 season largely in part for his constant resistance to the Reds organizations conservative grooming rules With the Orioles in 1974 he sported a huge mop of curly hair and prominent moustache

In an incident on September 16 at Fenway Park Grimsley warming up in the Orioles bullpen responded to Boston fans heckling by throwing into the right field bleachers The ball passed through the protective netting injuring a Boston fan The fan later successfully sued Grimsley and the Orioles in Manning v Grimsley a case cited in law casebooks to highlight the scope of employment law as it relates to agency He was accused by Yankees manager Billy Martin in 1977 of throwing spitball pitches using Vaseline hidden in his hair which was usually somewhat greasy in appearance anyway due to Grimsleys penchant for not showering during winning streaks In addition to his nickname Scuz for his liberal grooming habits he was also called Crazy Eyes and known to wear turquoise contact lenses

After his playing career ended he was a minor league instructor for the Orioles Atlanta Braves Seattle Mariners and Philadelphia Phillies

Since 1999 Grimsley has been a minorleague pitching coach for the San Francisco Giants He is currently the pitching coach for the AA Richmond Flying Squirrels formerly the Connecticut Defenders

He and his wife live outside of Baltimore

Mount Baker Tunnel
The Mount Baker Tunnel or Mount Baker Ridge Tunnel carries Interstate 90 under the Mount Baker neighborhood of Seattle Washington It is actually a group of three tunnels that carry eight lanes of freeway traffic plus a separate path for bicycles and pedestrians The two originals are twin tunnel bores completed in 1940 and rehabilitated in 1993 The newest tunnel was built north of the original tunnels and opened in June 1989 The tunnel has a doubledecked roadway with the bicyclepedestrian path above the traffic lanes

The tunnel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 ID 82004243 The east portals of the tunnel with murals titled  designed by artist James FitzGerald along with the Lacey V Murrow Bridge are an official City of Seattle landmark

The official length is  though the perceived length while driving is closer to because of a cutandcover lid between the western portal and the beginning of the actual tunnel under the Mount Baker ridge The former west portal now located well inside the tunnel is no longer discernible and its two arch structures were removed during 19891993 modification work The eastern end of the tunnel links to the Lacey V Murrow Memorial Bridge and the Homer M Hadley Memorial Bridge collectively the I90 floating bridge on Lake Washington to Mercer Island

At in diameter it is the worlds largest diameter soft earth tunnel having been bored through clay

When completed in 1940 the twin tunnels connected the I90 floating bridge on Lake Washington and Rainier Avenue South in Seattle The bridge and tunnels were part of US Highway 10 which used surface streets between the tunnels and downtown Seattle US 10 was a fourlane undivided highway Each tunnel held two traffic lanes The north tunnel normally carried two westbound lanes The south tunnel normally carried two eastbound lanes In the 1960s a laneuse signal system was added to improve peak commute traffic During peak commute times the signals were used to make the center two lanes reversible In the mornings three lanes flowed west and one lane flowed east In the evenings three lanes flowed east and one lane flowed west During morning and evening commutes one tunnel carried two lanes of traffic in the same direction while the other tunnel carried opposing traffic separated only by dashed yellow lines

The highway would later become part of Interstate 90 be expanded and upgraded to a controlledaccess freeway The freeway expansion and upgrade was completed in 1993

The expansion included construction of a new parallel tunnel with a larger diameter located north of the original tunnel Construction began in 1983 When the overall I90 project was completed in 1993 the twin 1940 tunnels would be connected to the southern I90 floating bridge the Lacey V Murrow Memorial Bridge and carry eastbound traffic only while the 1989 tunnel would be connected to the northern floating bridge the thennew Homer M Hadley Memorial Bridge and be westboundonly for general traffic

The original pair of tunnels were each in diameter while the new tunnel was in diameter The new tunnel was built to carry traffic on three levels two lanes for buses and carpools on the bottom level three lanes of general traffic on the middle level and cyclists and pedestrians on the top level Excavation was completed in 1986 and the new tunnel opened to traffic in June 1989 Although designed to carry only westbound traffic the new tunnel and thennew Homer Hadley Memorial Bridge temporarily carried all traffic  in both directions  when opened in 1989 while work continued on modifying the old Mercer Island Bridge where it connected to the 1940 Murrow Bridge and on rehabilitation of the latter 

The new tunnel opened to westbound traffic on June 4 1989 and to eastbound traffic on June 23 On the latter date the old tunnel and floating bridge closed to all traffic for renovation that was originally expected to take three years When a long section of the Murrow Bridge sank during a storm in 1990 the reopening was delayed by about one year until 1993
With the reopening of the Murrow Bridge in 1993 the older Mount Baker Ridge tunnel also reopened with all of its lanes now eastboundonly Instead of carrying two traffic lanes in each tunnel the reconfigured lanes in the twin 1940 tunnels comprised two lanes of eastbound traffic in the northern tunnel and one lane of eastbound traffic in the southern tunnel and with pedestrians no longer permitted because of the exclusive pedestrian and bicycle facilities now provided in the parallel new tunnel A second eastbound lane was later reinstated in the northern tunnel The reversible lanes in the older tunnels had been separated only by painted lines on the roadway surface but the reversible lanes on the rebuilt and expanded freeway which use only the newer 1989 tunnel are separated by concrete barriers to improve safety 

The I90 expansion project also effectively more than doubled the length of the Mt Baker Tunnel The west portal of the twin 1940 tunnels which had been located near 29th Avenue South was removed and a concrete lid was built over the freeway covering the section between the old west portal and west end of the lid just west of 23rd Avenue South However officially the lid is not considered to be part of the tunnel and a 1993 Historic American Engineering Record survey stated that the lengths of the two 1940 tunnels remain each Inside the older tunnels which had been archshaped the ceiling and walls were made square matching the shape of the lidded section Equipment to boost radio reception was added

Upon completion of the Interstate 90 expansion program in the 1990s the freeway capacity increased to three generalpurpose lanes in each direction and two reversible HOV lanes Eastbound traffic uses the original tunnels Westbound traffic uses the upper deck of the northern new tunnel A twolane reversible roadway uses the lower deck The reversible roadway served as express lanes for transit buses and carpools 2 people during peak commute periods until 2017 The express lanes flowed westbound on weekday mornings and eastbound on weekday afternoons and evenings On weekends the express lanes were open traffic direction was variable depending on anticipated traffic volumes When the express lanes were open to eastbound traffic singleoccupant vehicles headed to Mercer Island are allowed to use the lanes per an interlocal agreement signed in 1976

Above the westbound traffic is the I90 Trail tunnel At  it is the longest nonadapted trail tunnel in the world On the western half the trail emerges onto the lid and uses trails in Lid Park

In 2017 the Washington State Department of Transportation added a pair of highoccupancy vehicle lanes HOV lanes to Interstate 90 from Seattle to Bellevue replacing the reversible express lanes The express lanes were closed in June 2017 for the construction of the East Link light rail project which will extend Link light rail service from Seattle to Bellevue and Redmond in 2023 On Mercer Island WSDOT and Sound Transit are building direct access ramps to allow buses and HOVs to exit and enter I90 from the HOV lanes

McCloy received a Meritorious Unit Commendation MUC for unsurpassed ASW accomplishments from 8 June to 22 December 1982 during this deployment She also received the Sixth Fleet Hook Em Award and was designated as the Best ASW Ship in the Atlantic Fleet during the period 1 October 1980 to 31 March 1982 by Commander Naval Surface Force US Atlantic Fleet Following this highly successful Med deployment McCloy again conducted Special ASW Operations in the Western Atlantic Bermuda Box environment

On 31 October 1983 McCloy snagged the  a Soviet Victor IIIclass nuclearpowered attack submarine with her towed array causing damage to the submarines propeller The submarine was towed to Cienfuegos Cuba for repairs by a Soviet salvage ship beginning on 5 November 1983

In the late 1980s McCloy was involved in drug interdiction operations in the Caribbean Sea with a United States Coast Guard law enforcement detachment on board She was involved in several large drug busts including a 50ton marijuana seizure from the vessel Sea Wanderer in November 1986

On 27 April 1988 McCloy assisted submarine rescue vessel and salvage ship in conducting rescue operations following a fire on submarine 

McCloy was decommissioned on 14 December 1990 stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 December 1990 and transferred to Mexico on 1 October 1993 along with her sister ship  In the Mexican Navy McCloy was renamed ARM Nicols Bravo E40 for Nicols Bravo a Mexican politician and soldier As of June 2010 Nicols Bravo was still in service with the Mexican Navy

USS Richard L Page
USS Richard L Page FFG5 was a Brooke class frigate in the United States Navy

Richard L Page was laid down on 4 January 1965 by the Bath Iron Works Bath Maine She was launched on 4 April 1966 sponsored by Miss Edmonia Lee Whittle and Mrs Nannie Page Trinker granddaughters of the ships namesake Brigadier General Richard L Page and commissioned as a guided missile destroyer escort at Boston Massachusetts on 5 August 1967 with the hull number DEG5 Commander Milton J Schultz Jr USN in command

In midOctober 1967 Richard L Page moved from Boston to her homeport of Naval Station Newport Rhode Island then sailed south for shakedown exercises in the Caribbean On 21 December 1967 she returned to Newport and after postshakedown availability began operations with Escort Squadron SIX CORTRON 6 Into 1968 she operated in the western Atlantic and in the fall she deployed to the Mediterranean for duty with the 6th Fleet On that duty until 10 February 1969 she returned to Newport on 18 February and in March 1969 resumed operations with the 2nd Fleet On 1 July 1969 she relieved as flagship of Destroyer Division ONE TWODESRON 12 then conducted exercises in the Caribbean

Richard L Page spent all of 1971 and the first eight months of 1972 in port at Newport and in operations along the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean In midAugust 1972 she steamed out of Newport bound for an extended deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean

From 1973 to 1975 she was forward deployed to Athens Greece and on 30 June 1975 she was reclassified as a guided missile frigate with the new hull number of FFG5 Returning from Europe Richard L Page underwent a yearlong modernization overhaul returning to the Atlantic Fleet and a new homeport of Naval Station Norfolk Virginia in 1976 Over the next four years she repeatedly deployed to the Mediterranean Middle East the eastern coast of Africa and Northern Europe interspersed with brief periods in her stateside homeport of Norfolk

During this same four year period in 1979 Richard L Page was the recipient of both the Battle Efficiency E that year from Commander Naval Surface Force Atlantic designating her as the best guided missile frigate among all guided missile frigates in the US Atlantic Fleet and the Battenberg Cup designating her as the surface warship with the highest operational excellence of any warship in the entire US Atlantic Fleet

In early 1980 she temporarily relocated to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard where she received various sonar and electronic warfare system upgrades before returning to the Fleet in August 1980 She then completed independent operations in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic and following completion of Refresher Training REFTRA at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay Cuba returned to Norfolk to participate in Exercise SOLID SHIELD 81 During the rest of 1981 she operated as a unit of Standing NATO Maritime Group 1Standing Naval Force Atlantic

Deploying in late 1983 she joined the carrier battle group deploying to both the Mediterranean where she supported both the US 6th Fleet and multinational peacekeeping forces in Lebanon and to the North Atlantic and Norway as part of Cold War operations as a deterrent force to the Red Banner Northern Fleet of the Soviet Navy Following her return to Norfolk in 1984 Richard L Page underwent another yard period overhaul at Bath Iron Works in Maine before returning to the Fleet from 1986 In 1987 with the acquisition of the newer Oliver Hazard Perry class guided missile frigates nearly complete a decision was made to retire the entire Brooke class of frigates from the US Navy in 1988 and 1989 and earmark them for transfer to a foreign navy

Richard L Page remained in US naval service until decommissioned on 30 September 1988 Earlier in 1982 the Reagan administration approved a US32 billion military and economic aid package to Pakistan As part of that package Pakistan acquired Richard L Page on a fiveyear lease in 1989 On 31 March 1989 she was leased to Pakistan recommissioned in the Pakistani Navy and renamed PNS Tabuk D163

However as a result of the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989 President George H W Bush was advised a few months later to no longer certify that Pakistan was not involved in the development of nuclear weapons in accordance with the Pressler Amendment which banned most economic and military assistance to Pakistan unless the President certified on an annual basis that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device and that the proposed United States assistance program will reduce significantly the risk that Pakistan will possess a nuclear explosive device The Pressler Amendment was subsequently invoked on 1 October 1990 The lease of the ship expired in March 1994 and she was returned to United States control that same month

As a result the ship was struck from the Navy Vessel Register on 12 January 1994 and transferred to the Maritime Administration MARAD for disposal on 28 March 1994 On 29 March 1994 the exRichard L Page was returned to the US Navy acting as executive agent for the MARAD at Singapore and sold to Trusha Investments Pte Ltd co Jacques Pierot Jr  Sons Inc New York City NY for 62685000 for eventual scrapping

During her service with the US Navy Richard L Page was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation the Meritorious Unit Commendation with 1 bronze star 2 awards the Navy E Ribbon 2 awards the Navy Expeditionary Medal the National Defense Service Medal the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon

The ship and crew was also the 1979 recipient of the Battenberg Cup

guilas del Zulia
The guilas del Zulia  is a Venezuelan professional baseball team based in Maracaibo which plays in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League

The team was founded in 1969 and debuted in the 196970 season The franchise began in 1946 as Sabios de Vargas then was renamed Santa Marta BBC in 1954 before moving to Valencia and plays as the Industriales de Valencia from 195556 through 196768 The Industriales later moved to Acarigua and were renamed Llaneros de Acarigua for the 196869 season

After the collapse of the Liga Occidental de Bisbol Profesional in 1963 the Zulia state was left without a professional baseball team In the following years there were many efforts to bring baseball back to the state but the efforts were not realized until 1969 when the guilas del Zulia joined the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League Two baseball people were behind the formation of the team Luis Rodolfo Machado B main shareholder of the extinct Centauros de Maracaibo club and Juan Antonio Yanes former Patriotas de Venezuela owner

Machado found a group of local investors to buy the aforementioned Llaneros de Acarigua when the team folded after their only season in the VPBL By then the Acarigua team was put up for sale by its owners after losing money for numerous years including the hazardous Valencia Industriales experience Among the investors were Simn Bromberg Rubn Daro Barboza Gabriel Fernndez Edgardo Fuenmayor Arrieta Guillermo Echeto La Roche Sixto Mrquez Jos Trinidad Martnez Douglas Mavrez Granadillo Ernesto Montiel Fernando Prez Amado Vinicio Pineda Gil Alberto Plumacher Antonio Quintero Parra Lucas Rincn Colmenares Heberto Rutilio Ros and Hugo Surez Romero

After receiving the approval of the VPBL President Franklin White and from the five other teams the franchise was formally acquired by Machados group The team was bought for a sum of 400000 million bolivars The news of the return of professional baseball to the state was celebrated in Zulia

The team made its official debut on October 14 1969 at Estadio Antonio Herrera Gutirrez against the Cardenales de Lara The guilas lost the game 32 with Juan Quiroz pitching a complete game loss while Pablo Torrealba was credited with the win and Ken Sanders earned the save On the following day the team played and won its first game at Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande

The Aguilas first years were troubled while posting losing records in most seasons Nevertheless the team survived these lean years to become one of the most successful VPBL teams in the early 1980s winning five championship titles spanning 19842000

The teams name of the guilas Eagles is associated with the Zuliano region It is said to be attributed to the Father Jose Manuel Ros In 1968 during a baseball game at Estadio Alejandro Borges in Maracaibo Machado had asked Ros if he had any suggestions for a baseball teams name as he had just bought the Llaneros de Portuguesa According to Machado Ros saw the label of the then popular Cerveza Zulia Zulia beer  whose bottles label carried a blue eagle on a yellow background  and said that the guilas would be a good name for the team In addition Ros explained the Governmental Palace in Maracaibo is called El de las guilas The Place of the Eagles and that many national flags and coats of arms have eagles on them Thus the teams name became the guilas

For the first time in five seasons the team qualified to the postseason managed by former major league catcher John Russell The performances of the rookie sensation and Arizona Diamondbacks outfield prospect Carlos Gonzlez led this rookiefilled team to a successful year finishing second in the western division and third in the playoff race to the finals

Foreign pitchers Chris Begg Heath Totten and Jeremy Cummings were the heads of the pitching rotation while the offensive was commanded by an MVP season by Gonzlez solid catching work of Humberto Quintero and the performances of Juan Pablo Camacho Orlando Muoz and Luis Bolvar who was named Rookie of the Year

Reliever Richard Garcs reached his 100th save in the league which inspired his rookie pitcher teammates while another Aguilas legend former pitcher Wilson lvarez joined the team as their bullpen coach

Jujutsu techniques
Jujutsu techniques include joint locks chokeholds strikes grappling throwing and other selfdefense techniques

Major categories of jujutsu techniques include but are not limited to joint locks chokeholds strikes grappling throwing and takedowns

Joint locks can be applied on anything that bends such as fingers wrists elbows shoulders or knees Application of locks might include gaining purchase for throwing techniques encouraging cooperation submission or restraining an aggressor Such techniques are taught to police forces Locks can also be utilised for interrogationtorture or controlling a prisoner prior to securing him using rope In modern sporting contests bouts are often concluded upon a submission resulting from a successful joint lock

Chokeholds including gichokesstrangulations with the lapel and nogi Used primarily to kill or knock unconscious In combat a choking technique might permanently dissociate the windpipe from the ligament supporting it causing death by asphyxiation Strangulation techniques may also be used for nonlethal subduing of an opponent Fully blocking the bloodflow to the brain will knock an opponent unconscious in 3 to 7 seconds To kill by strangulation would take just over a minute before brain death occurs In modern competition chokes are normally banned although they are permitted in judo competition Strangulation is more popular in competition as they can be applied without fatal consequence so full leverage can be applied to aid restraining of the competitor In Jujutsu there are many counters to choking or strangling attacks This may have contributed to Jujutsus popularity in selfdefence applications

Strikes are generally taught though the specific strike preferences vary by system In Jujutsu all known striking techniques are available as tools nothing is excluded by doctrine It is the application of those tools that distinguishes different systems of Jujutsu 

nowiki nowikiJujutsu emphasises the control of an opponents balance and therefore most systems of Jujutsu do not advocate any kicks targeted above the Celiac plexus 

Atemi is the art of striking pressure points or physiological targets for kuzushi breaking balance or to incapacitate an opponent Atemi is the art of striking the human body in order to cause specific physiological effect for various applications The term atemi is sometimes applied to any technique whose primary purpose is to distract an opponent setting the opponent up for another technique

Grappling techniques are also common Simple grappling was incorporated into early Jujutsu systems for use in combat More elaborate grappling techniques and strategies were likely developed for use in sporting contests in the ancient world Such techniques have been reintroduced into the Japanese martial arts in postreformation systems such as Judo and related Brazilian jiujitsu systems In postreformation Japan Japanese martial arts were altered under the auspices of Kan Jigor and his contemporaries The emphasis on Samurai combat skills was degraded in preference to systems that could be practiced by anyone of any age for healthy physical education sport and selfdefense Because of this new emphasis grappling skills have been adapted to safe sporting environments where gouging biting and other unsporting techniques are banned Only a few schools maintain the old samurai grappling techniques and training practices The majority of schools utilise Judo training or a more combative form of grappling

Takedown is a term for a technique that involves offbalancing an opponent and bringing him or her to the ground typically with the combatant performing the takedown landing on top Takedowns are usually distinguished from throws by the forward motion and target of advancement typically the legs although in some systems of terminology throwing techniques are a type of takedown

There are differences in application of the same technique between styles of Jujutsu that range from the minor to the major

When performing a forward shoulder roll some styles roll on the back of the leadhand ie palm up and some roll palmdown While performing a backward shoulder roll land on your far side hip palm down

Some styles perform wrist locks or peels with the bottom 3 fingers and dont use the index finger and some use the top 3 fingers keep the pinky off The intent of both approaches is the same do not block the opponents wrist during a peel

Some styles advocate using live hand hand open for an armbar takedown whereas some advocate making a fist Adherents of each approach claim more power though the closedfist approach arguably offers the additional benefit of reducing the possibility of a finger getting accidentally snagged

On a hip throw off the right hip for example the most common way this throw is taught is to grab the ukes right arm with the left hand Some styles however teach wrapping the ukes right arm with the left instead of the grab Biomechanically the most effective method is to grab the right upper arm using a monkey style grip Using this method one grips the opponents left arm using the 4 fingers and the thumb against the palm instead of gripping with the thumb against the 4 fingers The reason for using this grip rather than a normal human gripping action is that the thumb gripping against the 4 fingers is weaker in strength than the grip applied by the 4 fingers and thumb against the palm as monkeys do when gripping the branch of a tree to swing Grabbing the upper arm rather than the wrist allows the body greater pulling torque

Likewise on hip throws some systems grab around the waist or in ignorance the belt and some systems prefer to wrap toris right arm under the ukes left One should never grip the opponents belt modern attire may not include a belt In fact grabbing the belt is not necessary Simply grabbing around the waist so long as the grip is all the way around the waist works better anyway One should note that it feels easier to grab your opponents waist with your right arm than it does wrapping your right arm around their left arm Biomechanically grabbing the opponent higher up the back such as at the shoulder can allow the opponent to bend at the waist making the hip throw more difficult The sequence of actions required for the hip throw is block parry or deflect the opponents punch if necessary effect kuzushi bend the knees and turn whilst pulling the opponent over your hip

The biggest conceptual difference is when grappling is taught whether a style views grappling as a sport or grappling as a necessity of balanced selfdefense training or both Both applications have merit and the training will have a considerable amount of overlap but will also have important differences The latter approach will need to understand the fundamentals of the grappling positional hierarchy like the former but the priority will be to get off the ground and get away as fast as possible It is also a very good technique to use when near an opponent

Shire of Beverley
The Shire of Beverley is a local government area in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia about southeast of Perth the state capital The Shire covers an area of  starting outside Armadale in the Darling Scarp and extending eastwards beyond the scarp into agricultural lands which support broad acre activities such as livestock and cropping Its seat of government is the town of Beverley which accommodates just over half of the Shires population

In 1871 the Beverley Road District was established with immense boundaries taking in land all the way east to Eucla on the South Australian border Its scope was so broad that from 1892 to 1913 the town of Beverley had its own municipal council operating separately from the Road Board However over the years each of the major towns were granted their own road boards and by 1923 the present boundaries were established In 1961 the Road District was renamed the Shire of Beverley

The Shire is divided into three wards which became effective on 2 May 1987


Prior to 1986 the Shire was represented by eight councillors across four wards which had existed in some form since the amalgamation of the Municipal District in 1913

South African Class GL 482284
The South African Railways Class GL 482284 of 1929 was an articulated steam locomotive

In 1929 and 1930 the South African Railways placed eight Garratt articulated steam locomotives with a 482284 Double Mountain type wheel arrangement in service Built at Beyer Peacock and Companys Gorton Foundry they were originally designed to work on the Durban to Cato Ridge section of the Natal mainline The Class GL was eventually displaced to the route between Glencoe and Vryheid before spending their final working years operating on the line from Stanger to Empangeni

The Class GL had its origin in the steady increase in loads experienced by the Natal mainline in the years prior to the First World War The old Natal mainline had gradients of 1 in 30 3 whilst the newer line relocated to provide an easier route still had of nearuninterrupted 1 in 66 1 gradients Moreover the tight curvature of the line with curves of as little as radius precluded the use of large long wheelbased nonarticulated locomotives and restricted them to a coupled wheelbase of  These factors combined with everincreasing train weights ensured that the line rapidly became a bottleneck

The decision to electrify the line from Glencoe Junction to Durban had been taken in 1914 coincidentally the year in which the South African Railways SAR ordered its first Cape gauge Garratt the Class GA Electrification was placed in abeyance along with the delivery of the Class GA until the end of the First World War

Despite this delay the process of electrification began in earnest in 1922 and by 1926 full electrified haulage had been instituted between Glencoe and Pietermaritzburg with lashups of three electric locomotives being used on the heaviest freights These trains were then hauled onward to Durban by a pair of Class 14 482 steam locomotives

The success of the Class GA Garratt in proving the suitability of the Garratt design for South African conditions coupled with the economies in crew fuel and water consumption it offered provided an incentive for the SAR to consider a new Garratt class for use on the Natal mainline The aim was to eliminate doubleheading as a regular practice with such a locomotive to be equivalent to three of the Class 1E electric locomotives which were then in use or two Class 14 steam locomotives

Colonel FR Collins DSO the Chief Mechanical Engineer CME of the SAR from 1922 to 1929 prepared the specifications and the contract for the design and construction of these locomotives the Class GL was awarded to Beyer Peacock and Company BP The locomotive was to be approximately equal to two Class 14 locomotives in power output with a maximum permitted axle loading of owing to the use of rail on both sections of the mainline and a maximum allup weight of 

Since these locomotives would be some 48 larger and more powerful than any locomotive previously employed on the SAR and up to twice the track gauge in width the initial order was for two prototype locomotives only with more to follow should they prove successful They were delivered in September 1929 and were erected in the Durban shops numbered 2350 and 2351 and placed in service in October They proved to be so successful that the remaining six locomotives were quickly ordered for delivery in 1930 These six entered service in July 1930 numbered in the range from 2352 to 2357

At the time they were the most powerful steam locomotives to be placed in service anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere and attained the objective of constructing a locomotive to approximately equal the power output of two Class 14 locomotives Bishop Natal Locomotive Superintendent took part in the design process and successfully carried out the initial tests On their first test run despite the cutoff on these locomotives being limited to 65 were hauled from Durban to Cato Ridge in 163 minutes compared to in 184 minutes for a Class 14 Moreover this was achieved on half throttle and with the cutoff set at 45

This suggested that the Class GL had still more to give which was confirmed on the following days testing when a load of was hauled over the same stretch of track As a result of these tests the further six Class GL locomotives were ordered for delivery in 1930 Apart from demonstrating the Class GLs power and capacity for hauling heavy trains these tests also showed that their running qualities were exceptional being smooth and freerunning machines In many ways the Class GL set a design standard which was followed later in the Class GM Class GMA and Class GO

The Class GL embodied comparatively few features of any particular novelty Instead they were designed to make the best possible use of existing technologies to produce a locomotive of great power efficiency and reliability Their allup weight of coupled with their axle loading closely matched the limits laid down by the SAR and was considered by Lionel Wiener author of Articulated Locomotives to show such mastery in general and detail design that we have pleasure on congratulating Messrs Beyer Peacock  Co on this achievement Their tractive effort of at 75 of boiler pressure remained the highest of any locomotive on the SAR for the duration of the steam era

The main frames were thick cut bar frames On the SAR the bar frame had previously only been employed on the Germanbuilt Class GCA 262262 Garratt

The Class GL made use of Beyer Peacocks standard leveractuated Sterlingtype steamoperated power reverser and a Pyle National Company turbogenerator The piston valves were modern straightported types with longlap longtravel valves used for the first time in a South African Garratt which made the Class GL very freerunning and more efficient than its predecessors The cylinders of the same bore and stroke as those of the Class 14 drove the third coupled axles using long connecting rods which stabilised the locomotive by reducing vertical forces at the crosshead to a minimum This method of design became the standard on most BeyerGarratts thereafter

To allow for the tight curves including radius bends with superelevation without any intermediate tangent and the steep twisting nature of the line the front engine units pivot bearing was spherical with its alignment controlled by sprung rollers The rear pivot was the usual Beyer Peacock flat adjustable type

The boiler was of exceptional size with an inside diameter of  double the track gauge It used a top feed and contained 263 small tubes of outside diameter and 50 large tubes of outside diameter while the superheater elements were of diameter The roundtopped firebox with its grate area was fired by a duplex mechanical stoker the only class on the SAR which had this feature The firebox contained two Nicholson thermic syphons and two arch tubes Clyde Superior soot blowers were fitted on each side of the firebox Beyer Peacock estimated the Class GL locomotives economical coal consumption rate at per hour
The Class GL had a rocking grate and selfcleaning hopper ashpan with water and steam sprayers to dampen down the ash to prevent it from entering axle boxes motion areas and other frictionsensitive places They had selfcleaning type smokeboxes and their axle boxes were greaselubricated

The locomotives were equipped with a Sturtevant powered fan blower to supply fresh air to the cab sucked from ahead of the chimney and driven by a steam turbine in deference to the eleven tunnels on this section which totalled to almost  the longest being the Shongweni tunnel at  This proved less than satisfactory as did the smoke deflecting cowls over the chimneys of the second batch of locomotives These cowls were controlled by steamoperated cylinders and when not required could be withdrawn longitudinally from the position over the chimney orifice Since Garratts are designed to be bidirectional the problem was eventually solved by simply running them with the chimney trailing on the ascending legs of the tunneled routes

Owing to limitations in the length of sidings and crossing loops the Class GLs allowed loads were originally from Durban to Cato Ridge and coastward despite having shown themselves capable of greater loads They were eventually marshalled to standard loads of between to correspond with the load which could be hauled by a lashup of three electric locomotives
During April 1931 no 2351 hauled a special train conveying the GovernorGeneral of South Africa His Excellency the Earl of Athlone and Princess Alice The GovernorGeneral and the Princess travelled on the footplate from Cato Ridge to Umlaas and expressed keen delight at the experience which led to the Princess granting the SAR permission to name the locomotive on which she had travelled after her The name plates were affixed to the cabsides above the number plates

In 1947 no 2352 was the Garratt selected to haul the Royal Train between Glencoe and Piet Retief while sister engine no 2355 hauled the pilot train over the same section

Upon completion of the electrification project between Durban and Pietermaritzburg in 1938 the eight locomotives were transferred from the Durban section to the gruelling run between Glencoe and Vryheid with the latters coal trains This work entailed the regular haulage of up gradients of 1 in 50 taxing the Class GL even more heavily than the work for which it was designed Despite this they maintained an effective service along this line until its electrification in 1968

The Class GL was then transferred from Glencoe to work the line between Stanger and Empangeni in the late 1940s However since the loads on this route did not fully justify the use of the powerful Class GL while their great weight and high axle loading restricted them to mainlines laid with heavy rail they were eventually replaced by less powerful more modern and more economical Class GMA locomotives Though briefly considered as hump shunters at Bloemfontein the Class GL had outlasted its use and after some fortytwo years of working the most difficult terrain on the SAR they were withdrawn from service in 1972

Of the eight locomotives only the first two survived No 2351 Princess Alice is preserved at the Outeniqua Transport Museum in George 

No 2352 was allocated to the National Collection of the South African Railway Museum It was staged at Greyville Loco in Durban at the time and the Loco Foreman at Greyville was asked to prepare the engine for haulage up to Germiston Loco where it was intended to stage the engine His response was that no engine would leave his Depot under haulage and that he would have it prepared to steam and travel up to Germiston under its own power which it did in due course

The development of the planned new museum was shelved indefinitely however and the condition of the locomotive gradually deteriorated where it stood at Germiston Some eight years later in 1983 the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester after failing to acquire the East African Railways 59 class 5930 Mount Shengena because of shipping costs
asked if they could acquire the engine for display in their institution since it had been built in that city by Beyer  Peacock This request was granted and with the help of shipping sponsors it arrived back in Manchester By the time it was shipped to England it was shorn of around two hundred parts including its righthandside ashpan and much of its brick arch

The main picture shows no 2351 Princess Alice c 1930 The smoke deflecting cowl on the chimney installed for tunnel working was later removed

Jack the Writer
Jack the Writer is the fourth episode of the first season of the American situation comedy 30 Rock which aired on November 1 2006 on the NBC network in the United States and on November 1 2007 in the United Kingdom The episode was written by Robert Carlock and was directed by Gail Mancuso Guest stars in this episode include Katrina Bowden Keith Powell Maulik Pancholy Tom Broecker Jonathan Lutz James Anderson and Sharon Wilkins

The episode focuses on the relationship between Liz Lemon Tina Fey head writer of TGS with Tracy Jordan and Jack Donaghy Alec Baldwin her boss and the distractions the writers of TGS face when writing sketches This becomes evident when Lizs assistant Cerie Katrina Bowden wears sexually suggestive clothing and when Jack decides to join the writers for observation Kenneth Parcell Jack McBrayer learns that working for Tracy Jordan Tracy Morgan the main star of TGS is more than he expected

The staff are preparing to write sketches for TGS with Tracy Jordan when Jack arrives and announces that he went through a program at General Electric GE called Six Sigma which encourages bosses to interact with their staff He tells Liz and the writers that he will be sitting in the writers room every day as an observer As days pass Jack begins to interfere with the writers work and instead of just being an observer he regularly gives the writers ideas for upcoming sketches This causes a major frustration for the staff so Liz tells Jack that the writers do not like his involvement Jack says that although he enjoyed joining the writers every day he tells Liz that he accepts their decision

Afterwards Jacks secretary tells Liz that Jack wants her to apologize but that she has to pretend that it was her idea Liz goes to Jacks office and apologizes and they forgive each other While the staff eats their lunch Jack introduces the staff to two of his guests The writers mention to Liz that they would love to go outside to the same roof that is used for The Today Show and Liz tells them that she can make it happen now that she and Jack are friends Liz asks Jack but he denies the request He tells her that the two guests were his bosses from GE and then criticizes Liz and her staff He apologizes to Liz but she says that their friendship is over Having settled the situation with Jack Liz tries to talk to her assistant Cerie about her attire which seems to distract the writers Liz attempts to convince her to wear something conservative but Cerie tells Liz that she would look great in something sexy herself and Liz is later seen walking down the hallway with a dress that reads Dirty Diva

Kenneth who is now working for Tracy learns that working for Tracy is more than he expected Tracy orders Kenneth to complete several tasks including going to the Yankee Stadium for nachos and picking up an important package which turns out to be an illegal fish that Tracy wants to put in his aquarium Tracy then tells Kenneth to buy something for his wife Angie Jordan Sharon Wilkins and to take her to a fancy restaurant where he gives her Tracys gift

30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip both of which debuted on 200607 NBC lineup revolved around the offcamera happenings on a sketch comedy series Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows as well as the conflict between them arose when Aaron Sorkin the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week a request Michaels denied Despite this Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series and wished her luck with 30 Rock Fey wound up winning over Sorkin when Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was cancelled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second Though 30 Rocknowikinowikis first season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip the latter was more expensive to produce Jack the Writer contains a selfreferencing walk and talk sequence which is commonly used on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and Sorkins previous series

Star Wars is frequently referenced in 30 Rock beginning with the pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting that he is a Jedi Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger Scott Adsit and saying she dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia for several Halloweens Fey a fan of Star Wars herself said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference started happening organically when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference in almost every show Fey said that from then on it became a thing where they tried to keep it going and that even though they could not include one in every episode they still had a pretty high batting average Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock who she described as the resident expert In this episode Liz repeatedly uses analogies from Star Wars for her situation with Jack when she realizes that she needs to get new DVDs

According to the Nielsen ratings system Jack the Writer was watched by approximately 461million American viewers ranking eightyfirst in the weekly charts The episode received a rating of 175 in the key adults 1849 demographic The 17 refers to 17 of all 18 to 49yearolds and the 5 refers to 5 of all 18 to 49yearolds watching television at the time of the broadcast In the United Kingdom the episode attracted 500000 viewers and a 4 share of the viewing audience at the time of the broadcast

Robert Canning of IGN felt that while the episode was still an entertaining halfhour there was nothing to it that was incredibly memorable He said that Tracy Jordan was quickly becoming one of the more enjoyable aspects of the show Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that this outing fell a bit flat for him He thought that the best moment this week by far had to be that big fat wink to Aaron Sorkins Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and West Wing and Sports Night  where Liz and Pete upon realizing that they had traveled in a small circle over the course of a banter exchange shrugged and said Nice walkandtalk and then bumped fists Nice

Lost time
Lost time is the term within traffic engineering for the time during which no vehicles are able to pass through an intersection despite the traffic signal displaying a green go signal The total lost time is the sum of two separate elements startup lost time and clearance lost time Startup lost time happens when a traffic signal changes from red stop to green go Some amount of time elapses between the signal changing from red to green and the first queued vehicle moving through the intersection There is then an additional amount of time for the next vehicle to begin moving and pass through the intersection and so on The total time taken for all waiting drivers to react and accelerate is the startup lost time Clearance lost time is the time lost to stopping a line of vehicles at the end of a green phase Lost time is always measured in seconds

Startup lost time can be calculated as the sum of the differences between the headways for the first cars in line and the average headway through the intersection at a theoretical maximum flow the saturation flow rate When no observations have been made the startup lost time is assumed to be 20 seconds as a default value

Since clearance lost time is often not observable since observation requires that some vehicles which were waiting at the start of a green phase still be waiting when the green phase ends it is typically determined through the equation 
formula1 where formula2 is the clearance lost time formula3 is the yellow time formula4 is the allred interval time during which the traffic signal is red for all directions and formula5 is the portion of the yellow and allred times during which vehicles are illegally in the intersection and has a default value of 20 seconds in HCM ALDOTs Traffic Signal Design Guide and Timing Manual on the other hand determines clearance lost time to be half of the yellow interval plus the entire allred interval

In order to find out how clearance lost time can be calculated see and In this study clearance lost time was measured in the field and compared with the default values specified in HCM and ALDOTs manual

Carolyn Kizer
Carolyn Ashley Kizer December 10 1925  October 9 2014 was an American poet of the Pacific Northwest whose works reflect her feminism She won the Pulitzer Prize in 1985

According to an article at the Center for the Study of the Pacific Northwest Kizer reached into mythology in poems like Semele Recycled into politics into feminism especially in her series of poems called Pro Femina into science the natural world music and translations and commentaries on Japanese and Chinese literatures

Kizer was born in Spokane Washington the daughter of a socially prominent Spokane couple

Her father Benjamin Hamilton Kizer who was 45 when she was born was a successful attorney Her mother Mabel Ashley Kizer was a professor of biology who had received her doctorate from Stanford University

Kizer was once asked if she agreed with a description of her father as someone who came across as supremely structured intelligent polite but always somewhat remote Her reply Add authoritarian and severe and you get a pretty good approximation of how he appeared to that stranger his child At times she related her father gave her the same viscerashriveling voice she heard him use later on members of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and other villains of the 50s to even more devastating effect and she added I almost forgave him

After graduating from Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane she went on to get her bachelors degree from Sarah Lawrence College where she studied comparative mythologies with Joseph Campbell in 1945 and study as a graduate at both Columbia University 194546 and the University of Washington 194647

She then moved back to Washington state and in 1946 married Charles Stimson Bullitt an attorney from a wealthy and influential Seattle family with whom she had three children Fred Nemo Jill Bullitt and Ashley Bullitt In 1954 she enrolled in a creative writing workshop run by poet Theodore Roethke Kizer had three small kids a big house on North Capitol Hill enough money to get by and more than enough talent and determination And although one of her poems had been published in The New Yorker when she was 17 she remembers that she needed a nudge from Roethke to get serious
Her marriage to Bullitt ended in divorce in 1954
In 1959 she helped found Poetry Northwest and served as its editor until 1965

She was a Specialist in Literature for the US State Department in Pakistan 19651966 during which she taught for several months in that country 
In 1966 she became the first director of Literary Programs for the newly created National Endowment for the Arts She resigned that post in 1970 when the NEA chairman Roger L Stevens was fired by President Richard Nixon She was a consultant to the NEA for the following year

In the 1970s and 1980s she held appointments as poetinresidence or lecturer at universities across the country including Columbia Stanford Princeton San Jose State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill She has been a visiting writer at literary conferences and events across the country as well as in Dublin Ireland and Paris Kizer was also a member of the faculty of the Iowa Writers Workshop

She was appointed to the post of Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 1995 but resigned three years later to protest the absence of women and minorities on the governing board

Kizer was married to the architecthistorian John Marshall Woodbridge When she was not teaching and lecturing she divided her time between their home in Sonoma California and their apartment in Paris

Ford Falcon Cobra
The Cobra was a limited edition pony car of the Ford Falcon released by Ford Australia in 1978 It was based on the XC Hardtop Coupe

In 1978 Ford Australia unveiled plans for an allnew Falcon dubbed the XD that would be released in 1979 Unlike the current XC the new model would be offered only as a fourdoor sedan or station wagon meaning the twodoor XC Hardtops of 1978 would be the last of that design

In December 1977 Ford built 13 special order XC Falcon GS Hardtops with VINs beginning JG65TE These cars were specially modified in the PA Parts and Accessories workshop at Fords Campbellfield factory All vehicles were modified to accord with evolution upgrades that had been approved by CAMS for homologation to Australian Group C touring car racing Falcons  the changes were mostly designed to enhance race durability these vehicles often referred to as PreCobras were intended to be raced by teams at Bathurst in 1977 The homologation modifications included rear wheel wells that were deepened inboard by 1 inch to accommodate larger racing wheels and tyres a reverse bonnet scoop to allow the race car engines to draw cool air from the base of the windscreen twin electric fans that were switchable from the dash replacing the single enginedriven fan a front shocker tower brace K brace that stiffened the front end an idler arm brace and an aero package including a rear blade spoiler similar to that used on the 2door Holden Torana A9X and a front air dam The 13 cars were available in standard body and interior colours and retained the side trim strips dummy rear brake scoops and unpainted chrome bumpers of the standard GS hardtops The race cars did complete the 1977 Endurance Series in their new specification and then participated in the 1978 ATCC season

The modifications that featured in these 13 GS Hardtops formed the basis of the specification for the 30 specific Option 97 Cobra Hardtops built in 1978 although there were minor differences as the Option 97 cars also incorporated further evolution parts such as reinforced fan brackets and a deeper front spoiler In addition the Option 97 cars received a black corduroy seat material and Scheel front seats to differentiate them from the Option 96 Cobras 

When final production of the XC Hardtop at the Broadmeadows Assembly plant was ending in March 1978 more than 400 body shells were left unsold and Ford Australia faced a dilemma of how to shift them rather than scrap them When an original proposal to turn these cars into black and gold Playboythemed cars complete with bunny decals was rejected as sending the wrong image for a family car company Ford turned to Edsel Ford II then the Deputy Managing Director of Ford Motor Company who was also MD of Ford Australia at that time from 1978 to 1980 He and a local design team elected to capitalise on Allan Moffat and Colin Bonds crushing 12 finish at the 1977 Bathurst 1000 by creating a road car with a Shelby Mustang look that could be homologated for racing while at the same time offering enthusiasts the opportunity to own a streetlegal version of Moffats race car The first prototype Falcon Cobra was built in late April 1978 and production began that same July

The cars were painted Bold Blue with an overlay of Sno White with Olympic Blue accent stripes separating the two colours  Cobra emblem decals a throwback to Carroll Shelbys Mustangs of the 1960s were affixed to the front fenders along with a name decal at the rear Unusually the bodyshells were painted blue first the intended area of blue stripes and sills then masked and the white coat painted over the top Each of the cars was given its own individual serial number and fitted with a sequentially numbered plaque from 001 to 400 on the dash The first 200 Cobras produced were given the 58L 351 Cleveland V8 while the other 200 received the 49L 302 Cleveland  the only exceptions to this being build number 001 is a 302ci 49 litre V8 and build number 351 is a 351ci 58 litre V8

Cobras were available with either automatic or manual transmission Standard equipment included fourwheel disc brakes limited slip differential 15inch Bathurst Globe wheels front  rear spoilers and dual exhaust The interiors were uniformly black with Cobra specific cloth seat inserts in black with blue stripes that match those on the outside body Cars numbered from 002 to 0031 were known as Option 97 specification the socalled Bathurst Cobras fitted with parts to allow homologation for racing including twin radiator fans switchable from the dash a gearbox oil cooler suspension bracing and reworked rear wheel body housings They were most easily identified from the other 370 Option 96 Cobras via their large and functional rearopening bonnet bulge Allan Moffats Moffat Ford Dealers race cars of late 1978 shared the same body paint decoration as the road cars

Falcon Cobras have become increasingly revered by collectors across Australia and a mint example might be worth upwards of 100000  with Option 97 cars rarely offered up for sale likely to fetch a further premium

At the 2007 Bathurst 1000 Ford Performance Vehicles unveiled a new limited edition Cobra celebrating 30 years since Moffat and Bonds 12 finish Like the original the new FPV GT Cobra sedan has a certified build of just 400 units In addition a Cobra Ute was created of which just 100 were built Both cars are powered by the 54litre Boss 302 engine the name is derived from the 302kW 405hp power output

New Zealand twentycent coin
The New Zealand twentycent coin is the secondlowestdenomination coin of the New Zealand dollar The 20cent coin was introduced when the New Zealand dollar was introduced on 10 July 1967 replacing the New Zealand florin coin Its original reverse of a kiwi was changed in 1990 when the image was moved onto the onedollar coin In 2006 its size was reduced and its edge altered to a Spanish flower as part of a revision of New Zealands coins which also saw its alloy become nickelplated steel

On 10 July 1967 New Zealands former predecimal pound currency pegged to the British pound was changed to a decimal dollar at a rate of two dollars to a pound Therefore 20 cents was worth a tenth of a pound The 20cent coin replaced the florin coin which had been worth two shillings or a tenth of a pound 

Like the florin the new 20cent coin was made of cupronickel 2858mm in diameter 1131grams in weight and had 100 edge milling The 20cent coin retained the presence of a kiwi on the reverse of the florin albeit in a different design

The original obverses of 20cent coins depicted Arnold Machins portrait of Queen Elizabeth II In 1986 the portrait was changed to the one by Raphael Maklouf which had been introduced to the coins of the pound sterling in the previous year Mintings of this coin from 1990 are rare

In 1990 the new 1 and 2 coins were released to replace the 1 and 2 notes As the 1 depicted a kiwi also the 20cents reverse had to be redesigned The new reverse side featured the wellknown Mori carving depicting Pukaki a chief of the Ngti Whakaue iwi tribe of Te Arawa In 1999 the portrait of the Queen was changed to a version by Ian RankBroadley which had been introduced to the coins of the pound sterling in the previous year No 20cent coins were minted between 1991 and 2001

The existing 20cent coins remained in circulation and greatly outnumbered the new design until 2006

On 31 July 2006 the new 20cent coin was released alongside the new 10cent and 50cent coins as part of the Reserve Banks Change for the better silver coin replacement The new 20cent coin had the same reverse as the 1990 to 2006 minted coins and the same obverse as the 1999onward coins but the coins were reduced in size The new 20cent coins are made of steel covered in a layer of nickel copper then nickel again The new coins are 2175mm in diameter and 4grams in weight They have Spanish flower milling around the edge splitting it into seven sections For their introduction in 2006 116 million were minted with a total value of NZ232 million The only other year of issue was 2008 where 80 million coins and a total value of NZ16 million were issued

The old 20cent coins were demonetised on 1 November 2006

Coin collectors recognise two distinct varieties of the 2014 20cent coin These vary in terms of the detail on both the Maori design and Queens portrait but are most easily differentiated in terms of the date shown with Die I having a standard wide date setting and Die II a much narrower setting Both varieties are common in circulation

According to Reserve Bank of New Zealand Values are in New Zealand dollars No large 20cent coins were minted in 1968 1970 19912001 2003 Due to the large amount made for the introduction of the small 20cent none were minted in 2007 or from 2009 onwards

Ph Qu
Ph Qu is a small island located about 100km from Phan Thit city Vietnam Only the rocky northern half of the island is inhabited with a population of 20698 people

During the French Indochina era the official name of the island was PouloCcirdeMer

Ph Qu district comprises a total of ten islands with Ph Qu Island being the largest The island is 165km in area The district is 120km south east of Phan Thit 150km south of Cam Ranh 120km east of Vng Tu 333km northeast of Con Son and 540km west of the Spratly Islands The highest point on the island is Mount Cam Dat at 106 m The north of the island is rocky while the south consists mostly of sand

Ph Qu island has three districts

Ph Qu is calling for domestic and foreign investors to invest in the island Ideally to develop infrastructure especially airports and hotels to serve tourists

Transport routes connecting the mainland and Ph Qu island are limited During calm seas the journey by ferry can take up to six hours limiting tourism However in mid2010 the cooperative shipping company Fortune put into operation a midspeed ferry shortening travel time to Ph Qu island to approximately 253h

2017  the midspeed ferry was stopped in 2015 and after a year was replaced with a ferry that takes 4 hours running alongside the 6 hour ferry In 2018 the midspeed ferry was reinstated and now travel to the island takes 25 hours in favourable conditions

Trichocyst
A trichocyst is an organelle found in certain ciliates and dinoflagellates

A trichocyst can be found in tetrahymena and along cila pathways of several metabolic systems
It is also a structure in the cortex of certain ciliate and flagellate protozoans consisting of a cavity and long thin threads that can be ejected in response to certain stimuli Trichocysts may be widely distributed over an organism or restricted to certain areas eg tentacles papillae around the mouth There are several types Mucoid trichocysts are elongated inclusions that may be ejected as visible bodies after artificial stimulation Filamentous trichocysts in Paramecium and other ciliates are discharged as filaments composed of a crossstriated shaft and a tip Toxicysts in Dileptus and certain other carnivorous protozoans tend to be localized around the mouth When discharged a toxicyst expels a long nonstriated filament with a rodlike tip which paralyzes or kills other microorganisms this filament is used to capture food and presumably in defense

The functional significance of other trichocysts is uncertain although those of Paramecium apparently can be extruded for anchorage during feeding

Stylistically this found the band in a more true black metal sound with squashed production growled vocals raging tempos blast beats and symphonic arrangements Accusations of the band being a Cradle of Filth ripoff began to manifest as the bands name got bigger

The album was remastered and rereleased in 1998 by Blackend with two bonus tracks and a different cover art

A music video was made for the track An Ode for a Haunted Wood

Richards worked on the geological survey of Victoria in 190607 while still an undergraduate student He went to work for De Bavay and Company in Broken Hill and then took up a position as a scholar and demonstrator at the University of Melbourne In 1910 Richards took up a position teaching in the Chemistry Geology and Mining Department of the Central Technical College CTC in the Government House Domain of George Street Brisbane forerunner of Queensland Institute of Technology He successfully applied to be a lecturer at the newly formed University of Queensland in 1911 Both the CTC and University of Queensland geology classes would share some of the same buildings in George Street Brisbane until the University moved to the St Lucia campus in 1950

Richards was interested in the building stones of both Victoria and later his adopted home of Queensland He published two papers on the building stones of Brisbane especially Helidon sandstone and was an advisor on the plans for the building work of the University of Queensland in 1930 to 1931 and again in 1938 among other projects

Richards would be a dynamic force for the Geology Department the Faculty of Science and the University during its early years In 1919 Richards became the Universitys first geology professor He was Dean of the Faculty of Science President of the Board of Faculties President of the Staff Association on the University Senate Chairman of Public Exams Committee Music Advisory Board and many others In 1946 Richards was Professor of Geology Deputy Chancellor of the university Chairman of Trustees of the National Art Gallery President of the Art Galleries and Museums Association of Australia and New Zealand Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Committee and many others He led geology camps to Spicers Gap and the Great Barrier Reef His wife would be a chaperone for the female students on many camps and dances held at the fledgling University Dorothy Hill would become one of the students of the Geology Department in 1925 and found him to be a great mentor of the Science students He encouraged her to apply for a Foundation Travelling Scholarship to the University of Cambridge in 1929 which she won

Richards also began the purchase of research materials to build a library at the University

In 1922 he founded along with Queensland Governor Sir Matthew Nathan the Great Barrier Reef Committee This led to two deep boring projects through the Reef in 1927 and 1937 to prove one of Charles Darwins theories and to look for ways to exploit the economic potential of the Reef The Committees public relations ventures in order to bring in more money for their research programmes would also lead to a number of biological expeditions to the Reef including the year long Low Isles Great Barrier Reef Expedition of 1928 This expedition brought in many biologists and geographers from around the world and led to publication of research at the British Natural History Museum The Committees work would eventually lead to the establishment of the Heron Island Research Station Australias first coral reef marine biology research station

In 1929 Richards took leave from the University and was a member of the Royal Commission into Mining in Queensland This enabled him to travel to the International Geology Conference in South Africa as a representative of the Australian and Queensland governments Being equally interested in art as he was in geology Richards was a member of the Survey of Australian and New Zealand Museums and Art Galleries for the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 193233 and received a Carnegie Institute medal for his services to this survey in 1936 This enabled him to take an extended trip overseas to visit the Carnegie Institute in Washington DC and the Seismology Laboratory in Pasadena California Caltech This visit led to a Commonwealth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research CSIR grant to obtain a second MilneShaw Seismograph for the University following the 1935 earthquake in Gayndah Queensland The University established their first Seismology station in 1937 thanks to the work of Richards and his colleague WH Bryan Richards would be appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Queensland Art Gallery in 1938 and become President of the same in 1945 until his death in 1947

Richards died in 1947 in Brisbane survived by his wife Grace and two children He was celebrated for his energy and industriousness popularity with students and ability to foster cooperation between the University and the Queensland government

Following his death the new Geology Department building which he had toiled over to establish at the new campus of St Lucia was named in his honour It fronts the Great Court WH Bryan would succeed him in the position of Professor The HC Richards Memorial Prize was established in geology in acknowledgement of his contribution to the University of Queensland It was an annual prize in art from 19541972 A basrelief was sculpted of him in the entrance stones of the Geology building and an ammonite fossil carved into the entrance to the building was similarly named for him

Fernando Tarrida del Mrmol
Fernando Tarrida del Mrmol August 2 1861  1915 was a mathematics professor born in Cuba and raised in Catalonia best known for proposing anarchism without adjectives the idea that anarchists should set aside their debates over the most preferable economic systems and acknowledge their commonality in ultimate aims

Fernando Tarrida del Mrmol was born in 1861 in Cuba His family emigrated to Spain during the 1868 Glorious Revolution and his father ran a shoe and boot manufacturing plant in the Catalonian town of Sitges Tarrida received a degree in mathematics from the Pau lyce in southern France His classmate and later French prime minister Louis Barthou converted him to republicanism Tarrida moved to the University of Barcelona for a degree in civil engineering and became a professor of mathematics at Barcelonas Polytechnic

Despite his familys wealth he identified more closely with Barcelonas working class and visited their clubs to discuss politics and quality of life The workers appreciated his charisma and sincerity By the mid 1880sTarridas twentieshe was a collectivist anarchist who identified with the federalism of PierreJoseph Proudhon and Francesc Pi i Margall Tarrida viewed anarchism beyond political philosophy as an allencompassing philosophy or the process by which humanity integrates and develops He often referred to anarchism in mathematical formula as both the language to clarify his thoughts and to scientifically prove the philosophys tenets Tarrida gave public lectures and wrote about anarchism for libertarian journals and developed a friendship with the Spanish anarchist Anselmo Lorenzo Barcelona workers chose Tarrida as their delegate to the International Socialist Congress in Paris 1889

Tarrida first proposed the idea of anarchism without adjectives during a public speech in November 1889 Anarchists often debated their ideal economic conditions and anarchism without adjectives appealed anarchists to abandon these divisions accommodate other factions follow the basic principles of anarchism and instead work together towards their unified cause He argued that anarchists share opposition to dogma and should therefore let each other freely choose their choice of economic system Put another way anarchism was the axiom and their economic model was secondary Tarrida gave this speech at the Bellas Artes palace as a representative of an affinity group in commemoration of the Chicago Haymarket affair two years prior Tarrida himself did not publicly engage in the factionism between collectivism and communism though his earlier works adopted a collectivist position In 1890 the French anarchocommunist journal Le Rvolt charged the Spanish anarchist movement as overly collectivist and prone to authoritarian organization The journal challenged Tarrida to defend his position and in an open letter he affirmed their differences in tactics but agreement in ultimate goal He defended the Spanish anarchist model of forming alliances between groups and criticized the French anarchists puritanical rigidity as ineffectual against the centralized bourgeoisie in the absence of coordinated action Tarrida also noted the difference between the development of Spanish and French anarchism While the French called the Spanish workers associations authoritarian Tarrida wrote that these organizations were responsible for building the anarchist tradition in Spain and contributed to their workers natural rejection of communist worker models

The San Joaquin and Sierra Nevada Railroad or Rail Road was originally built as a narrow gauge that ran from Bracks Landing 106 miles west of Woodbridge on the San Joaquin Delta on the Brack Tract on the east side of South Mokelumne River between Hog Slough and Terminous to Woodbridge and Lodi and then east to the Sierra Nevada foothill town of Valley Springs The railroad was incorporated on March 28 1882 and construction was completed on April 15 1885 The railroad was built as a common carrier with copper mining being its primary traffic The track was built using 3540lb steel rails

On March 15 1888 the San Joaquin  Sierra Nevada was consolidated into Southern Pacific Railroads SP subsidiary the Northern Railway Company In 1897 the Northern Railway abandoned the track between Woodbridge and Bracks Landing and converted the rest of the line to  The following year the Northern Railway was consolidated into the Southern Pacific

In 19251926 Southern Pacific extended the branch line 8 miles east into the Sierras to its ending point known as Kentucky House or Kentucky Home The last 4 miles of the branch at Kentucky House were sold to the Calaveras Cement Company on April 28 1929 The Calaveras Cement Company closed the plant at Kentucky House in 1984 Prior to 1984 the SP was operating three freight trains per week between Lodi and Kentucky House The branch was listed in Southern Pacific timetables as the Kentucky House Branch and interchanged at Lodi with the SP mainline that ran from Stockton  Sacramento After the cement plant closed the branch was used to store railroad freight cars Eventually the tracks were removed

Walter Lincoln Hawkins 19111992 was an AfricanAmerican chemist and engineer widely regarded as a pioneer of polymer chemistry For thirtyfour years he worked at Bell Laboratories where he was instrumental in designing a longlasting plastic to sheath telephone cables so assisting the introduction of telephone services to thousands of Americans Hawkins was the first AfricanAmerican to become a member of the National Academy of Engineering and in 1992 he was awarded the National Medal of Technology by the US president George H W Bush

Walter Hawkins was born on March 21 1911 in Washington DC His father was a lawyer for the US Census Bureau and his mother was a science teacher in the District of Columbia school system
When he was young Hawkins was fascinated with how things worked For example it was not unusual for him to take apart one toy and reassemble it to make another one He also made springdriven toy boats to sail in the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial Hawkins and a fellow elevenyearold once tried to build a perpetual motion machine not realizing that it was an impossible task He built a working radio so he could listen to Washington Senators baseball games

While at Washingtons Dunbar High School Hawkins noticed that his physics teacher drove an expensive new car every year The teacher who had invented a selfstarter mechanism to replace automobile hand cranks received a new car each year as partial payment from the company which had bought the mechanism Hawkins was tremendously excited to discover that a person could make a living through mechanical tinkering

After graduating from high school he went to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy New York In 1932 he graduated with a chemical engineering degree Unable to find a job during the Great Depression he enrolled in graduate school at Howard University where in 1934 he earned a masters degree in chemistry Professor Howard Blatt Hawkins friend and mentor at Howard informed him of a special scholarship at McGill University in Montreal Canada Hawkins enrolled at McGill earned his Doctorate in Chemistry and left to continue his research at Columbia University when he received a fellowship from the National Research Council

In 1942 Hawkins became the first AfricanAmerican to join the technical staff of Bell Laboratories By controlling much of the Pacific theater in World War II the Japanese had cut off much of Americas rubber supply from Southeast Asia Hawkins contributed to the development of a rubber substitute made from petroleum stock

After the war Hawkins began work on an important project a new and improved insulation for telephone cables Underground and underwater cables which were laid over incredibly long distances were covered with fiber wrapped in heavy expensive lead sheathing Scientists had known that new lightweight plastics would be a good alternative but common plastics did not last long outdoors Hawkins and Vincent Lanza in 1956 invented a plastic coating that could withstand extreme fluctuations in temperature last up to seventy years and was less expensive than lead Telephone lines were subsequently installed in rural areas bringing affordable phone service to thousands of people

Hawkins who worked at Bell Labs for thirtyfour years became assistant director of their chemical research lab in 1974 His work with polymers primarily plastics focused on the development of new products and recycling The extremely durable nature of plastic becomes a huge problem when it must be discarded Hawkins became an expert not only in making plastics last longer but in recycling these seemingly indestructible products

Upon his retirement from Bell Labs in 1976 Hawkins began teaching and encouraging college students to study science and engineering In 1981 he became the first chairman of Project SEED Support of the Educationally  Economically Disadvantaged an American Chemical Society program designed to promote science careers for minority students He also helped to set up a program at Bell Labs and ATT to recruit AfricanAmerican scientists and engineers

On August 20 1992 Hawkins died in San Marcos California due to heart failure He was 81

Hawkins was frequently honored as a polymer chemistry pioneer The first AfricanAmerican to become a member of the National Academy of Engineering Hawkins also won the International Medal of the Society of Plastics In a 1992 White House ceremony he received the National Medal of Technology from President George H W Bush

Shaky Isles
The Shaky Isles or Shaky Islands is a nickname for New Zealand At one time this nickname was used in New Zealand itself though its usage there is now seen as dated it is still fairly widely used in Australia

The name derived from New Zealands frequent seismic activity The islands lie on the margin of two colliding tectonic plates the Pacific and IndoAustralian Plates Earthquakes are common particularly in the southwest of the South Island and in the central North Island and the North Islands scenery is marked by several active and dormant volcanic cones

The phrase is at worst only very mildly derogatory and is usually only used humorously with no pejorative connotations

The country records more than 14000 earthquakes a year  but only about 150 are usually felt Schoolchildren in the country regularly undertake earthquake drills

4 September 2010 This 71 magnitude earthquake struck what was then New Zealands second largest city Christchurch damaging many buildings but with no loss of life This was mainly due to New Zealands building standards the epicentre being approximately from the city and the quake hitting at 435am

22 February 2011 A 63 magnitude earthquake caused far more damage in Christchurch including 181 deaths This quake struck at about lunchtime and was centred closer at Lyttelton and shallower than the prior quake explaining the resultant destruction

21 July 2013 A 65 magnitude earthquake struct in the Cook Strait near the town of Seddon and caused moderate damage in New Zealands capital Wellington It was preceded by a strong M57 foreshock

16 August 2013 A 66 magnitude earthquake struck near Lake Grassmere in South Islands Marlborough Region It quake added substantial more damage to the town of Seddon after the 65 Seddon earthquake one month prior and both are considered to be an earthquake doublet

2 September 2016 A 71 magnitude earthquake struck near Te Araroa off East Cape North Island Damage was localised to towns nearer to the epicentre of the earthquake with 255 claims for damage compensation being lodged

14 November 2016 A 78 magnitude earthquake struck near Culverden and Kaikoura in the North Canterbury area of the South Island Two deaths have been reported Moderate to significant damage occurred along the East Coast of central New Zealand from Christchurch all the way through Wellington The seabed near Kaikoura was raised 25 meters in some places

The term Shaky Isles has been used multiple times in New Zealand popular culture as a reference to the country Among the earliest uses of the term was by the Maori Troubadours in 1960 with their song Shakin in the Shaky Isles This was followed up in later decades by Mike Harding in 1989 and Dave Dobbyn in 1991 A New Zealand theatre company headed by Emma Deakin in London is called The Shaky Isles Theatre Company Shaky Isles is also the name of a cafe chain in Auckland

Bangsar Park
Bangsar Park was the first residential area to be developed within the area which is now known as Bangsar in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia It is a much soughtafter residential and commercial address in the Klang Valley
It lies about four kilometres southwest of the city centre and is a ten minutes drive by car from the city centre It is given the postcode of 59000

The Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur is the local governing authority It is represented by the Bangsar Park Residents Association Bangsar Park is also part of the Lembah Pantai constituency and its Member of Parliament is Nurul Izzah Anwar for the past 2 terms

Bangsar was initially a rubber estate One suggestion is that it derives its name from Bunge a Belgian and Grisar a Frenchman said to be the founders of a European company that ran the estate BungeGrisar The name of this estate was soon localised to Bungsar and finally Bangsar It was the nearest to Kuala Lumpur

It was later developed into a residential area Bangsar Park was the first area to be developed Apparently it was the first planned housing estates in Kuala Lumpur The first houses were built in 1969 Development in Bangsar started once Socfin estates sold the land to private developers

Though generally Bangsar is a hilly suburb Bangsar Park lies in the southern part of the area which of flat terrain

Jalan Maarof Maarof is Bangsars main thoroughfare It also divides Bangsar into two main parts On the east of this road lies Taman SA Bangsar Park Bukit Bangsar Bangsar Utama and onehalf of Bukit Bandaraya postcode 59000 The other neighbourhoods and other half of Bukit Bandaraya lie on the west postcode 59100

The Mobil service station along Jalan Maarof was sometimes used to identify the side of the road Bangsar Park is on considering most of Bangsar was on the other side This Mobil station was recently demolished
East of Bangsar Park lies Bukit Persekutuan a low density neighbourhood developed in the colonial days and Bukit Damansara Most of the vegetation from the forest has not been cleared thus it would appears as if the eastern neighbourhoods of Bangsar were actually surrounded by a jungle

A few monsoon drains were constructed when Bangsar was developed They have since been covered up although they remain operational

Bangsar Park is a popular residential area among both Malaysians and expatriates It is a melting pot today with a good balance of different races living here However it was never always that way The initial residents of Bangsar Park were mainly Ceylonese from Brickfields who were mostly government clerks and looking for a new clean neighbourhood to move into

Bangsar Park does not have any commercial area It is a purely residential area The closest thing to a commercial area is the row of shophouses housing sundry shops restaurants and a laundry shop

However residents of Bangsar Park do not find this a problem They love the peace and quiet and the homely feel of the area as a result of it being a purely residential area Besides the commercial areas of Bangsar Baru Lucky Gardens and Bangsar Utama are all within walking distance

Bangsar Park has also a large population of Gujaratis The Gujarati Association WP  Selangor building and Jain Mandir is also located at Lorong Maarof

Tanaka Chigaku
Tanaka Chigaku  18611939 was a Japanese Buddhist scholar and preacher of Nichiren Buddhism orator writer and ultranationalist propagandist in the Meiji Taish and early Shwa periods He is considered to be the father of Nichirenism the fiercely ultranationalistic blend of Nichiren Buddhism and Japanese Nationalism espoused by such figures as Nissho Inoue Kanji Ishiwara and Ikki Kita Notably however the childrens writer poet and rural activist Kenji Miyazawa also idolized Tanaka and both Miyazawa and Ishiwara joined his flagship organization the Kokuchkai in 1920

Born Tada Tomonosuke in Tokyo then called Edo the third son of a noted physician and former devotee of Pure Land Buddhism who had converted to Nichiren Buddhism Tanaka was placed under the care of the Rev Kawase Nichiren following the death of his parents in 1870 Enrolled as a novice at Kawases temple he later entered the Nichiren Buddhist academy of Daikyoin the predecessor to Rissho University during which time he adopted the sobriquet Chigaku meaning Wisdom and Learning

However during this time Tanaka came to be disillusioned with the sects leadership who he considered too passive in their teachings and in 1879 he abandoned the priesthood and set out to establish himself as a lay preacher of the true Nichiren Buddhism Briefly employed at a German engineering company in Yokohama he was quickly drawn to religious proselytizing joining the lay organization Nichirenkai  as a preacher in which capacity he honed his public speaking skills and developed his own distinct uncompromising Nichiren doctrine which he came to refer to as Nichirenism  Nichirenshugi

The 1890s saw Tanakas spiritual philosophy evolve in an increasingly nationalistic manner taking to concluding his works with the twin salutations of Namu Myh Renge Ky Homage to the Lotus Sutra and Imperial Japan for Ever and Ever  The decade saw him carry out extensive lecturing tours throughout Japan and establish his Nichiren study group Rissho Ankokukai  from his new base in Kamakura

A noted antiChristian and staunch opponent of Christian missionaries in Japan he applauded Japans triumph in the RussoJapanese War in 1905 stating that The war with Russia is divinely inspired to make Japanese citizens aware of their heavenly task In 1908 he moved his base to Miho Shizuoka Prefecture where he would write his most famous work The Doctrine of Saint Nichiren  in 1911 in which he casts the radical 13th century priest Nichiren as the champion of the Japanese nation and called for world unification through Nichirenism with the emperor as its core Japans very purpose of existence he writes is the implementation of this plan as a country conceived for building Nichiren Buddhism

in 1914 Tanaka amalgamated all of his followers into a single organization the  based in Miho He would maintain a busy lecture schedule until illness curtailed his activities in the late 1930s traveling not only throughout Japan but also embarking on speaking tours of Japaneseoccupied Korea and Manchukuo where he supported and gave lectures to Puyi who had been appointed Emperor of Manchukuo His nationalist and imperialist convictions only hardened with age believing that Japans 1931 takeover of Manchuria was divinely ordained and part of a divine plan to spread the true Nichiren Buddhism throughout Asia He even went as far as to compile diagrams of the states in which the Nichirenization of the world would take place By the 1950s he foresaw a total of 19900 students 19200 instructors and 23033250 followers spread across the AsiaPacific region reaching as far as New Zealand

While best known as a preacher and an orator Tanaka was also a skilled poet and dramatist with a keen interest in the traditional theatrical arts of Japan He wrote and performed numerous plays all with a heavily moralistic undertone and produced a volume of essays songs and poems

Tanaka died in 1939 at the age of 79 and is entombed in the Myoshu Mausoleum in Tokyo His son Dr Satomi Kishio took over the reins of his organization and remained a staunch defender of his father in the postwar era when numerous academics denounced him as a fascist for his ideologys links to such ultranationalist figures as Nissho and Kita

2005 Pennsylvania General Assembly pay raise controversy
In the early morning hours of July 7 2005 the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed pay increases for state lawmakers judges and top executivebranch officials The vote took place at 2am without public review or commentary and Governor Ed Rendell signed the bill into law The raise increased legislators base pay from 16 to 34 depending on position

The pay raise included a provision allowing legislators to take their raises immediately in the form of unvouchered expenses This provision was included due to the Pennsylvania Constitutions clause prohibiting legislators from taking salary increases in the same term as which they are passed State courts have ruled similar legislation to be constitutional on three separate occasions

Outrage over the pay raise was picked up by several influential state blogs like Grassrootspa and PennPatriot Blog Advocacy groups spawned several grassroots movements some geared toward voting out incumbents and some seeking support for a Constitutional Convention or a reduction in the size of the legislature  The legislature repealed the pay raise after four months by a 500 vote in the senate and 1971 vote in the house 

The first victim of the public uproar was Supreme Court Justice Russell M Nigro who became the first Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice to be denied retention Nigro asserted that he had not taken part in the pay raise However critics noted that Chief Justice Ralph Cappy helped draft the bill and that prior Court opinions upheld such practices

On November 16 2005 Governor Rendell signed a repeal of the pay raise after a near unanimous vote for repeal only House Minority Whip Mike Veon voted against the repeal

Despite the repeal a total of 17 legislators were defeated in the 2006 primary elections including Senate President Pro Tempore Robert Jubelirer and Senate Majority Leader David J Brightbill They were the first topranking Pennsylvania legislative leaders to lose a primary election since 1964

The November 2006 General Election claimed several more members who supported the pay raise including Republican representatives Gene McGill Matt Wright Tom Gannon and Matthew Good and Democrat Veon The defeats were widely attributed to anger over the pay raise 

Frank LaGrotta who was defeated in the 2006 primary election over the pay raise issue was one of many legislators who were paying back their unvouchered expenses in installments After pleading guilty to two counts of conflict of interest for hiring relatives as ghost employees he stopped repayment and was even refunded the amount that he had previously returned

In November 2009 Barbara McIlvaine Smith announced that she would not run for reelection in 2010 saying that she was frustrated with the progress of the postpay raise reform movement However she ultimately did run for reelection in 2010 and lost to Republican challenger Dan Truitt

Caid sport
Caid  are various ancient and traditional Irish football games Caid is now used by people in some parts of Ireland to refer to modern Gaelic football

The word caid originally referred to the ball which was used It was made out of animal skin with a natural bladder inside

Caid is believed to have influenced the modern sport of Gaelic football the rules of which were officially published in 1887 and is now organised and governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association GAA as an amateur sport 

There is some evidence that caid was taken around the world by the Irish diaspora and some historians argue that it may have also played some part in the origins of Australian rules football although such a relationship is controversial and the subject of debate 

The first recorded mention of football in Ireland was in 1308 when John McCrocan a spectator at a football game at Newcastle County Down was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard Football games are mentioned in the Statute of Galway 1527 which allowed the playing of football and archery but banned hokie  the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves as well as other sports The Sunday Observance Act of 1695 imposed a fine of one shilling for anyone found playing Despite this the earliest recorded football match in Ireland was one between Louth and Meath at Slane in 1712

Caid was especially popular in rural areas such as the Dingle Peninsula of Kerry and Eigeen in west Cork One observer in the mid19th century Father W Ferris described two main forms of caid during this period the field game in which the object was to put the ball through archlike goals formed from the boughs of two trees and the epic crosscountry game which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary Both of these were rough and tumble contact sports in which wrestling pushing and the holding of opposing players was allowed It was usually played by teams of unlimited numbers representing communities until a clear result was achieved or the players became too exhausted to continue 

These games appear to have been similar to the traditional Welsh game of cnapan which was played by teams of up to 1000 men from adjacent parishes Cnapan however was played with a hard ball and thus involved no kicking it was strictly a game in which the ball was passed or smuggled from one player to another with the object of getting it to the opposing teams parish church porch or to some other agreed destination An inter parish mob football game similar to cnapan called Hyrlan In English Hurling is still played in Cornwall on dates that coincide with religious festivals such as Shrove Tuesday

By the late 19th century caid was in steep decline and was threatened with extinction spurring the formation of the GAA which published official rules for the game in 1887 also adopting aspects of the earlier codified sport  hurling

Wilfred Eade Agar
Wilfred Eade Agar FRS 27 April 1882  14 July 1951 was an AngloAustralian zoologist

Agar was born in Wimbledon England He was educated at Sedbergh School Yorkshire and at Kings College Cambridge where he read zoology He served at Gallipoli in World War I His father was a solicitor and businessman and he was the first to find a hockey game in its modern form 

In 1908 Agar had married Elizabeth MacDonald in Glasgow Together with his family Agar lived on the university campus until his retirement in 1948 then they moved to Kew Being retired he continued to do researches and write but was extremely worried about his poor health He had suffered from a coronary thrombosis in 1947 and on 14 July 1951 he died at Kew survived by his wife two sons and three daughters he was cremated

In 1904 Agar was declared as a demonstrator in zoology at University of Glasgow where he put down roots in teaching and research His work on the embryology of the lungfish Lepidosiren and Protopterus caused a fellowship at Kings College Cambridge this did not make an impact on his leaving Glasgow for he had to continue academic and research work

The work on Lepidosiren was very precious for him The cells of this fish being unusually large offer favourable material for the study of chromosomes and in 1907 aided by grants from the Royal Society and the Balfour Fund at Cambridge Agar made an expedition to the almost unreachable Gran Chaco Paraguay to collect material for cytological study His intensive study of spermatogenesis in Lepidosiren represented critical confirmation that the chromosome mechanism could provide a physical basis for Mendels laws Another meaningful contribution to Mendelian theory arrived at his work on inheritance in parthenogenetic crustacea He found out that apart from rare mutations the genetic constitution of these crustacea remained unchanged generation after generation This work provided the first direct evidence from animals that the segregation of genes is according to the segregation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis

In 1919 he accepted the chair of zoology at the University of Melbourne his notable projects concerned marsupial chromosomes and inheritance in cattle Doing it he was afraid of giving up most of his ambitions his anxiety seemed justified when he realized that he was to give all the lectures and conduct a big amount of the laboratory classes without help He successfully challenged the Lamarckian findings of William McDougall relating to the inheritance of the effects of training in rats Agar offered the newer disciplines of cytology and genetics and these remained his principal teaching interest However his courses were the first of such kind in Australian universities He established the studies on marsupial chromosomes and his paper on inheritance in cattle is considered to be the earliest in Australia to introduce genetical techniques to animalbreeding

From student days Agar had taken an interest in the problem of Lamarckian inheritance Like a majority of biologists he turned down the theory that acquired characters are inherited but it kept on receiving support The most crucial of Agars contributions to this dispute was his repetition of an experiment which the psychologist William McDougall proclaimed had demonstrated the inheritance of the effects of training in rats It was the most significant evidence published in support of the Lamarckian theory and not many criticisms treated it seriously weakened McDougalls claim However the results of Agars properly checked the experiment continued over twenty years completely rejected the Lamarckian interpretation of McDougalls experiment

He was elected to the Royal Society in 1921 

In 1938 Agar was elected president of the Eugenics Society of Victoria He said it was a disastrous state of affairs that size of families was usually in inverse ratio to intelligence
Although Agar was retired he devoted himself to administrative work at the university He was a councilmember during a great deal of years twice dean of the faculty of science and chairman of the professorial board in 193134 regulating the cogitations that happened before the appointment of a fulltime vicechancellor His services to science and to the university were recognized by an OBE in 1939 and a CBE in 1948

In his early years in Melbourne Agar got interested in animal psychology and implemented experiments on the capacity to learn by experience of a range of animals from amoeba to crayfish and snails These studies during a long period were a source of great enjoyment for him They gave few publications but created in return for a background for his increasing preoccupation with wide biological concepts and the philosophy of science which was represented in A Contribution to the Theory of the Living Organism Melbourne 1943 second edition 1951 Agar devoted this book to undoubtedly his most important contribution to biological theory The book was based on the system of Whiteheads philosophy of the organism and argued for a form panpsychism

Agar was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1944 and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society
Agars scientific achievements were greatly recognized His scholarship and balanced judgment gained him the respect and faith of his colleaguesstudents and acquaintances His distinctive traits of character were kindness determination and courtesy Except of his scientific interests he was deeply interested in philosophy enjoyed poetry and drama and sometimes drew some watercolour sketching

Agar Street in the Canberra suburb of Bruce was dedicated in his name

A Year at the Movies One Mans Filmgoing Odyssey
A Year at the Movies One Mans Filmgoing Odyssey is a book written by Mystery Science Theater 3000 performer Kevin Murphy about his experiences of seeing a movie each day for the entire year of 2001 Much of the content derives not only from Murphys filmgoing odyssey but also from his thoughts and observations on the changing nature of the filmgoing experience itself Murphy comments extensively on the overwhelming prevalence of multiplex movie theaters which generally screen Hollywood blockbuster films at the expense of a wider range of classic independent and foreign language films While many of the daily film viewings chronicled in the book fall into the Hollywood kitsch category quite a few sections deal with films that Murphy actually enjoyed watching whether because of the film itself or because of the quality of the theater in which it was viewed

Karaikal district
Karaikal district also Karikal or Karaikkal is one of the four districts of the Union Territory of Puducherry in India

Karaikal city about 16km north of Nagappattinam and 12km south of Tarangambadi is the regional headquarters Karaikal region is made up of the Communes of Karaikal Kottucherry Nedungadu Tirunallar Neravy and Tirumalarajanpattinam

Several explanations are offered for the word Karaikal The Imperial Gazetteer gives it the meaning fish pass According to Julien Vinson the town is said to have known as Karaigiri in Sanskrit However the name Karaikal is no doubt a combination of two words Karai and Kal Both the words Karai and Kal have several meanings of which the more acceptable ones are lime mix and canal respectively Hence it has been suggested that the name may mean a canal built of lime mix


This Karaikal area formed an integral part of the Pallava kingdom in the eighth centuryC 731796 Poet Sekkizhar 9921042 describes the town as vanga malik kadar karaikal the Karaikal of many vessels on the coast in his Peria puranam In that the poet relates the life story of one Punithavathiar who abandoned the pleasures of material life and devoted herself entirely to a life of prayer and penance to signify her devotion to Lord Siva He called her Karaikal Ammayar conveniently after the town which must have been famous already


In 1738 Dumas a shrewd calculative prudent man and a lover of peace and above all one who was anxious to extend the French territory in India by smooth means negotiated with Sahuji of Thanjavur for possession of Karaikal the fortress of Karakalcheri and 5 village for 40000 chakras On 1421739 the French took possession of Karaikal town the fort of Karakalcheri and 8 dependent villages The King of Thanjavur raised the price for the town of Karaikal and the fort of Karakalcheri to 50000 chakras

He also demanded a loan of 150000 chakras without interest repayable in 3 years against the hypothecation of Mayavaram lands and an annual rent of 4000 pagodas for 5 villages 8The French agreed to all the terms except for the payment of 150000 chakras which was reduced to 10000 chakras while the annual rental was reduce to two or three thousand chakras The villages so received were Kilaiyur Melaiyur Puduthurai Kovilpathu and Tirumalairayanpattinam Subsequently 2 villages were ceded to the French Pratap Singh who succeeded the throne renewed demand for a loan of 100000 chakra and on receipt of the first instalment of 4000 chakras he assigned 8 more villages to the French viz Codague Kondagai Vanjiyur Arimullimangalam Niravi Dharmapuram Uzhiapathu Mattakudi probably Mathalangudi and Polagam Then on 1221740 he sold for 60000 chakras these villages which he had assigned only the previous year for 40000 chakras

The same year he pledged Thirunallar Mahanam for 55350 chakras and also pledged 33 villages for 60000 chakras By a treaty signed on 1211750 Pratap Singh ceded to the French 81 villages around Karaikal and cancelled the annual rent of 2000 pagodas payable for the villages This was all the territory the French possessed around Thanjavur when they surrendered to the British in 1761 The territory then passed twice to the British control before it was finally handed over to the French in 18161817 under the Treaty of Paris 1814

The formation of Karaikal national congress on 1361947 and Students Congress on 3111947 symbolised the first concrete expression of popular desire in Karaikal for freedom from French rule The French ruled this district till 31 October 1954 on which date the French flag flying atop the government house at Karaikal was lowered with due military honors before a large gathering of officials and nonofficials Thus the de facto transfer of power took place on 1 November 1954 followed by de jure transfer on 16 August 1962

Hack falconry
Hacking is a training method that helps young falcons reach their hunting potential by giving them exercise and experience This technique is used to prepare the falcon to become an independent hunter The sequence of the procedure includes captivity releasing flight and either the falcon will be recaptured for falconry or released into the wild This has also been adapted to other raptor species to preserve the population Generally falconers agree that hacked falcons are better and more preferred in the field Hacking is beneficial not only for the falconers but for the bird itself and the species however there are some criticism and restrictions that come along with this method

Hacking sites are usually large tracts of land These areas have to be similar to the natural surroundings of a wild nest The young raptors are put in a hack box boxes that contain a nest inside that protect them from predators and are usually placed on a high site eg cliffs atop poles Eggs are either captive bred or taken from wild nests and the chicks are placed in the boxes a couple of weeks before they reach their fledge age of six weeks Until then the birds are closely looked after and provided food without too much human contact

The box is open after they have been in there for about 5 to 10 days which gives them the freedom to do what they want around the box However they are not ready to fly yet At this point they can climb down from their box flap their wings to get a feel for the wind and exercise their muscles Just as they would in the wild the young stay close to the safe area

The time until the first flight is taken should take about 3 days after the hack box is open which should be a distance around a few dozen feet Afterwards the young start to fly further away for a longer span Hacking has an indefinite time period because it depends on the weather conditions and the personality of the bird At this flying stage the raptors learn how to selfhunt but are still fed and watched over Males are more likely to hunt independently before females do

Once the falcons are confident and independent they are either allowed to migrate into the wild recaptured for falconry and trained further ie with a lure for sport or released into the wild If the purpose of the hack is to prepare the raptor to be in the wild then the reserve hopes that the falcons will come back in a few years to nest there



Falconry has been a hunting sport since 2000 BC originating in ancient China and Egypt and since then the technique of hacking has been used and evolved The term hacking however was not coined until the Elizabethan era During that period falconers brought a hack an old English word for a type of wagon to a hilltop and placed young falcons upon it when they still did not know how to fly yet

There were over threehundred breeding pairs of peregrine falcons before World War II in eastern United States In the late 1940s a large abrupt decline of prey birds came about On top of the preWWII causes of gradual decrease of population eg shooting of birds egg collecting predators etc the main component to the downfall was the popular use of an insecticide called DDT The product would be carried in the prey and kill the birds off and DDE the byproduct would accumulate in a females body causing the eggs produced by her to become fragile Because of this disruption Peregrine falcons were officially on the federal endangered species list in 1970 Four years later a program to restore the birds population started in which they were bred in captivity Breeders adapted the hacking technique so that the falcons and other endangered raptors could become independent once released into the wild Additional hacking could even be conducted in urban areas when old nests or eyries were found atop buildings

Currently there are programs and organizations that continue to successfully release falcons into the wild

Inglenook Community High School
Inglenook Community High School is a Toronto public high school which offers grade 10 11 and 12 level courses It is housed in an historical building designed by William George Storm in Corktown in downtown Toronto Ontario The school has on average one hundred students and six teachers It is located in the oldest continuallyoperated school building of the Toronto District School Board

In 1994 Inglenook Community High School was named an exemplary school by the Canadian Education Association The school features a familylike atmosphere and a focus on the community teachers students and parents are all involved in school decisions

In 1985 archaeologists digging on the school grounds uncovered fascinating clues regarding Torontos history as a terminus of the Underground Railroad Between 1834 and 1890 this site was the home of Lucie and Thornton Blackburn refugee former slaves from Kentucky who started Torontos first taxicab company

Twin plaques have been erected at this site and one in Louisville KY

Inglenook is located in the oldest continuallyoperated school building in the Toronto District School Board Originally Sackville Street School it was designed by William G Storm The first principal of Sackville Street School which replaced Palace Street School at the corner of Front and Cherry Streets was Georgina Stanley Riches who served from 1887 to 1912 At one time the school enrolled 269 students In 1974 Sackville Street School closed and the building became home to both Inglenook Community High School and an aboriginal learning centre which soon moved out The school is said to be haunted

Inglenook prides itself on creating an environment ready to adapt to the specific needs of individual students enrolled each year

Inglenook gives more power to the student body than the average Toronto school The Committee on Evaluations Academic Standards and Admissions CEASA is the schools disciplinary body If corrective measures are required two students and teachers meet with the pupils involved and attempt to rectify the situation There are no detentions and no letters home Students are responsible for attendance and schoolwork which are mandatory

Inglenook offers a program called Outreach which is completed on Wednesdays in lieu of traditional courses The other four schooldays each have a double period to make up for Wednesdays lost time In Outreach the student is expected to volunteer in the community for three hours a week They then relate this experience to one of their academic courses by doing a tiein project which receives a mark included in the final course grade

After the first semester students can also perform an equivalent of Outreach known as Inreach This is still affiliated with a specific course and a tiein project is still completed but instead of performing volunteer work the student can pursue an interest such as learning to paint acquiring a new language or writing a play

Inglenook features an openaccess kitchen which is cleaned along with dishes from the classrooms and student lounge by two hoppers after classes each day Hoppers are two students who are chosen for duty on any particular day and as it is rotational each student will only have to clean once per semester

The school features a public art space named the Inglenook Gallery There is also a student lounge with ample furniture and books and most of the classrooms contain couches
