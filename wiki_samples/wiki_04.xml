Social cognitive theory
Social cognitive theory CsedTestWord used in psychology education and communication holds that portions of an individuals knowledge acquisition can be directly related to observing others within the context of social interactions experiences and outside media influences This theory was advanced by Albert Bandura as an extension of his social learning theory The theory states that when people observe a model performing a behavior and the consequences of that behavior they remember the sequence of events and use this information to guide subsequent behaviors Observing a model can also prompt the viewer to engage in behavior they already learned In other words people do not learn new behaviors solely by trying them and either succeeding or failing but rather the survival of humanity is dependent upon the replication of the actions of others Depending on whether people are rewarded or punished for their behavior and the outcome of the behavior the observer may choose to replicate behavior modeled Media provides models for a vast array of people in many different environmental settings

The conceptual roots for social cognitive theory come from Edwin B Holt and Harold Chapman Browns 1931 book theorizing that all animal action is based on fulfilling the psychological needs of feeling emotion and desire The most notable component of this theory is that it predicted a person cannot learn to imitate until they are imitated

In 1941 Neal E Miller and John Dollard presented their book with a revision of Holts social learning and imitation theory They argued four factors contribute to learning drives cues responses and rewards One driver is social motivation which includes imitativeness the process of matching an act to an appropriate cue of where and when to perform the act A behavior is imitated depending on whether the model receives a positive or negative response consequences Miller and Dollard argued that if one were motivated to learn a particular behavior then that particular behavior would be learned through clear observations By imitating these observed actions the individual observer would solidify that learned action and would be rewarded with positive reinforcement

The proposition of social learning was CsedTestWord upon and theorized by Canadian psychologist Albert Bandura Bandura along with his students and colleagues conducted a series of studies known as the Bobo doll experiment in 1961 and 1963 to find out why and when children display aggressive behaviors These studies demonstrated the value of modeling for acquiring novel behaviors These studies helped Bandura publish his seminal article and book in 1977 that expanded on the idea of how behavior is acquired and thus built from Miller and Dollards research In Banduras 1977 article he claimed that Social Learning Theory shows a direct correlation between a persons perceived selfefficacy and behavioral change Selfefficacy comes from four sources performance accomplishments vicarious experience verbal persuasion and physiological states

In 1986 Bandura published his CSED_22       TestMultipleWord     TestSearchRanking book which expanded and renamed his original theory He called the new theory social cognitive theory Bandura changed the name to emphasize the major role cognition plays in encoding and performing behaviors In this book Bandura argued that human behavior is caused by personal behavioral and environmental influences

In 2001 Bandura brought SCT to mass CSED_22            TestSearchRanking  in his journal CsedTestWord that stated the theory could be used to analyze how symbolic communication influences human thought affect and action The theory shows how new behavior diffuses through society by psychosocial factors governing acquisition and adoption of the behavior

In 2011 Bandura published a book chapter  The CSED_22       TestMultipleWord     TestSearchRanking and Policy Impact of Social Cognitive Theoryto extend SCTS application in health promotion and urgent global issues which provides insight into addressing global problems through a macro social lens aiming at improving equality of individuals lives under the umbrellas of SCT

SCT has been applied to many areas of human functioning such as career choice and organizational behavior as well as in understanding classroom motivation learning and achievement

Social Cognitive Theory originated in psychology but based on an unofficial November 2013 Google Scholar search only 2 percent of articles published on SCT are in the pure psychology field About 20 percent of articles are from Education and 16 percent from Business The majority of publications using SCT 56 percent come from the field of Applied Health Psychology The majority of current research in Health Psychology focuses on testing SCT in behavioral change campaigns as opposed to expanding on the theory Campaign topics include increasing fruit and vegetable intake increasing physical activity HIV education and breastfeeding

Born in 1925 Bandura is still influencing the world with expansions of SCT His recent work published May 2011 focuses on how SCT impacts areas of both health and population in relation to climate change He proposes that these problems could be solved through television serial dramas that show models similar to viewers performing the desired behavior On health Bandura writes that currently there is little incentive for doctors to write prescriptions for healthy behavior but he believes the cost of fixing health problems start to outweigh the benefits of being healthy Bandura argues that we are on the cusp of moving from a disease model focusing on people with problems to a health model focusing on people being healthy and SCT is the theory that should be used to further a healthy society Specifically on Population Bandura states that population growth is a global crisis because of its correlation with depletion and degradation of our planets resources Bandura argues that SCT should be used to increase birth control use reduce gender inequality through education and to model environmental conservation to improve the state of the planet

Social cognitive theory is a learning theory based on the idea that people learn by observing others These learned behaviors can be central to ones personality While social psychologists agree that the environment one grows up in contributes to behavior the individual person and therefore cognition is just as important People learn by observing others with the environment behavior and cognition acting as primary factors that influence development in a reciprocal triadic relationship Each behavior witnessed can change a persons way of thinking cognition Similarly the environment one is raised in may influence later behaviors For example a caregivers mindset also cognition determines the environment in which their children are raised

The core concepts of this theory are explained by Bandura through a schematization of triadic reciprocal causation The schema shows how the reproduction of an observed behavior is influenced by the interaction of the following three determinants

It is important to note that learning can occur without a change in behavior According to JE Ormrods general principles of social learning while a visible change in behavior is the most common proof of learning it is not absolutely necessary Social learning theorists believe that because people can learn through observation alone their learning may not necessarily be shown in their performance These are interdependent on each other and its influence can be directly linked with individual or group psychological behavior According to Alex Stajkovic and Fred Luthans it is critically important to recognize that the relative influences exerted by one two or three interacting factors on motivated behavior will vary depending on different activities different individuals and different circumstances

Social cognitive theory is proposed in an agentic perspective which suggests that instead of being just shaped by environments or inner forces individuals are selfdeveloping selfregulating selfreflecting and proactive Specifically human agency operates within three modes

Human agency has four core properties


Evolving over time human beings are featured with advanced neural systems which enable individuals to acquire knowledge and skills by both direct and symbolic terms Four primary capabilities are addressed as important foundations of social cognitive theory symbolizing capability selfregulation capability selfreflective capability and vicarious capability


Social cognitive theory revolves around the process of knowledge acquisition or learning directly correlated to the observation of models The models can be those of an interpersonal imitation or media sources Effective modeling teaches general rules and strategies for dealing with different situations

To illustrate that people learn from watching others Albert Bandura and his colleagues constructed a series of experiments using a Bobo doll In the first experiment children were exposed to either an aggressive or nonaggressive model of either the same sex or opposite sex as the child There was also a control group The aggressive models played with the Bobo doll in an aggressive manner while the nonaggressive models played with other toys They found that children who were exposed to the aggressive models performed more aggressive actions toward the Bobo doll afterward and that boys were more likely to do so than girls

Following that study Albert Bandura tested whether the same was true for models presented through media by constructing an experiment he called Bobo Doll Behavior A Study of Aggression In this experiment Bandura exposed a group of children to a video featuring violent and aggressive actions After the video he then placed the children in a room with a Bobo doll to see how they behaved with it Through this experiment Bandura discovered that children who had watched the violent video subjected the dolls to more aggressive and violent behavior while children not exposed to the video did not This experiment displays the social cognitive theory because it depicts how people reenact behaviors they see in the media In this case the children in this experiment reenacted the model of violence they directly learned from the video

Observations should include

Modeling does not limit to only live demonstrations but also verbal and written behaviour can act as indirect forms of modeling Modeling not only allows students to learn behaviour that they should repeat but also to inhibit certain behaviours For instance if a teacher glares at one student who is talking out of turn other students may suppress this behavior to avoid a similar reaction Teachers model both material objectives and underlying curriculum of virtuous living Teachers should also be dedicated to the building of high selfefficacy levels in their students by recognizing their accomplishments

To learn a particular behavior people must understand what the potential outcome is if they repeat that behavior The observer does not expect the actual rewards or punishments incurred by the model but anticipates similar outcomes when imitating the behavior called outcome expectancies which is why modeling impacts cognition and behavior These expectancies are heavily influenced by the environment that the observer grows up in for example the expected consequences for a DUI in the United States of America are a fine with possible jail time whereas the same charge in another country might lead to the infliction of the death penalty

For example in the case of a student the instructions the teacher provides help students see what outcome a particular behaviour leads to It is the duty of the teacher to teach a student that when a behaviour is successfully learned the outcomes are meaningful and valuable to the students

Social cognitive theory posits that learning most likely occurs if there is a close identification between the observer and the model and if the observer also has a good deal of selfefficacy Selfefficacy is the extent to which an individual believes that they can master a particular skill Selfefficacy beliefs function as an important set of proximal determinants of human motivation affect and actionwhich operate on action through motivational cognitive and affective intervening processes

According to Bandura selfefficacy is the belief in ones capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations Bandura and other researchers have found an individuals selfefficacy plays a major role in how goals tasks and challenges are approached Individuals with high selfefficacy are more likely to believe they can master challenging problems and they can recover quickly from setbacks and disappointments Individuals with low selfefficacy tend to be less confident and dont believe they can perform well which leads them to avoid challenging tasks Therefore selfefficacy plays a central role in behavior performance Observers who have high level of selfefficacy are more likely to adopt observational learning behaviors

Selfefficacy can be developed or increased by

For example students become more effortful active pay attention highly motivated and better learners when they perceive that they have mastered a particular task It is the duty of the teacher to allow student to perceive in their efficacy by providing feedback to understand their level of proficiency Teachers should ensure that the students have the knowledge and strategies they need to complete the tasks

Selfefficacy has also been used to predict behavior in various health related situations such as weight loss quitting smoking and recovery from heart attack In relation to exercise science selfefficacy has produced some of the most consistent results revealing an increase in participation in exercise

Identification allows the observer to feel a onetoone similarity with the model and can thus lead to a higher chance of the observer following through with the modeled action People are more likely to follow behaviors modeled by someone with whom they can identify with The more commonalities or emotional attachments perceived between the observer and the model the more likely the observer learns and reenact the modeled behavior

Social cognitive theory is often applied as a theoretical framework of studies pertained to media representation regarding race gender age and beyond Social cognitive theory suggested heavily repeated images presented in mass media can be potentially processed and encoded by the viewers Bandura 2011 Media content analytic studies examine the substratum of media messages that viewers are exposed to which could provide an opportunity to uncover the social values attached to these media representations Although media contents studies cannot directly test the cognitive process findings can offer an avenue to predict potential media effects from modeling certain contents which provides evidence and guidelines for designing subsequent empirical work

Social cognitive theory is pervasively employed in studies examining attitude or behavior changes triggered by the mass media As Bandura suggested people can learn how to perform behaviors through media modeling SCT has been widely applied in media studies pertained to sports health education and beyond For instance Hardin and Greer in 2009 examined the gendertyping of sports within the theoretical framework of social cognitive theory suggesting that sports media consumption and genderrole socialization significantly related with gender perception of sports in American college students

In health communication social cognitive theory has been applied in research related to smoking quit HIV prevention safe sex behaviors and so on For example Martino Collins Kanouse Elliott and Berry in 2005 examined the relationship between the exposure to televisions sexual content and adolescents sexual behavior through the lens of social cognitive theory confirming the significant relationship between the two variables among white and African American groups however no significant correlation was found between the two variables in the ethic group of Hispanics indicating that peer norm could possibly serve as a mediator of the two examined variables

Millers 2005 study found that choosing the proper gender age and ethnicity for models ensured the success of an AIDS campaign to inner city teenagers This occurred because participants could identify with a recognizable peer have a greater sense of selfefficacy and then imitate the actions to learn the proper preventions and actions
A study by Azza Ahmed in 2009 looked to see if there would be an increase in breastfeeding by mothers of preterm infants when exposed to a breastfeeding educational program guided by SCT Sixty mothers were randomly assigned to either participate in the program or they were given routine care The program consisted of SCT strategies that touched on all three SCT determinants personal  showing models performing breastfeeding correctly to improve selfefficacy behavioral weekly checkins for three months reinforced participants skills environmental  mothers were given an observational checklist to make sure they successfully completed the behavior The author found that mothers exposed to the program showed significant improvement in their breastfeeding skills were more likely to exclusively breastfeed and had fewer problems then the mothers who were not exposed to the educational program

Social cognitive theory emphasizes a large difference between an individuals ability to be morally competent and morally performing Moral competence involves having the ability to perform a moral behavior whereas moral performance indicates actually following ones idea of moral behavior in a specific situation Moral competencies include

As far as an individuals development is concerned moral competence is the growth of cognitivesensory processes simply put being aware of what is considered right and wrong By comparison moral performance is influenced by the possible rewards and incentives to act a certain way For example a persons moral competence might tell them that stealing is wrong and frowned upon by society however if the reward for stealing is a substantial sum their moral performance might indicate a different line of thought Therein lies the core of social cognitive theory

For the most part social cognitive theory remains the same for various cultures Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures as crimes like murder theft and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society there is not much room for people to have different views on what is morally right or wrong The main reason that social cognitive theory applies to all nations is because it does not say what is moral and immoral it simply states that we can acknowledge these two concepts Our actions in reallife scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating our morals is significant enough and nothing else

In series TV programming according to social cognitive theory the awarded behaviors of liked characters are supposed to be followed by viewers while punished behaviors are supposed to be avoided by media consumers However in most cases protagonists in TV shows are less likely to experience the longterm suffering and negative consequences caused by their risky behaviors which could potentially undermine the punishments conveyed by the media leading to a modeling of the risky behaviors Nabi and Clark conducted experiments about individuals attitudes and intentions consuming various portrayals of onenight stand sex unsafe and risky sexual behavior finding that individuals who had not previously experience one night stand sex consuming media portrayals of this behavior could significantly increase their expectations of having an one night stand sex in the future although negative outcomes were represented in TV shows

4533
4533 is a composition by American rock band LCD Soundsystem released digitally on October 17 2006 Commissioned by Nike New Yorkbased creative lifestyle marketing and public relations agency Cornerstone helped the musical efforts and coordinated the track The original work was initially available exclusively at Nike Music Store on iTunes A fulllength album rerelease with three bonus tracks was issued by DFA Records on CD and vinyl on November 12 2007 An eight track remix CD entitled  was released September 2009 4533 was rereleased as a limited edition whitelabel vinyl on May 26 2015

The composition was recorded between July and September 2006 at DFA Studios in New York City The publicity for 4533 described it as being designed to accompany jogging workouts to reward and push at good intervals of a run An early statement detailed that the composition had been refined after several runs on the treadmill James Murphy later admitted that this was entirely a lie on his part and that he does not actually jog He stated that he wanted to make a longform record like E2E4 by Manuel Gttsching and used the opportunity provided by Nike to do so The artwork of 4533 also resembles that of Gttschings work

Parts of 4533 were later used on the album Sound of Silver in particular the track Someone Great which appears on 4533 as an instrumental section later distinguished as track 3 The complete track was also released for registered Nike users in late March 2007 as a gift of appreciation when Nike logged its 10 millionth mile The composition was available to be sold by Nike via iTunes for six months

Although the composition is titled 4533 a reference to the two most common speeds in RPM of vinyl records the actual length is slightly longer

For the last series of concerts at Terminal 5 and Madison Square Garden LCD Soundsystem performed 4533 in full during the second set Part 3 was saved until the performance of Someone Great In the place of Part 3 LCD Soundsystem performed Sound of Silver

DFA Records announced that 4533 would be rereleased on November 12 2007 It was made available on CD and vinyl through DFA and EMI The rerelease featured three bonus tracks Freak OutStarry Eyes James Murphy and Eric Brouceks dub remix of North American Scum and Hippie Priest Bumout all of which were Bsides from European versions of Sound of Silver singles These three tracks would also be made available together separately on the Confuse the Marketplace EP released on December 11 2007

4533 received critical acclaim On the review aggregator website Metacritic which assigns a weighted average out of 100 points the album received an average critic score of 86 based on 25 reviews indicating universal acclaim Manuel Gttsching was however critical of the composition despite it being inspired by his own work stating Musically there is nothing related to E2E4  its just a megamix of his work

Type 89 IGo medium tank
The was a medium tank used by the Imperial Japanese Army from 1932 to 1942 in combat operations of the Second SinoJapanese War at Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union and in the Second World War The Type 89B model was the worlds first massproduced diesel engine tank The tank was armed with a shortbarrel 57 mm cannon for knocking out pillboxes and masonry fortifications and proved effective in campaigns in Manchuria and China as the Chinese National Revolutionary Army had only three tank battalions to oppose them which consisted primarily of Vickers export models German Panzer Is and Italian CV33 tankettes The Type 89 was a 1920s design medium tank built to support the infantry and thus lacked the armor or armament of 1940s generation Allied armor it was regarded as obsolete by the time of the 1939 battles of Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union The code designation IGo comes from the katakana letter  for first and the kanji  for number The designation is also transliterated ChiRo and sometimes YiGo
The Type 89 evolved from Japans first domestic tank project initiated by the Imperial Japanese Armys Osaka Technical Arsenal in 1925 The original plan was for two types of tanks to be created A light tank at 10ton based on the French Renault FT tank and a 20ton design modeled after the Vickers Medium tank By February 1927 the Type 87 ChiI medium tank was ready for trials However it was 20ton and underpowered The weight of the initial prototype and its low speed did not impress the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and a new requirement was issued for a lighter tank with a nominal weight The new design was modeled after the Vickers Medium C which had been bought by the Japanese Army in March 1927

By April 1928 the new light tank design was finished The prototype of the was completed in 1929 and designated as the Type 89 Later the Type 89 was reclassified as a medium tank because the weight increased to over 10 tons due to several improvements As the armys Sagami Arsenal lacked the capacity for mass production a contract was awarded to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries which built a new tank factory to specifically produce this model Production of the Type 89 began in 1931 and it soon became the main battle tank of the Japanese Army

Although the Type 89 was well regarded by the army there were several small problems to be rectified notably a gap under the mantlet on early models that allowed rifle fire to enter the turret Work continued on improving the Type 89 after the production started and as a result variants were developed

The Type 89 required a crew of four commandergunner loader driver and hull gunner

The design of the Type 89 was relatively conventional with a forwardmounted gun turret carrying the main armament a Type 90 57 mm gun that was complemented by two Type 91 65 mm machine guns One was located in the front hull and the other placed in a turret ball mount pointed towards the rear a practice followed with most Japanese tanks The Type 90 57mm tank gun had a barrel length of L149 el angle of fire of 15 to 20 degrees AZ angle of fire of 20 degrees muzzle velocity of  and could penetrate of 20mm of armor at 500 m 08in550yd

Rather than using soft iron armor as on the earlier ChiI the designers chose to use steel plate armor developed by the Nihon Seikosho Company JSW The type of armor was referred to as Niseko steel an abbreviation of Nihonseikosho

The Type 89 was driven through the rear drive sprocket and featured nine bogies mounted in pairs on each side with the forward bogie on an independent suspension Five smaller return wheels were mounted along a steel girder The Type A could only communicate with signal flags Some vehicles were provided with two searchlights for night operations Later the Type 94 Mk 4 Hei 1934 model radio communication device with range of 06 miles and weight of 198lb linked with a radio antenna of in a reverse L shape was installed


The Type 89 served with Japanese infantry divisions and first saw combat use during the First Battle of Shanghai in 1932 The shortbarreled 57mm gun was effective at destroying machine gun nests and its armor although thin was enough to stop small arms fire The relatively low speed of was not an issue in these types of operations

The following year the Japanese Army formed its first independent armor force by creating three regiments armed with the Type 89 each consisting of two companies with ten tanks each Three more regiments were formed in 1934 It was deployed for infantry support operations in the Second SinoJapanese War and in various campaigns throughout China after 1937 After the outbreak of war with China the peacetime budgetary limitations were removed and the more capable and expensive Mitsubishi ChiHa model was accepted as the new Type 97 medium tank by the army to replace the Type 89 Type 89s were the main medium tank of the Japanese military through 1937

On the evening of 2 July 1939 during the battle of Khalkhin Gol the Japanese Armys 1st Tank Corps commanded by Lt General Yasuoka Masaomi launched an offensive against the Soviet Unions 11th Tank and 7th Armored brigades The 1st Tank Corps consisted of the 3rd Tank Regiment and 4th Tank Regiment of which the 3rd regiment consisted of 26 Type 89s four Type 97 medium tanks seven Type 94 tankettes and four Type 97 tankettes and the 4th regiment contained 35 Type 95s eight Type 89s and three Type 94 tankettes respectively In this battle the Type 97 medium tank was a newly fielded machine and was primarily reserved for home units as well as transitioning into Japanese Army forces stationed in China Manchuria

The 3rd Tank Regiment had after charging through Soviet artillery barrages successfully overrun the Soviet motorized infantry and taken the high ground which had been quickly abandoned by the Soviets However by 2100 hours Soviet counter battery fire had begun pounding the newly taken position and the 3rd Tank repositioned themselves behind the objective

The 4th Tank Regiment which had become separated from the 3rd Tank Regiment advanced upon an objective under the cover of a thunderstorm that masked their movements but exposed the Soviet positions The 4th Tank Regiment continued to advance when suddenly a shift in the lightning flashes illuminated the advancing Japanese tanks whereupon the Soviets immediately opened fire with antitank guns heavy machine guns and artillery However the range was so close that the Soviet artillery could not depress their guns far enough and the 4th Tank Regiment was ordered to charge at about 0020 hours 1220 AM Soviet shells passed wildly over the charging tanks as they penetrated over a thousand yards into the Soviet lines Now isolated and deep within the Soviet lines the 4th Tank Regiment moved several thousands yards where they met up with Japanese infantry

The 4th Tank Regiment had expended 1100 37mm and 129 57mm tank shells during the fight as well as about 16000 machine gun rounds Of the approximate 73 light and medium Japanese tanks from both regiments committed to the offensive 13 were damaged beyond repair by Soviet gunfire about 14 others were repaired after major overhauls and 17 tanks were repaired in the field

Soviet forces concluded that the 1st Tank Corps had penetrated the defenses of their 9th Armored Brigade and 149th Infantry Regiment and had reached Soviet artillery positions

By 1942 the Type 89 was gradually being withdrawn from frontline combat service but many units saw action in the Battle of the Philippines Battle of Malaya and Burma campaign and continued to be used in China They were also often used in static defense positions in the Japaneseoccupied islands of the Netherlands East Indies and in the South Pacific Mandate but with their weak armor and low muzzle velocity main gun they were a poor match for the American M4 Sherman

During the early stages of the First Indochina War France set up an ad hoc unit of French and Japanese armour called the Commando Blind du Cambodge from tanks left over from the Japanese invasion of French Indochina This unit included one Type 89B tank

Atalanti Island
Atalanti  or Atalantonisi  or Talandonsi  is a small uninhabited island in the North Euboean Gulf about 600 m off the coast near the town Atalanti Phthiotis Greece There are several small islets next to Atalanti island including the islet of Agios Nikolaos

Anciently the island was known as Atalanta or Atalante  It was noted by ancient geographers and historians as a small island off Locris in the Opuntian Gulf said to have been torn asunder from the mainland by an earthquake In the first year of the Peloponnesian War this previously uninhabited island was fortified by the Athenians to prevent Locrian pirates attacking Euboea In the sixth year of the war a part of the Athenian works was destroyed by the sea with half the ships on the beach destroyed Thucydides reports that following an earthquake the sea receded from the shore before returning in a huge wave Citing similar events at Peparethus and Orobiae he suggests that earthquakes and such sea events are linkedwe now know that such tsunami are in fact caused by earthquakes In 421BCE the Peace of Nicias returned Atalanta to Sparta Aside from Thucydides the island is noted by Strabo Diodorus Pausanias Livy Pliny the Elder Seneca and Stephanus of Byzantium

Soul Enterprise
The Soul Enterprise is often described as more of a fraternity than a band per se It was founded in 1990 by vocalist Bob Manning from the USA with other American musicians based in Sweden such as JairRohm Parker Wells and Bill Bryant It featured the sounds of oldschool Soul music with a blend of jazz improvisation

In the beginning years the groups founding members were busy freelancing for other acts besides the Soul Enterprise such as Dr Alban and Jennifer Brown A period of instability followed with many different substitute musicians playing in the band The group went through major reforms and a complete change of members followed under the leadership of guitarist Zak Keith in 1992 The new lineup of firstcall musicians included some of Stockholms best many considered to be worldclass musicians such as Morgan gren drums Anders Johnsson bass Micke Wennergrund drums Lasse Pollack keyboards Magnus Lindgren Saxophone Micke Srensen trumpet Mia Gejrot Anna SandbergHll and Tonja Hedtjrn voc Magnus Lindgren went on to play with Herbie Hancock at age 18 Micke Srensen went on to work with former Supremes member Mary Wilson Lasse Pollack toured with Glenn Hughes in Japan

The Soul Enterprise was voted best Soul band of Scandinavia by Fasching Jazz Club in 1998 Dagens Nyheter a major Swedish newspaper credited Bob Manning and the Soul Enterprise as a major influence in keeping Soul music alive in Scandinavia Its musicians work as sessionists and have appeared on numerous records together and individually

Alkaline tide
Alkaline tide refers to a condition normally encountered after eating a meal where during the production of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells in the stomach the parietal cells secrete bicarbonate ions across their basolateral membranes and into the blood causing a temporary increase in pH

During hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach the gastric parietal cells extract chloride anions carbon dioxide water and sodium cations from the blood plasma and in turn release bicarbonate back into the plasma after forming it from carbon dioxide and water constituents This is to maintain the plasmas electrical balance as the chloride anions have been extracted The bicarbonate content causes the venous blood leaving the stomach to be more alkaline than the arterial blood delivered to it

The alkaline tide is neutralised by a secretion of Hinto the blood during HCO secretion in the pancreas

Postprandial ie after a meal alkaline tide lasts until the acids in food absorbed in the small intestine reunite with the bicarbonate that was produced when the food was in the stomach Thus alkaline tide is selflimited and normally lasts less than two hours

Postprandial alkaline tide has also been shown to be a causative agent of calcium oxalate urinary stones in cats and potentially in other species

A more pronounced alkaline tide results from vomiting which stimulates hyperactivity of gastric parietal cells to replace lost stomach acid Thus protracted vomiting can result in metabolic alkalosis

<doc id="7716173" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716173" title="NMR tube">
NMR tube
An NMR tube is a thin glass walled tube used to contain samples in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Typically NMR tubes come in 5mm diameters but 10mm and 3mm samples are known It is important that the tubes are uniformly thick and wellbalanced to ensure that NMR tube spins at a regular rate ie they do not wobble usually about 20Hz in the NMR spectrometer

NMR tubes are typically made of borosilicate glass They are available in seven and eight inch lengths a 5mm tube outer diameter is most common but 3mm and 10mm outer diameters are available as well Where boron NMR is desired quartz NMR tubes containing low concentrations of boron as opposed to borosilicate glass are available Specialized closures such as J Young valves and screwcap closures are available aside from more common polyethylene caps

Two common specifications for NMR tubes are concentricity and camber Concentricity refers to the variation in the radial centers measured at the inner and outer walls Camber refers to the straightness of the tube Poor values for either may cause poorer quality spectra by reducing the homogeneity of the sample In particular an NMR tube which has poor camber may wobble when rotated giving rise to spinning side bands With modern manufacturing techniques even cheap tubes give good spectra for routine applications

Usually only a small sample is dissolved in an appropriate solvent For H NMR experiments this will usually be a deuterated solvent such as CDCl Sufficient solvent should be used in order to fill the tube by 45cm depending on the spectrometer Protein NMR is usually performed in a 90 HO or buffer10 DO mixture

The sample may be sonicated or agitated to aid dissolution and solids are removed via filtering through a plug of celite in a Pasteur pipette directly into the NMR tube

The NMR tube is then usually sealed with a polyethylene cap but can be flame sealed or sealed with a Teflon Schlenk tap or even a very small rubber septum Parafilm may be wrapped around the cap to reduce solvent evaporation

A Shigemi tube is a microscale NMR tube used with an ordinarysize NMR tube Shigemi tubes may be appropriate for protein NMR experiments where only a smaller sample is available A corresponding smaller solvent volume is desired to maintain a higher sample concentration The reduced sample depth is compensated for by solid glass on the NMR tube beneath the level of sample which varies for the make of spectrometer Once air bubbles have been expelled the plunger is secured to the tube proper by parafilm Ideally the tubes are matched with the deuterated solvent used to have better spectrum resolution

NMR tubes are hard to clean because of their small bore They are cleaned best before the sample has dried

Cleaning is performed usually by rinsing with the same nondeuterated solvent used to dissolve the initial sample Dichloromethane or acetone are good choices because dichloromethane is similar in polarity to chloroform a common NMR solvent while acetone dissolves many organic compounds Sonication and scrubbing with a pipe cleaner may be helpful in removing traces of solid contaminants If necessary the tube may be filled with an oxidizing solution of aqua regia or piranha solution HOHSO Care should be taken with these solutions as they can unexpectedly and violently erupt from the NMR tube due to pressure buildup aque regia or explosion piranha Chromic acid solutions are never used due to traces of paramagnetic chromium left behind on the tubes causing interference with NMR experiments

When the NMR tube is determined to be clean it is triplerinsed with distilled water acetone and left to airdry or dry in an oven at hightemperature It is best not to exceed 60C At higher temperatures slight tube distortion can occur which will affect tube camber If NMR tubes are washed a final rinse is recommended with a solvent that easily evaporates at 60C and that has no residue

A better alternative to the use of potentially hazardous oxidizers is an NMR tube cleaner right It is an apparatus which uses a vacuum to flush solvent andor a detergent solution through the entire length of the NMR tube

In this apparatus the NMR tube 1 with the cap 3 fixed to the base of the NMR tube is placed upside down on the apparatus The NMR tube fits over an inner tube 5 linked to the solvent reservoir 6 The NMR cap rests on the outer tube of the apparatus 4 A vacuum is applied usually via a water aspirator via the vacuum inlet The NMR tube cap forms a vacuum seal Solvent 7 is drawn from the solvent reservoir 6 and is forced to the base of the NMR tube and flushes the NMR tube out 9 with solvent cleaning it Note to complete the vacuum a flask is attached to the NMR tube cleaning apparatus

This sort of apparatus is commercially available though it is costly and easy to destroy by shattering or breaking off the cleaning tube Equivalent designs may be assembled from ordinary labware as well

Day of the Tiles
The Day of the Tiles  was an event that took place in the French town of Grenoble on 7 June in 1788 It was one of the first disturbances which preceded the French Revolution and is credited by a few historians as its start

Grenoble was the scene of popular unrest due to financial hardship from the economic crises The causes of the French Revolution affected all of France but matters came to a head first in Grenoble

Unrest in the parlementary town was sparked by the attempts of Cardinal tienne Charles de Lomnie de Brienne the Archbishop of Toulouse and ControllerGeneral of Louis XVI to abolish the Parlements to work around their refusal to enact a new tax to deal with Frances unmanageable public debt

Tensions that had been rising in urban populations due to poor harvests and the high cost of bread were exacerbated by the refusal of the privileged classes  the Church and the aristocracy who insisted on retaining the right to collect feudal and seignorial royalties from their peasants and landholders  to relinquish any of their fiscal privileges This blocked the reforms of the kings minister Charles Alexandre de Calonne and the Assembly of Notables of January 1787 Added to this Brienne appointed as the kings ControllerGeneral of Finance on 8 April 1787 was widely regarded as being a manager without experience or imagination

Shortly before 7 June 1788 in a large meeting at Grenoble those who attended the meeting decided to call together the old Estates of the province of Dauphin The government responded by sending troops to the area to put down the movement

At roughly 10 in the morning of Saturday 7 June merchants closed down their shops as groups of 300 to 400 men and women formed armed with stones sticks axes bars They rushed to the city gates to prevent the departure of judges who took part in the Grenoble meeting Some rioters attempted to cross the Isre but faced a picket of 50 soldiers at the St Lawrence bridge while others headed to the Rue Neuve
The cathedrals bells were seized by French peasants at noon The crowd swiftly grew as the bells provoked the influx of neighbouring peasants to creep in the city climbing the walls using boats on the Isere and for some pushing open the city gates

Other insurgents boarded the ramparts and rushed to the hotel Lhtel de la Premire prsidence the Duke of ClermontTonnerre was staying in at the time The Duke had two elite regiments in Grenoble the Regiment of the Royal Navy Rgiment RoyalLaMarine whose colonel was Marquis dAmbert and the regiment of Austrasia Rgiment dAustrasie which was commanded by Colonel Count Chabord The Royal Navy was the first to respond to the growing crowds and was given the order to quell the rioting without the use of arms However as the mob stormed the hotel entrance the situation escalated Soldiers sent to quell the disturbances forced the townspeople off the streets Some sources say that the soldiers were sent to disperse parliamentarians who were attempting to assemble a parliament During an attack Royal Navy soldiers injured a 75yearold man with a bayonet At the sight of blood the people became angry and started to tear up the streets Townspeople climbed onto the roofs of buildings around the Jesuit College to hurl down a rain of rooftiles on the soldiers in the streets below hence the episodes name Many soldiers took refuge in a building to shoot through the windows while the crowd continued to rush inside and ravage everything

A noncommissioned officer of the Royal Navy commanding a patrol of four soldiers gave the order to open fire into the mob One civilian was killed and a boy of 12 wounded To the east of the city the Royal Navy soldiers were forced to open fire in order to protect the citys arsenal fearing that the rioters would seize the weapons and ammunition Meanwhile Colonel Count Chabord began deploying the regiment of Austrasia to aid and relieve the Royal Navy soldiers

Three of the citys four consults gathered at the City Hall and attempted to reason with the crowd However their words were silenced amidst the clamour of the mob Through great difficulty the consults made their way through the crowds and eventually took refuge with the officers of the local garrison Later that evening the Duke of ClermontTonnerre withdrew his troops from the streets and hotel to prevent further violence from escalating the situation The Duke managed to narrowly escape the hotel before the crowd completely looted the inside With control of the hotel lost the Royal Navy troops were ordered to return to their quarters

At six a crowd estimated at ten thousand people shouting Long live the parliament forced the judges to return to the Palace of the Parliament of Dauphin Palais du Parlement du Dauphin by flooding them with flowers Throughout the night carillons sounded triumphantly a large bonfire crackled on SaintAndr square surrounded by a crowd that danced and sang Long live forever our parliament May God preserve the King and the devil take Brienne and Lamoignon

On 10 June the local commander attempted to appease the spirits of the crowd with no success Under the orders of exile pronounced against them by the King the parliamentarians were forced to flee from Grenoble in the morning of 12 June It wasnt until the 14th of July that order was fully restored in the city by Marshal Vaux who replaced the Duke of ClermontTonnerre

The commander of the troops found the situation so alarming that he agreed to allow the meeting of the Estates to proceed but not in the capital A meeting was therefore arranged for the 21 July 1788 at the nearby village of Vizille This meeting became known as the Assembly of Vizille

In all six outbreaks of rioting have been identified in the city on 7 June

The event was commemorated by Alexandre Debelles The Day of the Tiles 13 July 1788 painted in 1889 He painted it a century after the event and got the date wrong but it undoubtedly attempts to depict the events described by the title

The meeting of the three Estates which had been agreed to took place at Vizille on 21 July Several hundred people assembled representing the three Estates the nobility the clergy and the middle class the bourgeoisie who were granted double representation The meeting was led by a moderate reformist lawyer Jean Joseph Mounier and passed resolutions

These demands were accepted by the King Brienne left office during August 1788 but before doing so issued a decree convoking the EstatesGeneral for 1 May 1789 It is not clear whether this decree was prompted by the demands from the Assembly of Vizille or the Day of the Tiles because at least one source puts the date of the decree at 7 July 1788 after the Day of the Tiles but two weeks before the Assembly of Vizille

Since 1984 the Chteau de Vizille houses the Muse de la Rvolution franaise

Some historians such as Jonathan Sperber have used the Day of the Tiles to demonstrate the worsening situation in France in the buildup to the French Revolution of 1789 Others have even credited it with being the beginning of the revolution itself The events as related by R M Johnston provide an apparently clear link between the Day of the Tiles the Assembly of Vizille and the start of the revolution proper

Development of the Type 4 ChiTo began in 1943 as an intended successor to the Type 97Kai Shinhoto ChiHa The Army Technical Bureau had been working on the Type 4 ChiTo as the counter to the M4 Sherman but there were problems and delays in the program As a result a stopgap tank was required The Type 3 ChiNu medium tank was developed to cope with the M4 Sherman Finally the first prototype Type 4 ChiTo was delivered in 1944 Similar in appearance but significantly larger than the Type 97 it was the most advanced Japanese tank to reach the production stage

Intended Type 4 ChiTo output was 25 tanks per month with 20 to be made at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and 5 to be produced at Kobe Seikosho Late war shortageinduced delays caused by the severing of supply lines with conquered territories and US strategic bombing of the Japanese mainland resulted in a total of six chassis being built According to The National Institute for Defense Studies Ministry of Defense Military Administration of Munitions Mobilization Production Chart of January to April of 1945 the plan was to produce a total of 6 Type 4 ChiTo tanks in the first three months of 1945 Two Type 4 ChiTo tanks are known to have been completed in 1945 and neither saw combat

Another 105mm SP gun planned was the KaTo or KaTo Sha 105mm SP AT Gun KaTos development was ordered in 1943 The engine placement was forward while the gun placement was in the rear section of the hull The open top superstructure was based on the Type 5 NaTo Two main guns for the KaTo were completed in 1945 According to several sources the KaTo hull was based on the Type 4 ChiTo which needed to be extended in length to accommodate the main gun An extra road wheel was added to each side of the chassis However according to another source the incomplete KaTo hull was based on the Type 5 ChiRi medium tank

Jean Mercier
Jean Mercier 19011971 a Frenchman was known as the father of the bladdertype hydraulic accumulator Mercier fled France for the United States during the Nazi invasion eventually settling in New York City After meeting Edward M Greer in 1940 the two founded Greer Hydraulics in 1942 to produce aircraft hydraulic components

In 1943 Jean Mercier recognized an opportunity for his bladder type accumulators in Hamilton Standards hydromatic propellers They needed a device that would fit inside the dome of their propeller and have the ability to store sufficient hydraulic fluid to feather the propeller on an engine failure that might be experienced in combat It also had to be able to function at temperatures from 40F to 180F There was a single insurmountable problemweight which was a problem since World War II aircraft were quite small The use of a gasoil separator today called a bladder solved the problem

Greer and Mercier formed a patent company GreerOlaer and Greer Hydraulics became the sole licensee with the rights to continue development and to license other companies outside the US From the early 1950s bladdertype accumulators became the unit that was specified and used in almost every application where hydraulics was employed  machine tools plastic machinery circuit breakers rock crushers oil drilling farm and road machinery to name a few

Greer Hydraulics was later acquired by ParkerHannifin of Cleveland Ohio

Mercier was awarded the Franklin Institutes Certificate of Merit in 1951 He was also decorated Chevalier de la Legion dhonneur by the French Republic

Panthir  Panther was an which served in the Hellenic Royal Navy from 19121946

The ship along with her three sister ships  and  had originally been ordered by Argentina from the English shipyard Cammell Laird in Birkenhead Panthir was originally named Santiago del Estero They were purchased in 1912 by Greece ready for delivery each for the sum of 148000 when the Balkan Wars seemed likely Accepted by Captain Ath Miaoulis RHN in Palermo Sicily where she arrived manned by a foreign crew

During the Balkan Wars the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition 3000 rounds of torpedoes Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship and for this reason these ships were initially named scouts rather than destroyers

During World War I Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and due to Greeces neutrality the four Aetosclass ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916 taken over by the French in November and served in the French Navy from 191718 By 1918 they were back on escort duty under Greek colors mainly in the Aegean Sea

Colombian weasel
Colombian weasel Mustela felipei also known as the Don Felipes weasel is a very rare species of weasel only known with certainty from the departments of Huila and Cauca in Colombia and nearby northern Ecuador where only known from a single specimen Both its scientific and alternative common name honours the mammalogist Philip Don Felipe Hershkovitz

It appears to be largely restricted to riparian habitats at an altitude of  There is extensive deforestation within its limited distribution within the northern Andes of Colombia and Ecuador and with less than ten known specimens it is probably the rarest carnivoran in South America It is considered vulnerable by the IUCN

It is the second smallest living carnivore on average being only slightly larger than the least weasel Mustela nivalis and slightly smaller than the ermine or stoat M erminea The upperparts and tail are blackishbrown while the underparts are orangebuff

M felipei has an elongated body with an average length of  and a tail long Weight ranges between  M felipei has a dark dorsal color with no variation ventrally the weasel has a light orange color with gradual fading of color up to the head Hair color from the tail to the nose is uniform with no striping or spotting M felipei has an inflated auditory bulla located near the dorsal midline on the body along with a wide mesopterygoid fossa The soles of the feet lack any fur and extensive webbing is located on the second third and fourth digits suggesting a semiaquatic lifestyle

M felipei is one of the least studied carnivore species in the Americas and is expected to maintain a larger geographical range that currently known Reports of sightings have placed M felipei in the mountain ranges of western Colombia to northern Ecuador M felipei was originally thought to be endemic to Colombia however recent specimens have been collected in Ecuador that have since proven this thought wrong Distribution and habitat modeling surveys have been able to predict that M felipei is distributed between 20 protected areas in Colombia and 14 in Ecuador along with three previously known locations in both countries the majority of these locations lie in protected areas of the forest

From geographic modeling and collected specimens it has been concluded that Mustela felipei lives in largely riparian habitats primarily staying close to rivers streams and along the shorelines of other natural water sources Since this habitat lies in an elevation range of it is classified as being in a cloud forest consisting of 100 humidity adding to the riparian habitat

M felipei is a carnivorous mammal that preys primarily on fish other small aquatic animals and small terrestrial mammals Hunting is aided by the use of webbed feet and camouflaged fur

Mustela felipei has been recognized by the IUCN as being vulnerable and having a decreasing population However due to rarity of sighting and deforestation of known habitat it remains unclear as to the true numbers of individuals that make up the population

Ameny Qemau
Ameny Qemau was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty during the Second Intermediate Period According to Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker he was the 5th king of the dynasty reigning for 2 years over most of Egypt except perhaps the eastern Nile Delta from 1793 BC until 1791 BC

The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt notes that Ameny Qemaus name is essentially a filiative nomen that is a name specifying the filiation of its holder Indeed Ameny Qemau could be read as Amenys son Qemau Ryholt concludes that the Ameny in question was Qemaus predecessor Sekhemkare Amenemhat V and that Qemau was his son This opinion is shared by Egyptologist Darrell Baker but not by Jrgen von Beckerath who left Ameny Qemaus position within the 13th Dynasty undetermined in his handbook of Egyptian pharaohs The successor of Ameny Qemau Qemau Siharnedjheritef may have been his son as Qemau Siharnedjheritef may be read The son of Qemau Horus protects his father

Beyond his pyramid in Dahshur Ameny Qemau is a poorly attested king his name does not appear on the Turin canon and the only contemporary attestations of him are fragments of four inscribed canopic jars found in the pyramid An additional plaquette of unknown provenance bears his name but may be a modern forgery
Ameny Qemaus identity is therefore uncertain and attempts have been made to identify him with better attested kings of the period in particular with Sehotepibre who appears on the Turin canon after Amenemhat V Ryholt however believes that Qemaus name was lost in a wsf lacuna of the Turin canon located just before Amenemhat V A wsf literally missing lacuna denotes a lacuna in the original document from which the canon was copied in Ramesside times

Ameny Qemau had a pyramid built for himself in the south of Dahshur The pyramid was discovered in 1957 by Charles Muss and only investigated in 1968 It originally measured 50 square meters at its base and stood 35 meters high but is now completely ruined due to stone robbing The substructures have also been extensively damaged The burial chamber of the king was made of a single large block of quartzite similar to those found in the pyramid of Amenemhat III at Hawara and the Mazghuna pyramids The block was hewn to receive the sarcophagus and canopic jars of the king but only fragments of these and unidentified bones where found onsite

Additionally the name of Ameny Qemau is believed to appear on an inscribed block which was found in a newlydiscovered pyramid at Dahshur whose existence was announced in April 2017 Many Egyptologists such as James P Allen Aidan Dodson and Thomas Schneider agrees that the royal name on the block is that of Ameny Qemau Dodson further speculated that given the relatively poor quality of the inscription and the oddity for a pharaoh to be the owner of two pyramids the newlydiscovered one may have originally belonged to one of Qemaus predecessors and that he may have usurped the structure by chiseling out the royal names on the block and superimposing his own cartouches on it Among the artifacts found in the burial chamber were a sarcophagus canopic jars and boxes of wrappings Inscriptions on the boxes mention one of the daughters of Ameny Qemau Hatshepsut suggesting that the pyramid may have been usurped for his daughter and may explain why he has two pyramids

Poem for Rent
Poem for Rent is a nonprofit project for arts distribution founded in Israel Poems on bulletin boards are posted in the same format as standard house for rent posts with several detachable tearoffs on the bottom Instead of a telephone number quotes from the poem are written on the tearoffs This way anyone who passes by can read the poem and pick a tearoff with a quote they liked from the poem

The first poems for rent were posted in Israel during October 2005 One of those was documented in the Hebrew creation site Tzura  Those were poems of famous Israeli poets such as Yehuda Amichai and Nathan Zach as well as poems of the Polish poet Nobel Prize winner Wislawa Szymborska

In 2006 the concept expanded to other types of arts such as painting for rent and comics for rent The project has also expanded geographically poems for rent have appeared in Switzerland and The Netherlands In its summer 2006 issue the Dutch poetry magazine Awater dedicated an article to the project titled Wat Bezielt What Inspires

Richard D Gill
Richard David Gill born 11 September 1951 is a mathematician born in the United Kingdom who has lived in the Netherlands since 1974 As a probability theorist and statistician Gill is most well known for his research on counting processes and survival analysis some of which has appeared in an advanced textbook He is the chair of mathematical statistics at Leiden University Gill is also known for his pro bono consulting and advocacy on behalf of victims of incompetent statistical testimony including a Dutch nurse who was wrongfully convicted and jailed for six years

He studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge 19701973 and subsequently followed the Diploma of Statistics course there 19731974

Marrying a Dutch woman he moved to the Netherlands where he worked from 1974 to 1988 at the Mathematical Centre later renamed Centrum Wiskunde  Informatica or CWI of Amsterdam In 1979 Gill obtained his PhD with the thesis Censoring and Stochastic Integrals which was supervised by Jacobus Oosterhoff of the Vrije Universiteit which awarded the doctorate Gill spent Autumn 1980 at the Statistical Research Unit at the University of Copenhagen Gill continued to collaborate with Danish and Norwegian statisticians for ten years helping to write the book Statistical models based on counting processes which is often referred to as ABGK for the authors Andersen Borgan Gill and Keiding In 1983 he became the head of the Department of Mathematical Statistics at CWI

In 1988 he moved to the Department of Mathematics of Utrecht University Gill became the chair in mathematical stochasticsthis chair represented the three mathematical sciences of mathematical statistics probability theory and operations research His PhD students include Sara van de Geer and Mark vanderLaan

In 2006 he moved to the Department of Mathematics at Leiden University where he became the chair of mathematical statistics Since then he has conducted statistical research in the theory of quantum information and in biostatistics He has also worked on survival analysis semiparametric models causality missing data machine learning and statistics in image analysis Gill also publishes on the foundations of several mathematical sciences the foundations of statistics of probability of mathematics and of quantum physics

In recent years he has lobbied for retrials for Lucia de Berk and Kevin Sweeney The nurse Lucia de Berk was sentenced to life imprisonment after a legal psychologist gave testimony that there was great likelihood that de Berk committed a string of murdersThe court was told by Dr Henk Elffers of the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement that more children had died on her shifts than appeared possible by chance He put the odds of her presence being a mere coincidence at one in 342 million a figure that seemed to have blinded the court to any alternative explanation of the deathsThis statistical testimony was shown to be fallacious by professional statisticians notably Gill Continued scrutiny showed that the data had also been collected to support the prosecutors conviction of Berk which further invalidated the pseudostatistical testimony

The conduct of the case in Professor Gills account was extraordinary Convinced she was guilty the police and the managers of the Juliana Childrens Hospital assembled a dossier in which it seemed every death became unnatural when it had occurred during or after a shift in which she had worked For one of the alleged murders it was established on appeal she had not even been in the hospital for three days around the time it occurred Using more appropriate statistical methods reduced the odds from one in342million to one in48 A further analysis by Professor Gill further reduces the odds to one in nine

Professor Gill helped in the campaign to have a new trial Consequently a retrial was ordered and de Berk was found not guilty and received a public apology from the Dutch government along with financial compensation amount unknown for her six years of incarceration

Richard Gill is a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences He is a past president of The Netherlands Society for Statistics and Operations Research which publishes the journal Statistica Neerlandica Gill was selected as the 20102011 Distinguished Lorentz Fellow by the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in Humanities and Social Sciences

Founded in 1998 the club started out as Canon ENM Coached by Allan Dorbek the team joined toptier Korvpalli Meistriliiga KML for the 199899 season The clubs first season was a disappointment as the team finished in last place without winning a single game In 1999 the team was renamed Ehitustriist The teams results improved slowly as Ehitustriist finished the league in 7th place for four consecutive seasons In 2003 the club merged with Audentes and became EhitustriistAudentes while the former Estonia national team coach Maarten van Gent was hired as head coach The team finished the 200304 season in 5th place After the season EhitustriistAudentes dissolved and both clubs continued separately

In 2004 Ehitustriist moved to the new 7200seat Saku Suurhall The team finished the 200405 regular season with a 124 record and dominant in the playoffs In the finals they faced University of Tartu Ehitustriist won the series and the teams first Estonian Championship 4 games to 3 Howard Frier was named Most Valuable Player of the season The team also competed in the regional Baltic Basketball League for the first time finishing in 7th place with an 810 record

Coming off their first Estonian Championship Ehitustriist leased the trademark Kalev from AS Kalev and became BC KalevCramo Allan Dorbek was replaced as head coach by former Estonia national team shooting guard Aivar Kuusmaa for the 200506 season On 2 October 2005 the team won their first Estonian Cup defeating University of Tartu 7064 in the final KalevCramo also made their debut in Europe entering the 200506 season of the FIBA EuroCup but failed to advance past the group stage with just one victory in 6 games In the KML KalevCramo finished the regular season in first place with a 213 record and reached the finals in the playoffs The team defended their title defeating University of Tartu 4 games to 3 winning the deciding seventh game 6968 James Williams was named Finals MVP and Kuusmaa won the Coach of the Year award Despite that Kuusmaa was replaced by Veselin Mati for the 200607 season

The team won their second Estonian Cup in 2006 but was unable to defend the title KalevCramo reached the finals but lost the series 24 to University of Tartu Despite losing in the finals Valmo Kriisa won the Estonian Player of the Year award while Travis Reed was named KML and BBL MVP and Mati won the Coach of the Year award KalevCramo saw limited success in Europe reaching the second round in the 200607 FIBA EuroCup and competing in the European second tier 200708 ULEB Cup but a record of 37 wasnt enough to advance past the group stage The team won another Estonian Cup in 2007 and reached the finals in the 200708 season but were swept by University of Tartu

In 2008 New Zealand national team coach Nenad Vuini replaced Mati as head coach KalevCramo won their fourth consecutive Estonian Cup in 2008 The team finished the 200809 regular season in second place In the semifinals KalevCramo easily dispatched TT in three games to reach the finals In the finals the team defeated University of Tartu 4 games to 2 and captured their third title Forward Kristjan Kangur was named Finals MVP and the Estonian Player of the Year In 2009 the team joined the newly established VTB United League In December 2009 Vuini left KalevCramo The team struggled in the 200910 season and finished the regular season in fourth place with a 199 record under the former assistant coach Alar Varrak The team lost in the semifinals to University of Tartu but won the bronze medals in the third place games winning the series in two games against TT

In July 2010 Aivar Kuusmaa returned to KalevCramo Led by Gregor Arbet and Armands le the team finished the 201011 regular season in first place In the playoffs KalevCramo swept Rakvere Tarvas in the semifinals 30 and University of Tartu in the finals 40 le was named Finals MVP and Kuusmaa won his second Coach of the Year award KalevCramo defended their title in the 201112 season defeating Tartu likool in the finals in a fourgame sweep Tanel Sokk was named Finals MVP and Kuusmaa once again won the Coach of the Year award

KalevCramo struggled early in the 201213 season and after a 6995 defeat to Rakvere Tarvas on 22 November 2012 Kuusmaa was sacked with assistant coach Alar Varrak taking over the coaching reins Despite the poor start KalevCramo finished the regular season in first place and swept the playoffs KalevCramo won their 6th Estonian Championship as Tanel Sokk claimed his second straight Finals MVP award Alar Varrak was named Coach of the Year The team also placed third in the 201213 Baltic Basketball League With star players Gregor Arbet and Frank Elegar and the additions of Vlad Moldoveanu and Rain Veideman the teams success continued in the 201314 season KalevCramo once again finished the regular season in first place and was undefeated in the playoffs KalevCramo won their fourth consecutive Estonian Championship while Moldoveanu was named Finals MVP and Varrak won his second Coach of the Year award The team finished the 201415 regular season in second place KalevCramo swept TT in the quarterfinals and Rapla in the semifinals In the finals KalevCramo once again faced University of Tartu but lost the series 14 On 20 December 2015 KalevCramo won their fifth Estonian Cup defeating University of Tartu 7355 in the final KalevCramo finished the 201516 season regular season in first place and undefeated The team extended their winning streak in the quarter and semifinals In the finals the team faced University of Tartu and won the series 4 games to 1 the single loss being the teams only defeat in the season Rolands Freimanis was named Finals MVP KalevCramo defended their title in the 201617 season facing Rapla in the finals and winning the series 4 games to 0 Branko Mirkovi was named Finals MVP The team won their third consecutive league title in the 201718 season defeating University of Tartu in the finals 4 games to 0 Kristjan Kangur who returned to the club for the season was named Finals MVP

Waconda Spring
Waconda Spring or Great Spirit Spring was a natural artesian spring located in Mitchell County near the towns of Glen Elder and Cawker City in the US state of Kansas It was a sacred site for Native American tribes of the Great Plains and for a time became the site of a health spa for American settlers With the completion of the Glen Elder Dam in 1968 the mineral spring disappeared beneath the waters of Waconda Reservoir

Waconda Spring was situated on the bank of the Solomon River below the North and South Forks of the river
The water flowing from the spring had deposited a large cone of travertine around it
In 1866 surveyor David E Ballard described it

The Spring itself is a natural curiousity it being located on the summit of a cone shaped limestone rock The rock is circular about 200 feet in diameter at the base and about 30 feet high upon the summit of this rests the spring the basin being circular and about 30 feet in diameter its outlet is a trough apparently formed by the action of the water upon the rock The water in the spring is about 20 feet deep and exceedingly strong with salt

The name Waconda is from the Kanza language and translates as spirit water or Great Spirit Spring However it is located in territory controlled by the Pawnee
who knew it by the names Pahowa and Kitzawitzuk the latter translated as water on a bank

In the Pawnee traditional religion the supreme being Tirawa allots supernatural powers to certain animals These animals the nahurac act as Tirawas servants and messengers and intercede for the Pawnee with Tirawa

The nahurac had five lodges of which Waconda Spring was one The foremost among them was Pahuk usually translated hill island a bluff on the south side of the Platte River near the town of Cedar Bluffs in presentday Saunders County Nebraska
Lalawakohtito or dark island was an island in the Platte near Central City Nebraska Ahkawitakol or white bank was on the Loup River opposite the mouth of the Cedar River in what is now Nance County Nebraska and Pahur or hill that points the way was a bluff south of the Republican River near Guide Rock Nebraska

Beside the Pawnee many other Native American tribes venerated Waconda Spring often casting articles of value into it as offerings George Bird Grinnell describes the offerings of the Pawnee as including blankets and robes blue beads eagle feathers and moccasins

A geoglyph produced by the intaglio technique of removing the surface sod to form a figure is located on a hillside about two miles southwest of Waconda Spring The figure represents an unidentified animal possibly a beaver It is thought to be several hundred years old soil analysis indicates that it was renewed at least once after its initial excavation suggesting that it was in use over an extended period of time

It is said that the first European explorer to visit Waconda Spring was Sir William Johnson in 1767 however this is unlikely The first recorded visit to the site was by General Zebulon Pike in 1806 Pike visited the spring during his exploration of the Great Plains after he had concluded a treaty with the Pawnee

Settlement in the area did not take place until after Kansas became a state in 1861 The first settler in the region was in 1870 by a man named Pfeiffer who took out the first claim on the property Kansas Senator Samuel C Pomeroy toured the region in 1870 and marveled at what he saw Said Pomeroy At first I declared it the Crater of an Ancient Volcano The Water occupying its hollow center is fathomless and about 200 feet in diameter in a perfect circle It is always brimming full and running over on all sides  The hills about it were as sacred to the Indians as those about Jerusalem Pomeroy recognized the sites commercial potential and went on to predict that a health resort would soon be built in the region

Within a few years a man named Burnham constructed a bottling works on the site and began selling the mineral water as a health tonic He called it Waconda Flier The sales of Waconda Flier piqued the interest of an eastern investor named McWilliams who in 1884 invested in the site and began the construction of a stone sanitarium The spring was fenced off and completely privatized The building was completed ten years later and under the management of G W Cooper Waconda Spring became a hotel and health spa Sales of Waconda Flier continued and by the 1890s it was being sold in all parts of the country In 1904 Waconda Flier won a medal for its superior medicinal qualities at the St Louis Worlds Fair

In 1906 Dr G P Abrahams purchased the property from McWilliams and continued operating the health spa and bottling plant until his 1924 death In 1924 the property passed to Dr Carl Bingesser who had married Abrahams daughter Anna in 1907 Under both Abrahams and Bingesser the hotel resort was improved upon and maintained a solid reputation as health spa and place of healing It continued to do so even as the spa passed on to Dr Carlos Bingesser the third generation of the AbrahamsBingesser family to own and operate the spa The facilities were fully modernized and offered physical therapy hydrotherapy electrotherapy and dietary regimens Water from Waconda Spring was used for internal and external cleansing of the body It was piped into every bathtub in the sanitarium was served with meals and used for enemas A popular slogan used to lure tourists to the resort was It will clean works until your works work Waconda Spring was a popular profitable enterprise for the Bingesser family

In 1944 the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers announced plans for a large earthen dam on the Solomon River near the town of Glen Elder The plan called for the inundation of Waconda Spring The Bingesser family fought to stop the plan but in 1951 greater than normal rainfall in Kansas led to massive flooding in Topeka and other Kansas towns This led to renewed calls for dams and other flood control projects including renewed calls for the Glen Elder Dam Dr Bingesser brought in a respected hydrologist to inspect Waconda Spring The hydrologist concluded that Waconda Spring was unique and possibly the only spring like it in the world However commercial advocates in favor of the dam dismissed the hydrologist and dismissively claimed that Waconda Spring was nothing more than a mud hole

In the end the developers won Construction on Glen Elder Dam began in 1964 and was completed by the end of 1968 Engineers bulldozed the hotel and health spa then adding insult to injury dumped the debris into the pool of Waconda Spring Water from the Solomon River began filling up the valley and by 1970 it was full The irreplaceable Waconda Spring was lost beneath the waters of the reservoir that now bears its name

No 298 Squadron RAF
No 298 Squadron was a Royal Air Force special operations squadron during the Second World War Later in that war it changed to the transport role disbanding after the end of the hostilities

No 298 Squadron was formed on 24 August 1942 at RAF Thruxton from a nucleus of 297 Squadron as a special operations squadron equipped with the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley The squadron was however not required for operations so the formation was suspended and the squadron was disbanded on 19 October 1942

The squadron was reformed on 4 November 1943 at RAF Tarrant Rushton from A Flight of 295 Squadron with the Handley Page Halifax It trained to airtow the big General Aircraft Hamilcar glider but began operations in February 1944 in its original role dropping SOE agents On 16 March 1944 298 Squadrons C Flight split off to form 644 squadron

During the Normandy landing the squadron airtowed both the Airspeed Horsas and the Hamilcars to landingzones around the beach head An unusual operation involved parachuting jeeps which had been carried underneath the Halifax The squadron then returned again to SOE duties In between the SOE duties the squadron airtowed Hamilcar and Horsa gliders for the Arnhem landing Operation Market Garden The squadron moved in March 1945 to RAF Woodbridge England to airtow gliders for the Rhine crossing Operation Varsity After Operation Varsity the squadron flew normal supply and transport duties

In July 1945 the squadron moved to Raipur British India to provide transport support to the Army In March 1946 the squadron was involved in ricedropping sorties from Meiktila Burma to the starving population in the jungle areas The squadron disbanded at Mauripur Sindh British India Now Pakistan Air Force Base Masroor on 21 December or 30 December 1946

BMW R602
The R60 and R602 are 600cc boxertwin that were manufactured from 1956 to 1969 in Munich Germany by BMW

Some 20133 of these 600cc shaftdrive opposed twin R60 19561960  R602 19601969  and R60US 19681969 30hp were built These models except for those with the US designation were designed primarily as rugged motorcycles to pull sidecars mounting points were built in and had duplex tubular steel frames

Simultaneously manufactured were related models including the 500cc R50 19551960  the R502 19601969 26hp the R50 S 19601962  the R50US 19681969 26hp and the 600cc sportoriented R69 19551960 35hp R69S 19601969  and R69US 19681969 42hp

In the United States all these Earlesfork and USfork ie telescopic fork models from 1955 to 1969 are often lumped together as Slash2 BMWs even though that is technically incorrect Not all of them as seen above have the 2 designation

Perhaps the most famous BMW rider of the 1960s was Danny Liska who took R60 models from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego in one trip and from Europes North Cape to South Africas Cape of Good Hope in a second journey His book about the first trip Two Wheels to Adventure Alaska to Argentina by Motorcycle was published in 1989 with a second edition published in 2004 In the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance John and Sylvia accompany Robert Pirsig the author and his son Chris on a 1968 road trip from Minnesota to San Francisco riding a BMW R60 Throughout the book Pirsig contrasts his passion and care in taking care of his bike to Johns fear of technology The BMW is famous for not giving mechanical problems on the road and thats what he is counting on

Though BMW first used oildamped telescopic front forks in the 1930s it chose to use Earles forks on these models The triangular front Earles fork named after its designer Englishman Ernest Earles
precluded any frontend dive during heavy front braking which is common with telescopic front forks It also worked well in sidecar duty Though heavy and ponderous in turning the Earles fork gave the old Beemer a steady and reassuring ride

In 1968 BMW introduced telescopic forks on some of its slash2 models and they were continued into the 1969 model year Modified they became the front forks on the slash5 models introduced for the 1970 model year The photo of the red R60US to the right was taken at a BMW dealership in 1968 and shows a brandnew motorcycle waiting for its first buyer Earles fork and telescopic fork models both were manufactured for these two years and were available to customers

During the 1960s very few motorcycles were available with shaft final drive BMWs were the most common The driveshaft rode in an enclosed oil bath within the right swingarm unlike BMWs previous models and drove the rear wheel through an internally splined cup that meshes with a coupler crown gear keyed to the drive pinion This meant that leaking seals could become a problem for the owners Because the clutch was dry there were seals at the rear of the crankshaft at both ends of the transmission at the rear of the driveshaft and at the front and rear of the rear drive unit lots of seals to develop leaks

The front brakes were double leading shoes and the rear had a single leading shoe By modern standards they were not good brakes Tires front and rear were interchangeable in 350inch by 18inch size

Motorcycles sold in America had high handlebars with a cross brace Those sold elsewhere came with low Euro handlebars

A variety of saddle styles were available for these motorcycles Those delivered in the U S typically were supplied with a single dual or bench saddle either the standard size or a wide version that came with chrome rearquarter passenger handles Alternatives available included a Denfeld not Denfield or Pagusa solo drivers saddle or individual driver and passenger saddles

BMW motorcycles of the 1960s were noted as longdistance touring motorcycles However none came standard with fairings or luggage these items were provided by aftermarket vendors
Fairings included the Wixom Ranger handlebarmounted fairing made in Illinois and Avon
There were numerous manufacturers of saddle bags and top cases for BMW twins in the 1960s including Wixom Britishmade Craven and leather saddlebags imported by Butler and Smith who also offered several styles of luggage carriers for mounting behinds the passenger saddle It also offered several styles of windshields safety bars a spotlight metric tool kits and a mechanical tachometer

US motorcycles came standard with a narrow dual saddle though wide dual saddles with chrome rear handles could be ordered Solo saddles made by Pagusa or Denfeld for driver and passenger were also available All motorcycles came with a tool kit Hella turn signals were optional photo below left and were mounted at the ends of the handlebars showing light both forward and back

The standard fuel tank held  though a commonly purchased option was a more bulbous tank Also available as options were sport tanks of and capacities

An oval shaped safety bar photo right was available for all 195569 BMW motorcycles from the American importer Butler and Smith New York

<doc id="7716582" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716582" title="Aniseikonia">
Aniseikonia
Aniseikonia is an ocular condition where there is a significant difference in the perceived size of images It can occur as an overall difference between the two eyes or as a difference in a particular meridian

When this magnification difference becomes excessive the effect can cause diplopia suppression disorientation eyestrain headache and dizziness and balance disorders

Retinal image size is determined by many factors The size and position of the object being viewed affects the characteristics of the light entering the system Corrective lenses affect these characteristics and are used commonly to correct refractive error The optics of the eye including its refractive power and axial length also play a major role in retinal image size

Aniseikonia can occur naturally or be induced by the correction of a refractive error usually anisometropia having significantly different refractive errors between each eye or antimetropia being myopic nearsighted in one eye and hyperopic farsighted in the other Meridional aniseikonia occurs when these refractive differences only occur in one meridian see astigmatism Refractive surgery can cause aniseikonia in much the same way that it is caused by glasses and contacts

One cause of significant anisometropia and subsequent aniseikonia has been aphakia Aphakic patients do not have a crystalline lens The crystalline lens is often removed because of opacities called cataracts The absence of this lens left the patient highly hyperopic farsighted in that eye For some patients the removal was only performed on one eye resulting in the anisometropia  aniseikonia Today this is rarely a problem because when the lens is removed in cataract surgery an intraocular lens or IOL is left in its place

A way to demonstrate aniseikonia is to hold a near target ex pen or finger approximately 6 inches directly in front of one eye The person then closes one eye and then the other The person should notice that the target appears larger to the eye that it is directly in front of When this object is viewed with both eyes it is seen with a small amount of aniseikonia The principles behind this demonstration are relative distance magnification closer objects appear larger and asymmetrical convergence the target is not an equal distance from each eye

Treatment is done by changing the optical magnification properties of the auxiliary optics corrective lenses The optical magnification properties of spectacle lenses can be adjusted by changing parameters like the base curve vertex distance and center thickness Contact lenses may also provide a better optical magnification to reduce the difference in image size The difference in magnification can also be eliminated by a combination of contact lenses and glasses creating a weak telescope system The optimum design solution will depend on different parameters like cost cosmetic implications and if the patient can tolerate wearing a contact lens

Note however that before the optics can be designed first the aniseikonia should be measured When the image disparity is astigmatic cylindrical and not uniform images can appear wider taller or diagonally different When the disparity appears to vary across the visual field fielddependent aniseikonia as may be the case with an epiretinal membrane or retinal detachment the aniseikonia cannot fully be corrected with traditional optical techniques like standard corrective lenses However partial correction often improves the patients vision comfort significantly Little is known yet about the possibilities of using surgical intervention to correct aniseikonia

Tamajdan Sports and Recreation Center
Tamajdan Sports and Recreation Center  abbr Tamajdan SRC commonly known simply as Ta  literally Tash is a sporting and recreational center located in the city of Belgrade Serbia It was founded by the Assembly of the City of Belgrade in 1958

At within the center located of the outdoor Tamajdan Stadium the Aleksandar Nikoli Hall the Pionir Ice Hall and a complex of outdoor and indoor swimming pools

Built with white stone from Bra island and opened on 24 January 1954 by mid 2000s the stadium began showing signs of structural deterioration Architect Mihajlo Jankovi was awarded the Belgrades October award for architecture the highest city award at the time for the Tamajdan project Originally the sports complex started as the ice factory where people could buy the socalled hygienic ice

Some of the best known happenings in the venue include EuroBasket Women 1954 first Miss Yugoslavia contest in 1957 won by Tonka Katunari 1957 World Womens Handball Championship the inaugural world women championship concerts of Alexandrov Ensemble in 1958 and later in the 1960s and 1970s of Mazowsze Elton John Ray Charles and Tina Turner and ice hockey matches with over 10000 spectators Yugoslav national tennis team played the Davis Cup matches in 1956 in Tamajdan and the curiosities held in the facility include the chess with live figures the football matches played by the Zastava 750 cars and the first Spanish corrida in Europe outside of Spain when Luis Miguel Domingun performed Tamajdan hosted the first FINA World Aquatics Championships in 1973

After the 197778 season the ice skating rink was dismantled in March 1978 Bad conditions of the facility in the 2000s led many public personalities in Belgrade Cane Kosti Neda Arneri Branko Cveji to urge the city government to do something about it In midApril 2009 the initiative called Ta je na  Ta is ours was held to draw public attention to the sad state of the crumbling facility In the summer of 2009 the stadium was closed to the public due to the impending reconstruction An extensive RSD550million renovation began in September 2011 Originally the reconstruction was to be finished in December 2012 then was postponed to 2014 and was finally completed in 2016 As the object is under the protection the conceptual solution for the reconstruction had to fully preserve the original authors concept Since 2016 the ice skating rink became operational again during the winter It covers and though it worked only for less than 60 days in 2016 it had 30000 visitors

The outdoor swimming pool was opened on 25 June 1961 Its capacity is 2500 and swimming beaches hold around 4000 people

The indoor swimming pool was opened on 13 December 1968 The pools dimensions are 5020m The capacity for spectators is 2000 seats Within the same building there is a recreation center a gym a small swimming pool and a hotel named Ta

Pasteur pipette
Pasteur pipettes also known as droppers or eye droppers are used to transfer small quantities of liquids They are usually glass tubes tapered to a narrow point and fitted with a rubber bulb at the top The combination of the Pasteur pipette and rubber bulb has also been referred to as a teat pipette Pasteur pipettes come in various lengths and are usually sold in boxes of hundreds They are named after the French scientist Louis Pasteur who was known to have used a variant of them extensively during his research In the past there was no equipment to transfer a chemical solution without exposing it to the external environment The hygiene and purity of chemical compounds is necessary for the expected result of each experiment The Pasteur pipette both glass and plastic types are sterilized and plugged with a rubber bulb at the open end of the pipette preventing any contamination from the atmosphere Generally they are considered cheap enough to be disposable however so long as the glass point is not chipped the Pasteur pipette may be washed and reused indefinitely

The name eye dropper also may refer to early models of fountainpens which have to be refilled with some kind of Pasteur pipette

It is not recommended to use pasteur pipettes for work involving accuracy since pasteur pipettes are not designed to measure specific volume however it can be used to add drops of reagents Before using a pasteur pipette the tip should be carefully examined for cracks To increase accuracy the pipette is to be rinsed with the reagent To use the pipette squeeze the bulb to expel air out of the pipette and submerge the tip of the pipette to the solution vertically Gently relax the bulb to draw the solution up and make sure that the solution does not overshoot into the bulb contaminating it To dispense the reagent hold the tip against the side of the target container at a 30 to 45 degrees angle

Broken pasteur pipettes should be disposed of in an appropriate glassware container

Nowadays the two types of glass that are used mainly in the laboratory and in the Pasteur pipette are borosilicate glass and soda lime glass Borosilicate glass is a widely used glass for laboratory apparatus as it can withstand chemicals and temperatures used in most laboratories Borosilicate glass is also more economical since the glass can be fabricated easily compared to other types Soda lime glass although not as chemically resistant as Borosilicate glass are suitable as a material for inexpensive apparatus such as the Pasteur pipette

Plastic Pasteur pipettes also referred to as transfer pipettes have their stems and bulbs in the form of a single piece made of plastic They commonly come in 1 2 3 and 5 ml which comes with a specific drop size of 10 20 25 35 and 50 l The volumes are usually marked on the stem though the markings are rather crude and are not particularly accurate

As plastic Pasteur is relatively inexpensive and disposable they are often used to avoid crosscontamination In a solution containing cell andor protein it reduces the loss of cell andor protein that binds to glass The designation of the plastic pipettes contain the long flexible tube It can be bent for drawing solution from small volume tubes

Plastic Pasteur pipettes are often used in biology where most media are aqueous and solvent resistance is not important Most organic solvents such as hexane and acetone cannot be used in plastic Pasteur pipettes as the solvent can dissolve the plastic The pipettes are also hard to wash and are usually discarded with other biohazard waste after each use

Plastic bulb pipettes are generally not precise enough to be used for exact measurements whereas their glass counterparts can be extremely precise

The constriction toward the tip of the Pasteur pipettes may be plugged with a bit of tissue paper or cotton wool to filter off solids from small amounts of liquids The bulb can be attached and squeezed to help viscous solutions filter more rapidly

With a bit of skill Pasteur pipettes may also be used for microscale column chromatography With appropriately fine silica gel the bulb may be squeezed for microscale flash column chromatography

Pasteur pipettes can also be used for microscale distillation The liquid to be distilled is placed into a small reaction tube along with a boiling chip and heated to reflux onehalf to twothirds of the way up the inside of the tube After squeezing the bulb to expel air a pasteur pipette is inserted into the tube just below the level of the ring of refluxing liquid into the vapor The vapor is then drawn into the relatively cold pipette tip causing it to condense and accumulate inside of the pipette

Heat can be applied to the tip of a plastic Pasteur pipette to seal the solution and create a liquidtight storage

Medical Laboratory

Medical Laboratory required high efficiency and precision for drug test and observation of diseases Pasteur pipettes are commonly used in the medical lab because of its essential accuracy The design of the Pasteur pipette allows for high effective performance in the medical lab It produces a constant volume of drop This reduces the concern of liquid remaining in the pipette

Ross Technology
Ross Technology Inc was a semiconductor design and manufacturing company specializing in SPARC microprocessors It was founded in Austin Texas in August 1988 by Dr Roger D Ross a leading computer scientist who headed Motorolas Advanced Microprocessor Division and directed the developments of Motorolas MC68030 and RISCbased 88000 microprocessor families

Dr Ross was accompanied by Carl Dobbs Janet Sooch Steve Goldstein and Travor Smith who were from Motorolas Highend Microprocessor Division and were involved in the development of the 88000 microprocessor He was later was joined by Am29000 engineer Raju Vegesna from AMD who was originally hired by Dr Ross at Motorola

Cypress Semiconductor provided initial funding Original board members included Dr Ross and wellknown figures as Dr T J Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Venture Capital and L J Sevin of Sevin Rosen Venture Capital who also served as Board Chairman Ross eventually became a subsidiary of Cypress

In September 1988 the company was tied up in a lawsuit launched by Motorola Motorola alleged that Ross and the other former Motorola staff had proprietary marketing material as well as all the 68000 and 88000 technical data and sought a temporary injunction and 8 million in compensation and punitive damages Motorola offered to settle the lawsuit without litigation if the former Motorola staff agreed not to work on modern computer architecture for 18 months In late September 1988 Motorola withdrew the temporary injunction after former Motorola staff agreed not to compromise proprietary information regarding the 68000 and 88000 microprocessors The lawsuit was settled in October

In midOctober after the lawsuit from Motorola was settled AMD launched a lawsuit over the hiring of Raju Vegesna who was involved in the design of the Am29000 It was settled in late October with AMD getting limited rights to inspect Ross RISCrelated designs

Ross first products were SPARC chip sets On 23 April 1990 Cypress announced the CY7C611 a microprocessor developed by Ross for embedded applications Later Ross was tasked by Cypress to develop the Pinnacle microprocessor a superscalar SPARC implementation intended to compete with the Sun Microsystems and Texas Instruments SuperSPARC In May 1993 Pinnacle was revealed to be the hyperSPARC and the microprocessor was announced in May 1993

Cypress had bet the companys success on the hyperSPARC threatening to abandon SPARC in favor of Digital Equipment Corporations Alpha if Sun did not endorse the design Although International Computers Limited and Meiko Scientific were claimed by Cypress to be major customers of hyperSPARC the microprocessor was used in small quantities and by a handful of small vendors Repeated delays in shipping the design as a result of design and fabrication problems at Cypress contributed to the small number of users

As the hyperSPARC had failed to win major customers Cypress sold Ross to Fujitsu for 23 million on 12 May 1993 Fujitsu was interested in Ross for its hyperSPARC design which it considered to be competitive At the time Fujitsus SPARC business was limited to embedded designs after an unsuccessful attempt in the early 1990s to develop a highend SPARC when the market for such designs was limited After several government oversight committee hearings in Washington DC the sale was permitted to proceed Under Fujitsu the existing Board of Directors was replaced with its own members with the exception of Dr Ross who was named chairman

The company was taken public by Robertson Stephens  Company on 7 November 1995 but Fujitsu kept a controlling interest in the company and continued to control the Board of Directors Sun Microsystems also took a 10 interest in the company and was allowed to name a director as well

In February 1996 Ross Technology formed Ross Microcomputer in Sonoma California to produce workstations and servers for valueadded resellers VARs and original equipment manufacturers OEMs Their first product the hyperStation was known since the divisions creation and was introduced in June 1996 The systems used hyperSPARC microprocessors

In 1995 Sun Microsystems introduced the 64bit UltraSPARC microprocessor As Sun was the dominant SPARC vendor the majority of the market followed and began the migration to 64bit SPARC As a result the 32bit SPARC market began to decline

Ross did not have a 64bit SPARC microprocessor and was at a disadvantage as a result Combined with the creation of Ross Microcomputer earlier in the year which incurred restructuring and other costs they began to lose money An effort to regain the companys competitiveness was active at the time and it involved developing a new 64bit microprocessor codenamed Viper Fujitsu provided the initial funding for the project and also agreed to provide Ross Technology with a loan so it could continue operating

The companys stock fell during this period and there were several warnings from NASDAQ in 1997 that the company would be delisted which Ross avoided until 1998 when the companys stock fell below NASDAQ requirements

In April 1998 the company began to consider its financial options including a search for a buyer In May the company warned that a closing of operations was coming and in June 1998 the board of directors decided to begin closing down the company after there were no buyers A new business unit called BridgePoint was formed at this time to manage the existing inventory to meet the requirements of existing customers and to provide support for Ross products Ross Technology closed down in 1998 and all its assets and patents became the property of Fujitsu Ltd

Ross was a significant part of the hardware ecosystem of Suns SPARCbased systems of the time They participated in the design of the MBus architecture and it was Ross Technologys 605based Pinnacle product line that launched Sun servers into the 2x and 4x multiprocessor arena which prior to Ross were confined to single processor server offerings

The hyperSPARC processor developed by Ross viewed first as a competitor to Suns own SPARC processor designs but eventually adopted by Sun and sold both as upgrades and system components It was an emergency engineeringwide Ross hyperSPARC upgrade which enabled Steve Jobs Pixar to complete and deliver their animated movie Toy Story to Disney on schedule after the existing Sun Microsystems machines were overwhelmed in the late product development stage by Pixars demanding new technology

Sancho received his AA degree from Valencia Community College in 1973 He then received his BA in Social Science from Stetson University in 1978 Sancho completed his education with a JD from Florida State University College of Law in 1987

In 1984 Sancho a Democrat was the Leon County leader for Presidential candidate Gary Hart Sancho is a State Certified Supervisor of Elections and nationally certified by the Elections Center as a Certified ElectionsRegistration Administrator CERA Hes a former staff member of the Florida House of Representatives Corrections Probation  Parole Committee He is a member of the Center for Policy Alternatives Voter Participation Advisory Board and member of The Elections Center

After a bid as county commissioner in 1986 Sancho took courses in election machine management and became certified in their use In November 1988 Sancho was elected to his first term as the Supervisor of Elections for Leon County Florida He ran and was reelected in 1992 1996 2000 and 2004 serving his fifth term as of January 2 2005 He was unopposed in each election since 1992

In the 2000 presidential recount Sancho No Party Affiliation was chosen to lead the Florida hand count of ballots in dispute in MiamiDade County The US Supreme Court stopped the hand count in a 72 vote just as it got underway Later the Court ruled 54 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by a December 12 safe harbor deadline

Most voters 99 in Leon County use the optiscan equipment but federal law requires one electronic machine per precinct for visually impaired voters

In 2005 Sancho invited Bev Harris founder of Black Box Voting Kathleen Wynne Black Box Voting Associate Director Harri Hursti computer programmer and security expert Dr Hugh Thompson application security expert and PhD in math Susan Bernecker former Republican candidate for New Orleans city council and Susan Pynchon Director of Florida Fair Elections Coalition to Tallahassee There they performed what is now known as the Hursti Hack which became the center piece of an HBO documentary titled Hacking Democracy
As a result Diebold Election Systems  Software and Sequoia Voting Systems the only 3 companies certified to do business in Florida would not sell Sancho voting machines Automark was contacted by Sancho but the Secretary of State would not certify their voting equipment ESS said did not believe it could have a smooth working relationship with Sancho

In Florida Volusia County joined Leon County in dumping Diebold Elections officials in the states of Maryland North Carolina Texas and California have called into question the security and accuracy of new voting machines

After the test election Secretary of State Sue Cobb R accused Sancho of undermining voter confidence and the Federal Government and demanded the return of a 564000 in grant money given to Sancho through the state to purchase voting machines that would comply with ADA standards as mandated in the Help America Vote Act HAVA a United States federal law passed on October 29 2002

At Leon County Commission meetings on February 14 and February 28 2006 the only two Republicans in the local governments of either the city of Tallahassee or Leon County government Tony Grippa and Ed Depuy of Leon Countys sevenmember county commission blasted Sancho for failing to provide Leon County with accessible voting machines in attacks that Sancho believes were politically motivated

At a Leon County Commission meeting on February 28 2006 county staff revealed that Chuck Owen Division Counsel for Diebold Election Systems met with county staff behind closed doors on February 27 According to staff Owen stated that Diebold would sell its touchscreen voting machines to the county if and only if the county removed Supervisor Sancho from office That same day Commissioner DePuy offered a motion seconded by Commissioner Grippa to request the State Attorney to convene a grand jury to investigate why Leon County is not in compliance with the voting regulations

Tony Grippa left the Leon County Commission in April 2006 Ed DePuy was defeated in 2008 by Democrat Akin Akinyemi

On March 8 2006 Sancho initiated legal proceedings against Diebold Election Systems for breach of contract Attorney Lida Rodriguez Taseff with Duane Morris in Miami filed the suit Diebold refused to return phone calls to Sancho and staff refused to honor its existing contract with Leon County for the maintenance and upgrades of its voting system Further Diebold refused to sell Leon County touchscreen voting machines to meet state and federal requirements for disabled accessibility

Sancho has been on National Public Radio and is familiar to readers of the New York Times the Washington Post St Petersburg Times and appears in the 2006 HBO documentary Hacking Democracy

USS Trippe FF1075
USS Trippe FF1075 was a of the US Navy built at Westwego Louisiana was commissioned in midSeptember 1970 In July 1971 following shakedown training in the Caribbean area and a surveillance mission off Haiti she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul and installation of the Basic Point Defense Missile System which featured shortrange Sea Sparrow guided missiles in an eightround launcher on her afterdeck Trippe was the Navys first destroyertype ship to receive this laterwidespread contribution to shipboard protection against air and missile attack The first months of 1972 were spent testing her new weapons and participating in exercises In June the ship passed through the Panama Canal en route to Southeast Asian waters where she provided Vietnam War aircraft carrier escort and naval gunfire support services during July and August Trippe then went to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf areas visiting many ports in a region that would see increasing US Navy activity in the coming decades She returned to the US East Coast in December 1972 after a deployment that had taken her completely around the World

During an overhaul in 1973 Trippe was refitted to allow her to operate the larger helicopters of the Light Airborne MultiPurpose System LAMPS From August of that year into January 1974 she made her first tour with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean A second cruise to the Indian Ocean and Middle East followed in JanuaryMay 1975 Reclassified in midyear as a frigate with the new designation FF1075 she spent the last three months of 1975 and the first five of 1976 in shipyard hands Trippe returned to the Middle East Force in MarchJuly 1977 and went back to the Mediterranean for her second Sixth Fleet deployment in AprilOctober 1978 The next year she cruised around South American as part of exercise Unitas XX and operated off West Africa

The busy frigate made four more Mediterranean deployments during the following decade in 1982 1983 1985 and 1987 Some of her 1983 tour also involved visiting ports in West Africa the southern Atlantic and the Indian Ocean In the mid80s she was also modernized receiving a seakeepingenhancing bulwark on her bow and the CloseIn Weapons System The latters fast shooting radarcontrolled 20mm gun mount was installed on her afterdeck to improve her defenses against cruise missiles

On 19 April 1989 Trippe collided with fleet oiler off the coast of Jacksonville Florida Trippe returned to Charleston SC under her own power This was the same day as the USS Iowa turret explosion also part of FLEETEX 389

She spent most of the late 1980s and the early 1990s operating in the Caribbean Sea area with counternarcotics service taking much of her effort At the end of July 1992 Trippe was decommissioned and leased to Greece The Hellenic Navy placed her in commission in April 1993 as Thraki and she was formally sold to that nation in 2001 A major lube oil fire occurred while at Naval Dock Crete in 2003 melting the superstructure and destroying the interior of the ship

State of World Liberty Index
The State of World Liberty Index was a ranking of countries according to the degree of economic and personal freedoms that their citizens enjoy It was a compilation of several similar indices created by other organizations The indexs original author Nick Wilson defined freedom as the ability for the individual to live their lives as they choose as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others to do the same

Only one report the 2006 State of World Liberty Index released 12 August 2006 was produced by the State of World Liberty Project and the original website is now defunct However Patrick Rhamey professor in the Department of International Studies at the Virginia Military Institute  has updated the rankings through 2019 using the same concept with some adjustments to the original method

The index has been cited by human rights organisations governments prodemocracy groups news organisations and others

The 2006 State of World Liberty Index was created by combining the rankings of four other indexes of world liberty into one the 2005 Economic Freedom of the World Index Fraser Institute the 2006 Index of Economic Freedom The Heritage Foundation the 2005 Freedom in the World index Freedom House and the 2005 Press Freedom Index Reporters Without Borders

These reports are used to score countries in three categories individual freedom economic freedom and government size and taxation These three scores are then averaged to give a countrys overall score

The 20122019 Rankings reproduce the original ranking concept using the same data sources albeit adjusting the weighting of data to best capture the original intent of measuring the ability of the individual to live their lives as they choose Measures are also standardized appropriately given the different scales used across indices and the government burden category was condensed into the broader indicator of economic freedom

Beginning in 2018 the ranking also includes a measure of how Conservative or Progressive a state defined as whether a state regulates either social or economic issues more heavily

In the 2019 index New Zealand is ranked most free overall while North Korea is last Hong Kong was ranked most free in economic liberty while Norway was ranked most free in the social liberty category

        Androgen replacement therapy
        Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

        ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

        Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

        The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

        Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

        The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

        On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

        There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

        Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

        Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

        As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

        In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

        A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

        Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

        The Marathon Rowing Championship is a continuous rowing regatta on the Cane River Lake in Natchitoches Louisiana Northwestern State University is the official host of the regatta The Marathon begins near the Melrose Plantation and ends at Front Street in Natchitoches The regatta is open to all sculling and sweepoar rowing boats On the day of the Marathon the Cane River is open only to competitors

        The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

        The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

        The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

        Pterodactyloidea
        Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

        Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

        In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

        Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

        A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

        There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
        Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

        14Butynediol is an organic compound that is an alkyne and a diol It is a colourless hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water and polar organic solvents It is a commercially significant compound in its own right and as a precursor to other products

        14Butynediol can be produced in the Reppe synthesis where formaldehyde and acetylene are the reactants

        Several patented production methods use copper bismuth catalysts coated on an inert material The normal temperature range for the reaction is 90C up to 150C depending on the pressure used for the reaction which can range from 1 to 20 bar

        14Butynediol is a precursor to 14butanediol and 2butene14diol by hydrogenation It is also used in the manufacture of certain herbicides textile additives corrosion inhibitors plasticizers synthetic resins and polyurethanes It is the major raw material used in the synthesis of vitamin B It is also used for brightening preserving and inhibiting nickel plating

        It reacts with a mixture of chlorine and hydrochloric acid to give mucochloric acid HOCCClCClCHO see mucobromic acid

        14Butynediol is corrosive and irritates the skin eyes and respiratory tract

        Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

        Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

        While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

        In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

        Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

        Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

        After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

        Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

        After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

        The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

        To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

        Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

        To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

        Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

        As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

        One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

        Nathalia Crane
        Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

        After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

        Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

        She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

        Texas State Highway Loop 150
        Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

        The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

        In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

        Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

    <doc id="7737240" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737240" title="Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate">
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

        In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

        The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

        Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

        The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

        Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

        Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

        In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

        This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

        When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

        In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

        In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

        In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

        Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

        The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

        There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

        In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

        As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

        As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

        On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release

        Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

        IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

        In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

        Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses

        To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

        Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

        Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

        NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

        Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

        An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

        The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

        Pleasant Plains New Jersey
        Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

        Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

        An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

        Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

        Since the early 19th century and possibly even earlier the area featured a oneroom schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Lairds Corner it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its oneroom schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools Moved across the road on log rollers it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development Instead it was moved to the Townships Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation

        The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area

        According to the United States Census Bureau Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3221 square miles 8342km including 3215 square miles 8328km of land and 0006 square miles 0014km of water 017

        The Pleasant Plains Cemetery located on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner was established in 1898

        Peristimulus time histogram
        In neurophysiology peristimulus time histogram and poststimulus time histogram both abbreviated PSTH or PST histogram are histograms of the times at which neurons fire It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram and poststimulus and peristimulus are often hyphenated

        The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

        To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram


        The optimal bin size assuming an underlying Poisson point process  is a minimizer of the formula 2kv
        where k and v are mean and variance of k

        Oklahomas 2nd congressional district
        Oklahomas Second Congressional District is one of five United States Congressional districts in Oklahoma and covers approximately onefourth of the state in the east The district borders Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Texas and includes in whole or in part a total of 24 counties

        Historically the district has supported conservative Democrats and was reckoned as a classic Yellow Dog Democrat district However the growing Republican trend in the state has overtaken the district since the start of the 21st century In the last two elections the Republican presidential candidate has carried it by the largest margin in the state Urban voters represent a third of the district

        The district is represented by Republican Markwayne Mullin becoming only the second Republican after Tom Coburn to hold the seat since 1921

        The district borders Kansas to the north Missouri and Arkansas to the east and Texas along the Red River to the south It covers all or part of 26 counties It includes the remainder of Rogers County including the county seat of Claremore that is not included in the 1st District and then also all of the following counties Adair Nowata Craig Ottawa Mayes Delaware Cherokee Okmulgee Muskogee Sequoyah Okfuskee McIntosh Haskell LeFlore Hughes Pittsburg Latimer Coal Atoka Pushmataha McCurtain Choctaw Bryan Marshall and Johnston

        Some of the principal cities in the district include Miami Claremore Muskogee Tahlequah Okmulgee McAlester and Durant

        The northern half of the district includes most of the area of Oklahoma referred to as Green Country while the southern half of the district includes a part of Oklahoma often referred to as Little Dixie

        According to the 2000 US Census the district is 3551 percent urban 2395 percent nonwhite and has a population that is 240 percent Latino and 136 percent foreignborn The district has a higher percentage of Native Americans than any other congressional district in Oklahoma Its representative Markwayne Mullin is one of two Native Americans currently serving in Congress

        The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

        The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

        Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

        Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

        Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
        The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

        The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

        With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

        Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

        Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990

    <doc id="7737010" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737010" title="Androgen replacement therapy">
        Androgen replacement therapy
        Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

        ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

        Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

        The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

        Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

        The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

        On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

        There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

        Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

        Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

        As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

        In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

        A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

        Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

        The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

        The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

        The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

        In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

        Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

        A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

        There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
        Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

        Fernando Castro Pacheco
        Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

        Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

        Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

        While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

        In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

        Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

        Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

        After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

        Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

        After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

        The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

        To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

        Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

        To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

        Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

        As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

        One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

        Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

        After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

        Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

        She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

        Texas State Highway Loop 150
        Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

        The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

        In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

        Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

    <doc id="7737240" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737240" title="Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate">
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

        In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

        The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

        Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

        The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

        Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

        Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

        In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

        This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

        When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

        In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

        In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

        In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

        Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

        The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

        There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

        In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

        As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

        As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

        On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release

        Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

        IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

        In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

        Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses

        To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

        Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

        Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

        NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

        Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

        An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

        The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

        Pleasant Plains New Jersey
        Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

        Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

        An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

        Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

        Since the early 19th century and possibly even earlier the area featured a oneroom schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Lairds Corner it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its oneroom schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools Moved across the road on log rollers it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development Instead it was moved to the Townships Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation

        The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area

        According to the United States Census Bureau Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3221 square miles 8342km including 3215 square miles 8328km of land and 0006 square miles 0014km of water 017

        The Pleasant Plains Cemetery located on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner was established in 1898

        Peristimulus time histogram
        In neurophysiology peristimulus time histogram and poststimulus time histogram both abbreviated PSTH or PST histogram are histograms of the times at which neurons fire It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram and poststimulus and peristimulus are often hyphenated

        The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

        To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram


        The optimal bin size assuming an underlying Poisson point process  is a minimizer of the formula 2kv

        Oklahomas Second Congressional District is one of five United States Congressional districts in Oklahoma and covers approximately onefourth of the state in the east The district borders Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Texas and includes in whole or in part a total of 24 counties

        Historically the district has supported conservative Democrats and was reckoned as a classic Yellow Dog Democrat district However the growing Republican trend in the state has overtaken the district since the start of the 21st century In the last two elections the Republican presidential candidate has carried it by the largest margin in the state Urban voters represent a third of the district

        The district is represented by Republican Markwayne Mullin becoming only the second Republican after Tom Coburn to hold the seat since 1921

        The district borders Kansas to the north Missouri and Arkansas to the east and Texas along the Red River to the south It covers all or part of 26 counties It includes the remainder of Rogers County including the county seat of Claremore that is not included in the 1st District and then also all of the following counties Adair Nowata Craig Ottawa Mayes Delaware Cherokee Okmulgee Muskogee Sequoyah Okfuskee McIntosh Haskell LeFlore Hughes Pittsburg Latimer Coal Atoka Pushmataha McCurtain Choctaw Bryan Marshall and Johnston

        Some of the principal cities in the district include Miami Claremore Muskogee Tahlequah Okmulgee McAlester and Durant

        The northern half of the district includes most of the area of Oklahoma referred to as Green Country while the southern half of the district includes a part of Oklahoma often referred to as Little Dixie

        According to the 2000 US Census the district is 3551 percent urban 2395 percent nonwhite and has a population that is 240 percent Latino and 136 percent foreignborn The district has a higher percentage of Native Americans than any other congressional district in Oklahoma Its representative Markwayne Mullin is one of two Native Americans currently serving in Congress

        The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

        The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

        Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

        Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

        Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
        The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

        The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

        With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

        Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

        Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990
