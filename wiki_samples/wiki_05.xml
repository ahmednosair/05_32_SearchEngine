Compliance and ethics program
Since about 1970 several major business and government excesses were seen in the United States to generate subsequent legal public and political reaction The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is perhaps the legislation with the most significant influence in the development of ethics and compliance programs similar ideas are encoded in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA marked the early beginnings of compliance programs in the United States In the mid1970s United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC investigations discovered that a significant number of American companies participated in bribery overseas Over 400 US Companies admitted to making questionable or illegal payments to foreign government officials politicians and political parties United States Department of Justice 2006 One of the most infamous cases of its time was the admission by a Lockheed executive to the Multinational Corporations Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Lockheed had paid bribes in the amount of 22 million to Japanese government officials in the course of trying to sell its aircraft This revelation came on the heels of the US Government providing Lockheed with a 250 million emergency loan guarantee Hishikawa 2003

In an effort to restore faith in American business in December 1977 the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was signed into law This antibribery provision makes it unlawful for a US person and certain foreign issuers of securities to make a corrupt payment to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with or directing business to any person United States Department of Justice 2006 The law also requires publicly traded companies to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent the companys transactions Additionally it requires these companies to have an adequate systems of internal accounting controls United States Department of Justice 2006

Following the passage of the FCPA in 1988 the Congress became concerned that American companies were operating at a disadvantage because their foreign counterparts were as a matter of practice paying bribes to foreign officials and deducting those bribes as business expenses on their taxes United States Department of Justice 2006 Subsequently the Executive Branch began negotiations with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD a 34member nation coalition consisting of the United States and 33 other countries to enact legislation similar to FCPA In 1997 the OCED signed the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions httpwwwoecdorgdocument2102340en2649348592017813111100html

This regulation requires member nations to designate the payment of bribes to foreign offices as a crime and to follow the rules and regulations that govern bribery in international transactions The US ratified this convention and enacted implementing legislation in 1998 At this time the FCPA was amended to include territorial jurisdiction over foreign companies and nationals A foreign company or person is now subject to the FCPA if the company or person either directly or indirectly through agents engages in acts which further the facilitation of corrupt payments taking place within the territory of the United States

In response to the FCPA and its requirement to implement internal control programs in 1985 a privatesector initiative was formed called the National Committee on Fraudulent Financial Reporting commonly known as the Treadway Commission This Commission recommended that its organizational sponsors work together to develop guidance on internal controls Subsequently the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO was formed and in conjunction with the CPA firm Coopers  Lybrand COSO authored and published in 1992 the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework This framework has become the de facto standard in the accounting industry for auditing evaluating and monitoring internal control systems

The COSO Internal ControlIntegrated Framework is now widely used by most organizations as the basis for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting  15 USC  7262 and for the assessment of control effectiveness under section 404 of SarbanesOxley

In 1984 Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act which created a set of mandatory federal sentencing guidelines Campbell  Bemporad 2006 As part of the Act the United States Sentencing Commission was formed and delegated the responsibility to provide certainty and fairness in sentencing avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities while maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentencing when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors Campbell  Bemporad 2006

On May 1 1991 as an extension of the Sentencing Reform Act the United States Sentencing Commission submitted to Congress the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations FSGO a set of standards that govern the sentences federal judges impose on organizations convicted of federal crimes Enacted on November 1 1991 core to the guidelines was the Commissions intent to prevent and deter organizational wrongdoing through its design of the organizational sentencing guidelines These guidelines describe the elements of an organizations compliance and ethics program that are required to be considered for eligibility for a reduced sentence if convicted In general the FSGO require an organization to establish standards to guide its employees and agents These standards must reflect government regulations and industry standards and apply to almost all types of organizations including corporations partnerships unions nonprofit organizations and trusts

In 2004 the United States Sentencing Commission voted to amend its existing organization guidelines to make the criteria for an effective compliance and ethics program more stringent Two major standards were identified in the amended guidelines The amended guidelines stated the need for directors and executives to take an active role in the management of its compliance and ethics program and the importance of promoting an organizational culture that is compliant with the law and demonstrates ethical culture The amended guidelines outline minimum requirements for an effective compliance and ethics program and the amended FSGO has become synonymous with an effective compliance program

The FCPA SarbanesOxley SOX and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines represent just a fraction of the standards and requirements organizations need to consider today when developing and implementing their compliance programs Since the passage of SOX the New York Stock Exchange NYSE NASDAQ and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB have all proposed and implemented new rules relating to compliance programs Martin 2004 Organizations today are increasingly accountable to mandated laws regulations and standards on a number of dimensions which include geographicalregional considerations as well as industry and functional discipline concerns These regulations and standards apply to a variety of financial and nonfinancial areas Adding to this complexity are the voluntary boundaries which organizations have individually established such as organizational commitments values and contractual obligations As a result of these dynamics organizations at the very core of their business strategy need to establish the capacity and the capability to effectively address the conditions mandated by these external requirements and internally generated operating principles while still meeting their business objectives

History set the tone for increasing regulations and rising standards Over time organizations will need to be more proactive in anticipating and addressing these considerations while simultaneously protecting and building the enterprise More and more organizations will need to translate integrate and simplify these various standards and requirements into a cohesive approach

Designing an effective compliance and ethics program requires implementing a detailed plan that will make sure the business achieves their ethics objectives The organization must have ways of managing evaluating and controlling business ethics and compliance programs There are five items which can affect the success of the compliance and ethics program 1 the content of the companys code of ethics 2 the frequency of communication regarding the ethical code and program 3 the quality of communication 4 senior managements ability to successfully incorporate ethics into the organization 5 and local managements ability to do the same

Compliance and ethics program with regulatory requirements and the organizations own policies are a critical component of effective risk management An organizations program is recommended to include monitoring and auditing systems that allow detection of criminal and other improper context to be found easily Maintaining the compliance and ethics program is one of the most important ways for an organization to maintain its ethical health support its longterm prosperity and preserve and promote its values

A compliance and ethics program supports the organizations business objectives identifies the boundaries of legal and ethical behavior and establishes a system to alert management when the organization is getting close to or crossing a boundary or approaching an obstacle that prevents the achievement of a business objective

Management should continuously improve its compliance and ethics program This will enable it to better prevent detect and respond to similar misfeasance andor malfeasance in the future

The compliance and ethics program should strive to deliver tangible benefits and outcomes to the organization Every organization is unique and has its own objectives As such several objectives of the compliance and ethics program will be unique as well There are a few universal program outcomesobjectives that a compliance and ethics capability should deliver These include an enhanced culture of trust accountability and integrity prevention of noncompliance preparation for when not if noncompliance occurs protection to the extent possible from negative consequences detection of noncompliance response to noncompliance and improvement of the program to better prevent protect prepare detect and respond to noncompliance

An important aspect of a highperforming program and one that cannot be overstated is enhancing an ethical culture A strong ethical culture that provides important benefits would including a safety net for when formal controls are weak or absent and an open environment of trust ingredients that help drive overall workforce productivity

A welldesigned compliance and ethics program is only half the picture Critical to its success and its ability to meet the challenges of constant change increasing complexity rapidly evolving threats the need for continuous improvement requires organizations to have the commitment of both senior management and the board adequate authorization and funding the appropriate tools to facilitate measurement and rollingup information comprehensive training on the measurement process and an early socialization of approach

Implementation is often the most difficult aspect of any program This is the juncture where most failure occurs However if executed well it can represent the biggest opportunity for positive influence on the organizations performance and culture

The engaged involvement of key stakeholders is critical to a successful implementation or major enhancement of a compliance and ethics program ie the dialogue and agreement up front by all the major parties regarding the objectives goals and overall purpose of the program will be critical to the projects eventual impact By working together compliance and ethics officers executive management and the board can help ensure a compliance and ethics program not only contributes to the improvement of the organizations governance practices but the success of its companys strategy as well

One of most important conditions for an ethics program to be effectively implemented is the existence of a feeling of trust from the employees toward the organization Organizations that present high levels of misconduct will experience lack of trust from its employees which possible will cause high turnover among its workforce

Integrate compliance and ethics  Address the letter of the law while promoting the spirit of the law For some companies this means making a breach of company policy as serious as breaching laws resulting in internal standards being as important as mandatory standards

Embed compliance and ethics risk management processes into the business  Organizations must systematically assess and prioritize present and emerging compliance and ethics risks Such analysis should take into account the organizations culture compliance and ethics history as well as industry issues Business processes should incorporate compliance and ethics program needs Boards should routinely discuss these risks and how they are addressed with management

Demonstrate leadership  The board should ensure senior management consistently communicates and models the organizations values and behavioral expectations identified in the compliance and ethics program

Require accountability and ownership  In order to have the compliance and ethics program make a difference it should foster a corporate culture that places responsibility on individuals for their actions and motivates everyone The board and management should ensure employees have appropriate training and information and should participate in such training themselves

Provide an open culture  Issues and problems should be and in some cases are required by law to be investigated and proactively managed to resolution Unethical or illegal behavior should be addressed promptly Employees must be required to raise and resolve violations of compliance or ethics standards To do so they must feel confident that they can take action without fear of retaliation Such fears have been reduced but not eliminated with the introduction of the whistleblower protections of the SarbanesOxley Act and the Canadian equivalents The board should inquire of management the steps they are taking to create this open culture

Measure performance and results  Compliance and ethics processes and results should be monitored and measured Objective data should support evaluations that are more subjective Evaluation results should provide the basis for continually improving the program

By using accurate timely data on the organizations performance managers know whether they are moving the entity closer to its objectives Measuring compliance and ethics program performance help organizations gauge their improvement and learn whether the companys tactics are contributing to the success of the companys strategy Keeping the board informed is a critical activity and robust performance reporting facilitates that important effort too An organizations compliance and ethics program should be measured like any other critical capability

There are numerous benefits and challenges to measuring the performance of a program A wellknown maxim is what gets measured gets done The compliance and ethics program and capability is no different

The Open Compliance and Ethics Group OCEG a nonprofit organization that provides a performance framework for integrating governance compliance risk management and culture has developed a Measurement and Metrics Guide MMG for assisting in measuring and reporting on the performance of compliance and ethics programs This measurement platform advocates that program objectives be aligned with and contribute to the enterprise objectives in a tangible way In order to achieve desired program outcomes an organization should design processes and practices that effectively measure program dimensions on three key dimensions effectiveness efficiency and responsiveness



A solid measurement system and approach should be implemented that embodies these principles 
Key metrics and indicators should be specificsimple measurable actionable relevant and timely

Performance measurement system should be reviewed and improved on an ongoing basis It is only by gaining experience measuring performance that the organization can really refine and improve the system

Compliance risk is the current and prospective risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of or nonconformance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices internal policies and procedures or ethical standards Compliance risk also arises in situations where the laws or rules governing certain bank products or activities of the Banks clients may be ambiguous or untested This risk exposes the institution to fines civil money penalties payment of damages and the voiding of contracts Compliance risk can lead to diminished reputation reduced franchise value limited business opportunities reduced expansion potential and an inability to enforce contracts

Governance Risk Management and Compliance GRC management capability is the solution to addressing increasing stakeholder expectations Solid financial results are no longer sufficient Stakeholders are demanding more They want to know about nonfinancial results and the intangibles that will ensure financial growth They want increased reporting and transparency and insight into an organizations strategy risks and operations along with an understanding of the manner in which business is conducted As with the quality movement of the mid1980s to early 1990s these stakeholder demands are becoming baseline expectations

Compliance and ethics practices can no longer be viewed in isolation of the rest of the organization as some function off to the side to keep an organization out of jail It must become part of the overall business strategy and operations pervasive throughout the entire organization Ultimately taking this integrated approach will lead to better overall performance and compliance will become less of a burden on the business

Thessaloniki Underwater Artery
The Underwater Artery  in Thessaloniki Greece is a planned multilane stretch of expressway along the seafront of the city and 
underneath the seabed Its purpose is to alleviate traffic problems within the city center

Proposals for the construction of the Underwater Artery have received heated debate since at least the early 90s Proponents suggest that the project will create a bypass for most of the EastWest car traffic which currently has to cross the congested city centre given that Thessaloniki is especially linear as a city Opponents cite the high construction cost question the efficacy of such a solution and voice concerns about effects on the urban environment

The contracts between the State and the contractor were signed on October 31 2006 They 
were ratified by the Parliament on February 8 2007

The project has a budget of 472 million euro of which 665 million are to be provided by public and the rest by private funding The operation of tolls will be granted to the contractor for a period of 30 years the toll fee has been set at 090 euro

The road is planned as a 6lane expressway with a length of 65 kilometres of which 4 kilometres will be in a tunnel The roof of the tunnel will be at least one meter underneath the seabed The western end will be at the port area and the eastern end will be close to the Makedonia Pallas hotel

Upon the completion of the works Leoforos Nikis the seafront avenue which currently receives heavy eastward traffic is to be pedestrianised

Agua Caliente Racetrack
The Agua Caliente Racetrack current name Caliente Hipdromo is a greyhound racing and former horse racing track in Tijuana Baja California Mexico It opened in December 1929 at a cost of 25 million

One year before the Agua Caliente Casino and Hotel opened in June 1928

Now the largest branch of the Caliente casino chain the renovated building houses a casino with race betting hundreds of slot machines a restaurant and a Starbucks caf The complex includes the Estadio Caliente sports and concert stadium

Like the resort the racetrack was designed by Wayne McAllister and built by wealthy Americans Baron Long a Los Angeles nightclub owner Wirt Bowman owner of the Tijuana gambling establishment The Foreign Club and James Croffroth a member of the local Tijuana horseracing establishment Some sources note the fourth partner was Abelardo L Rodrguez Military Commander and Governor of Baja California and future President of Mexico The lavish resort and racetrack on the Mexican border was popular among Americans particularly Hollywood celebrities because drinking gambling and horse racing were still illegal in most of the neighboring US states The first manager of the track was Tommy Gorman who had previously been involved in ice hockey

Although President Lzaro Crdenas outlawed gambling in 1935 and closed the resort and casino the Agua Caliente Racetrack continued to operate for many years It was the site of several industry firsts including starting gates safety helmets and pick six wagering Both Phar Lap and Seabiscuit ran and won the Agua Caliente Handicap which for a time was the richest in North America

Such riders as Aureliano Noguez Humberto Enriquez Francisco Mena Antonio Castanon and David Flores graced the jockeys quarters throughout the days of horse racing

The race track is the originator of the Pick 6 on the North American continent Then known as the 510 and later on the 49er Some racetrackers called it the Big Six

The original grandstand structure was destroyed by fire in 1971 but was rebuilt and continues to operate today though just a shadow of its opulent beginnings It is currently owned by millionaire politician Jorge Hank who renamed it Hipdromo de Agua Caliente It has not hosted horse racing since 1992 but presents greyhound races The building was renovated in the 2010s and the Estadio Caliente stadium was built in the grounds

Memory work
Memory work is a process of engaging with the past which has both an ethical and historical dimension

The premise for memory work or travail de memoire is that history is not memory We try to represent the past in the present through memory history and the archives As Paul Ricoeur argued memory alone is fallible Historical accounts are always partial and potentially misrepresent since historians do not work with bare uninterpreted facts Historians construct and use archives that contain traces of the past However historians and librarians determine which traces are preserved and stored This is an interpretive activity Historians pose questions to which the archives responds leading them to facts that can be asserted in singular discrete propositions that usually include dates places proper names and verbs of action or condition Individuals remember events and experiences some of which they share with a collective Through mutual reconstruction and recounting collective memory is reconstructed Individuals are born into familial discourse which already provides a backdrop of communal memories against which individual memories are shaped A groups communal memory becomes its common knowledge which creates a social bond a sense of belonging and identity Professional historians attempt to corroborate correct or refute collective memory Memory work then entails adding an ethical component which acknowledges the responsibility towards revisiting distorted histories thereby decreasing the risk of social exclusion and increasing the possibility of social cohesion of atrisk groups

The concept of memorywork as distinguished from historyasmemory finds a textbook case in the Vichy Syndrome as described by Rousso His title uses medical lexicon to refer to historymemory as dependent on working consciously with unconscious memories to revise accounts of history This calls for an expanded archive that includes the oral and popular tradition as well as the written traditions normally associated with the archives

Pierre Nora introduced lieu de mmoire about 25 years ago he traced the surge in memory work at the level of the nationstate to the revisiting of distorted histories of the antiSemitic Vichy France 19401944 following the death of Charles de Gaulle in 1970 Structural changes resulted from the end of the peasantry and the dramatic economic slump as oil prices worldwide rose in 1974 Added to this was the intellectual collapse of Marxism precipitated in part by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyns Gulag Archipelago which forced the French to rethink attitudes towards the past Lieu de mmoire closed down perspectives to better understand cultural memory instead of opening up perspectives He associated memory with place and location

During memory work the process of producing an image or what we refer to as the production of the imaginary is central Therefore the key in the analysis of remembered history are contradictions

After meeting at Yale University in 1966 Jacques Derrida was a colleague and friend of Paul de Mans until de Mans death in 1983 In 1984 Derrida gave three lectures including one at Yale University on the art of memory In Memoriesfor Paul de Man described the relationship between memory work and deconstruction in this oftencited passage

Barbara Gabriel provided a model for reading the complexities of memory and forgetting by situating unheimlich within the heimlich in a Freudian one within the other structure As point of departure Gabriel examined Edgar Reitzs elevenpart West German television series entitled Heimat Reitz work was in response to a larger movement in Germany national memory work provoked in part by an American television series entitled the Holocaust followed viewed by millions As European art in general and German art in particular resurged in the 1960s artists like Gnter Grass and Edgar Reitz captured international attention as they grappled with issues of identity in a divided postHolocaust Germany Gabriel developed the concept of an impulse towards national memory work in Germany that stemmed from a haunted subject yearning for a lost far away nostalgic place a utopic homeland How do we confront that which we have excluded in order to be whether it is the return of the repressed or the return of the strangers In other words that which we fear as other is within ourselves through our shared humanity Repressed memories haunt all of us

After attending a memory methodology workshop in Cape Town South Africa in 2005 on forced removal traumas Australian performance artist Tanya Heyward created a performance piece called Site in Melbourne Watch House in 2006 She referred to a burial ground at Prestwich Street Cape Town South Africa with three thousand skeletons dating back to Dutch colonization the largest of its kind in the South Africa

The concept of memory work is part of a sociological imagination from a postnational point of view Expanding on Norbert Loeffler The idea of one national history is only acceptable as a question not as an answer

Memory work is related to identity work often associated with displaced persons Some of the most provocative research on memory work has been authored by the Piednoir or French colonials in Algeria who returned to France following the Algerian War Examples of such thinkers include Jacques Derrida and Hlne Cixous Another major writer in this field Julia Kristeva also moved away from the country of her birth having emigrated to France from Bulgaria when she was 24

California mule deer
The California mule deer Odocoileus hemionus californicus is a subspecies of mule deer whose range covers much of the state of California

One of the principal means of distinguishing the closely related blacktailed deer and whitetailed deer is the growth habit of the bucks antlers In the case of the California mule deer the antlers fork in an upward growth whereas the other species antlers grow in a forward direction

This subspecies O h californicus is widespread throughout northern and central California in the California coastal prairie as well as inner coastal ranges and interior mountains especially the Sierra Nevada This deer is much less frequently found on the floor of the interior valleys and then mostly frequently in riparian zones

Generally the California mule deer has a preference for hill terrain especially an oak woodland habitat It is a browser and typically takes over 90 of its diet from shrubs and leaves and the balance from grasses

California mule deer usually browse close to lakes or streams providing their water From that water source they may roam 12mi and typically make their beds in grassy areas beneath trees within such a onemile radius from both water and forage

Repeatedly used beds often are scratched to a nearly level surface about 2 m in diameter Less regularly used bedding areas are seen as flattened grass On hot summer days California mule deer often seek shade and rest in the midday

In summer California mule deer mainly browse on leaves of small trees shrubs and herbaceous plants but also consume many types of berries including blackberry huckleberry salal and thimbleberry In winter they may expand their forage to conifers particularly twigs of Douglas fir aspen willow dogwood juniper and sage Yearround they feed on acorns grasses are a secondary food source Where humans have encroached on historic deer habitat by suburban development or orchards California mule deer diversify their diet with garden plant material tree fruit and occasionally pet food

Fawns and does tend to forage together in familial groupings while bucks tend to travel singly or with other bucks California mule deer browse most actively near dawn and dusk but also forage at night in open agricultural areas or when experiencing hunting pressure
Rutting season occurs in autumn when the does come into estrus for a period lasting only several days Males exhibit aggressive behavior in competing for mates Does begin estrus again if they do not become pregnant The gestation period is about 200 days with fawns arriving in the spring the young remain with mothers throughout the summer and are weaned in the autumn The bucks antlers fall off in the winter and commence growing once more in spring in anticipation of next autumns rut

Since prehistoric times the Native American indigenous peoples of California are known to have hunted California mule deer Thus since about 12000 BCE Gage suggests that human populations have served as a control to the numbers of California mule deer

In the modern era since European colonists and EuroAmericans settled in California hunting pressure intensified as the human population expanded and hunting became an activity not just associated with food supply In addition human population growth through urban development in California has consumed large amounts of natural habitat of the California mule deer starting in the late 19th century and continuing through the present

David Langford has called it a pleasant little novel and engaging while qualifying it as only just fantasy James Nicoll has cited it as an example of how perception of a book can be affected by historical context noting that when he reread it in 2014 it was still an often charming period piece just not as charming as it was when he originally read it in 1983 in particular he emphasizes that it isnt quite an example of the white savior trope but this book can see white savior from where it is standing Similarly Jo Walton while praising MacAvoys approach to the novels central philosophical questions  states that she remembers being excited by what seems to me today in 2010 to be charming but quite slight and posits that a great deal of the popularity and acclaim came from how lovely it is and the rest of it came from how amazingly unusual it was in 1983 to have a fantasy novel using Chinese mythology and with a Chinese protagonist

Daughters of Abraham
The Daughters of Abraham is an interfaith book group consisting of Jewish Christian and Muslim women Its mission is to overcome stereotypes and to foster mutual respect and understanding among Jewish Christian and Muslim women

The first group was founded in Cambridge Massachusetts United States in 2002 Groups then formed in Cambridge Newton Massachusetts Chestnut Hill Massachusetts at Boston College and Washington DC

The purpose is to increase respect for all of the Abrahamic religions by reading books that teach about faith traditions and the practice of the respective faiths The group members are committed to building relationships with each other Daughters of Abraham is not a dialogue group but a book group focused on discussions of books that explore the three faith traditions

Any Jewish Christian or Muslim woman who shares the Daughters purpose can join

The Daughters of Abraham was the inspiration of Edie Howe She attended an interfaith service on the evening of September 11 2001 and sat with Jewish Christian and Muslim women Looking around she wondered what she could do to respond to the tragic events of that day She decided to form a book group of women from the three Abrahamic faiths This first group has been meeting since September 2002

In all three of the religious traditions Abraham is revered as the first monotheist In this sense he is the father and the members can be thought of as his daughters Even though they are daughters of different mothers Sarah and Hagar Abraham is the father of all three religions By naming themselves Abrahams daughters the group members are saying that there is more holding them together than separating them

Group members listen and speak respectfully to one another do not to monopolize the conversation and speak from personal experience rather than making sweeping statements

Members suggest books at the meetings Periodically they review all the suggestions then by consensus choose the books that will be read If anyone strongly objects to reading a particular book it is not read

HctorNeri Castaeda
HctorNeri Castaeda December 13 1924  September 7 1991 was a Guatemalan philosopher and founder of the journal Nos

Born in San Vicente Zacapa Guatemala he emigrated to the United States in 1948 and studied under Wilfrid Sellars at the University of Minnesota where he earned a BA in 1950 and MA in 1952 Castaeda received his PhD in June 1954 for his dissertation The Logical Structure of Moral Reasoning He studied at Oxford University from 19551956 after which he once again returned to the US to take a sabbaticalreplacement position in philosophy at Duke University Castaeda is noted for his development of guise theory which he applied to outstanding problems in the analysis of thought language and the structure of the world He is also credited with the discovery of the quasiindicator or quasiindexical a linguistic device by which one person can attribute an indexical reference to another His discussion on this matter strongly influenced John Perrys theory of indexicals an influence which Perry acknowledged in the first footnote of the paper The Problem of the Essential Indexical

He died of a brain tumor in 1991

Following his brief stay at Duke University Castaedas first fulltime academic appointment was as a professor in the Philosophy department at Wayne State University where he taught from 19571969 It was there that he founded the philosophical journal Nos in 1967 From 19621963 he was also a visiting professor at the University of Texas at Austin He was granted a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation between 1967 and 1968

He moved to Indiana University in 1969 and eventually became the Mahlon Powell Professor of Philosophy as well as that universitys first Dean of Latino Affairs a position he held from 19781981 He was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences from 19811982

In addition to his other academic honors Castaeda received grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities the Andrew W Mellon Foundation and the National Science Foundation He served as President of the American Philosophical Association Central Division from 19791980 and was named to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990 Castaeda was awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor by the Government of Guatemala in 1991

Castaeda started from the fact that thoughts about real things in the world are of a fundamentally similar nature to thoughts about things in the imagination it is still a thought and from there he hypothesized an entire realm of abstract objects that included both the real and the imagined He referred to these objects collectively as guises and argued that they could be treated as sets of properties He went on to analyse all of language and perception in terms of these guises ultimately developing an entire metaphysics based on them

One noted critic of guise theory was Plantinga who developed his own rival theory involving a realm of abstract objects Both theories were in fact based on even earlier work developed by Ernst Mally in 1912 They differed however in the details of their metaphysical system and in how they regarded the basic building blocks of their respective systems

Charles F Hurley
Charles Francis Hurley November 24 1893  March 24 1946 was the 54th Governor of the US state of Massachusetts and one of its first IrishAmerican governors

Charles Francis Hurley was born in Cambridge Massachusetts to John and Elizabeth Maker Hurley He attended public schools in Cambridge then Boston College High School and then studied for two years at Boston College He became a salesman for athletic goods and entered the United States Navy in the First World War serving in a radio intelligence unit stationed at Harvard University After the war Hurley entered the real estate business in partnership with James M Conley In 1924 he married Conleys daughter Marion the couple had five children

Hurleys entry into politics was in 1919 when he won election to the Cambridge school committee on which he served until 1931 
Governor Hurleys administration was a brief departure from the increasing ethnic conflict between Yankee Protestants and IrishAmerican Catholics in political machines party control and business influence which had marked the states early 20th century history In 1930 he ran as a Democrat for the position of Massachusetts State Treasurer winning three consecutive twoyear terms In 1936 he won the nomination for Governor James Michael Curley the Democratic incumbent was seeking a Senate seat and then won the general election defeating Republican John W Haigis

As a result of immigration in the late 19th and early 20th century the predominant power of the native American classes had first eroded in Boston and then the state with brief checks and restoration of Yankee power in the interim While Irish immigration had been reduced to a trickle with the Immigration Act of 1924 further immigration was negligible and the state turned to a process of assimilation and competition between the two groups for remaining power Hurley represented the more legitimate side to Irish American politics and he attempted to prove the Americanization of his ethnic community by turning away from ethnic spoils which had marked his previous predecessors Included amongst his program of cleaning up the civil service were the regulation of labor practices and emphasis on individual rights 

During Governor Hurleys administration the Fair Trades Laws were passed which regulated the use of private police in strikes imposed a minimum wage for women and children and further regulated industrial work While these practices endeared him to both ethnic groups his administration also marked a departure from past practices with its increasing liberalism Although both Yankee and Irish American voters had favored it he vetoed a law to require teachers to take loyalty oaths Additionally he raised the ire of Georgias Governor Eurith D Rivers by refusing to extradite James Cunningham who had escaped from a Georgia chain gang thirteen years earlier Hurley further upset Yankee and Irish interests which had a long tradition of local representative democracy when he also approved a fifth form of municipal government in Massachusetts called Plan E This allowed for an appointed city manager and a city council drawn from a proportional representation of the vote rather than a collection of majority elected precinct candidates Yankee interests in several cities such as Boston had cherished their old Charter government from both historical precedence and the ability of ward representatives in protecting their interests in the majority Irish American city The later in turn had long used the form of government in defending their interests when they were a minority and saw its abolition as a direct threat to their way of conducting business

Faced with a reinvigorated Yankee political machine and a loss of support amongst his own constituents particularly the still powerful Irish mob Hurley was denied reelection when former Governor Curley won the 1938 Democratic gubernatorial nomination

He returned to private life serving as a trustee of the Cambridge Public Library from 1941 until his death He died on March 24 1946

The Charles F Hurley Building in Bostons Government Center complex is named after him

Criticism of communist party rule
The actions by governments of communist states have been subject to criticism According to critics the rule by Communist parties leads to totalitarianism political repression restrictions of human rights poor economic performance and cultural and artistic censorship

After the Russian Revolution communist party rule was consolidated for the first time in Soviet Russia later the largest constituent republic of the Soviet Union formed in December 1922 and criticized immediately domestically and internationally During the first Red Scare in the United States the takeover of Russia by the communist Bolsheviks was considered by many a threat to free markets religious freedom and liberal democracy Meanwhile under the tutelage of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union the only party permitted by the Soviet Union constitution state institutions were intimately entwined with those of the party By the late 1920s Joseph Stalin consolidated the regimes control over the countrys economy and society through a system of economic planning and fiveyear plans

Between the Russian Revolution and the Second World War Sovietstyle communist rule only spread to one state that was not later incorporated into the Soviet Union In 1924 communist rule was established in neighboring Mongolia a traditional outpost of Russian influence bordering the Siberian region However throughout much of Europe and the Americas criticism of the domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet regime among anticommunists continued unabated After the end of World War II Soviet Union took control over the territories reached by the Red Army establishing what later became known as Eastern Bloc

Following the Chinese Revolution the Peoples Republic of China was proclaimed in 1949 under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party Between the Chinese Revolution and the last quarter of the 20th century communist rule spread throughout East Asia and much of the Third World and new communist regimes became the subject of extensive local and international criticism

Western criticisms of the Soviet Union and Third World communist regimes have been strongly anchored in scholarship on totalitarianism which asserts that communist parties maintain themselves in power without the consent of the populations and they rule by means of secret police propaganda disseminated through the statecontrolled mass media repression of free discussion and criticism mass surveillance and state terror These studies of totalitarianism influenced Western historiography on communism and Soviet history particularly the work of Robert Conquest and Richard Pipes on Stalinism the Great Purge the Gulag and the Soviet famine of 19321933 Western criticisms of communist rule have also been grounded in criticisms of socialism by economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman who argued that the state ownership and economic planning characteristic of Sovietstyle communist rule were responsible for economic stagnation and shortage economies providing few incentives for individuals to improve productivity and engage in entrepreneurship

Ruling communist parties have also been challenged by domestic dissent In Eastern Europe the works of dissidents Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Vclav Havel gained international prominence as did the works of disillusioned excommunists such as Milovan Djilas who condemned the new class or nomenklatura system that had emerged under communist rule Communism Promise and Practice 1973 detailed what its author termed flagrant gaps between official Soviet policies of equality and economic justice and the reality of the emergence of a new class in the Soviet Union and in other communist countries which thrived at the expense of the remaining population

Criticisms of communist regimes have centered on many topics including their effects on the economic development human rights foreign policy scientific progress and environmental degradation of the countries they rule

Political repression is a topic in many influential works critical of communist rule including Robert Conquests accounts of Stalins Great Purge in The Great Terror and the Soviet famine of 19321933 in The Harvest of Sorrow Richard Pipes account of the Red Terror during the Russian Civil War RJ Rummels work on democide Aleksandr Solzhenitsyns account of Stalins forced labor camps in The Gulag Archipelago and Stphane Courtois account of executions forced labor camps and mass starvation in communist regimes as a general category with particular attention to the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin and China under Mao Zedong

Sovietstyle central planning and state ownership has been another topic of criticism of communist rule Works by economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman argue that the economic structures associated with communist rule resulted in economic stagnation Other topics of criticism of communist rule include foreign policies of expansionism environmental degradation and the suppression of free cultural expression

Largescale political repression under communist rule has been the subject of extensive historical research by scholars and activists from a diverse range of perspectives A number of researchers on this subject are former Eastern bloc communists who become disillusioned with their ruling parties such as Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev and Dmitri Volkogonov Similarly Jung Chang one of the authors of  was a Red Guard in her youth Others are disillusioned former Western communists including several of the authors of The Black Book of Communism Robert Conquest another former communist became one of the bestknown writers on the Soviet Union following the publication of his influential account of the Great Purge in The Great Terror which at first was not well received in some leftleaning circles of Western intellectuals Following the end of the Cold War much of the research on this topic has focused on state archives previously classified under communist rule

The level of political repression experienced in states under communist rule varied widely between different countries and historical periods The most rigid censorship was practiced by the Soviet Union under Stalin 19221953 China under Mao during the Cultural Revolution 19661976 and the communist regime in North Korea throughout its rule 1948present Under Stalins rule political repression in the Soviet Union included executions of Great Purge victims and peasants deemed kulaks by state authorities the Gulag system of forced labor camps deportations of ethnic minorities and mass starvations during the Soviet famine of 19321933 caused by either government mismanagement or by some accounts caused deliberately The Black Book of Communism also details the mass starvations resulting from Great Leap Forward in China and the Killing Fields in Cambodia

Although political repression in the Soviet Union was far more extensive and severe in its methods under Stalins rule than in any other period authors such as Richard Pipes Orlando Figes and works such as the Black Book of Communism argue that a reign of terror began within Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin immediately after the October Revolution and continued by the Red Army and the Cheka over the country during the Russian Civil War It included summary executions of hundreds of thousands of class enemies by Cheka the development of the system of labor camps which would later lay the foundation for the Gulags and a policy of food requisitioning during the civil war which was partially responsible for a famine causing three to ten million deaths

Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlevs critiques of political repression under communist rule focus on the treatment of children which he numbers in the millions of alleged political opponents His accounts stress cases in which children of former imperial officers and peasants were held as hostages and sometimes shot during the civil war His account of the Second World War highlights cases in which the children of soldiers who had surrendered were the victims of state reprisal Some children Yakovlev notes followed their parents to the Gulags suffering an especially high mortality rate According to Yakovlev in 1954 there were 884057 specially resettled children under the age of sixteen Others were placed in special orphanages run by the secret police in order to be reeducated often losing even their names and were considered socially dangerous as adults

Other accounts focus on extensive networks of civilian informants consisting of either volunteers or those forcibly recruited These networks were used to collect intelligence for the government and report cases of dissent Many accounts of political repression in the Soviet Union highlight cases in which internal critics were classified as mentally ill suffering from disorders such as sluggishly progressing schizophrenia and incarcerated in mental hospitals The fact that workers in the Soviet Union were not allowed to organize independent nonstate trade union has also been presented as a case of political repression in the Soviet Union

Various accounts stressing a relationship between political repression and communist rule focus on the suppression of internal uprisings by military force such as the Tambov rebellion and the Kronstadt rebellion during the Russian Civil War and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in China

Excommunist dissident Milovan Djilas among others focused on the relationship between political repression and the rise of a powerful new class of party bureaucrats that had emerged under communist rule and exploited the rest of the population see nomenklatura

Both anticommunists and communists have criticized the personality cults of many communist rulers especially the cults of Stalin Mao Fidel Castro and Kim Ilsung In the case of North Korea the personality cult of Kim Ilsung was associated with inherited leadership with the succession of Kims son Kim Jongil in 1994 and grandson Kim Jongun in 2011 Cuban communists have also been criticized for planning an inherited leadership with the succession of Ral Castro following his brothers illness in mid2006

In the literature on communist rule many anticommunists have asserted that communist regimes tend to impose harsh restrictions on the freedom of movement These restrictions they argue are meant to stem the possibility of mass emigration which threatens to offer evidence pointing to widespread popular dissatisfaction with their rule

Between 1950 and 1961 275 million East Germans moved to West Germany During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 around 200000 people moved to Austria as the HungarianAustrian border temporarily opened From 1948 to 1953 hundreds of thousands of North Koreans moved to the South stopped only when emigration was clamped down after the Korean War

In Cuba 50000 middleclass Cubans left between 1959 and 1961 after the Cuban Revolution and the breakdown of CubanAmerican relations Following a period of repressive measures by the Cuban government in the late 1960s and 1970s Cuba allowed for mass emigration of dissatisfied citizens a policy that resulted in the Mariel Boatlift of 1980 which led to a drop in emigration rates during the later months In the 1990s the economic crisis known as the Special Period coupled with the United States tightening of the embargo led to desperate attempts to leave the island on balsas rafts tires and makeshift vessels Many Cubans currently continue attempts to emigrate to the United States In total according to some estimates more than 1 million people have left Cuba around 10 of the population Between 1971 and 1998 547000 Cubans emigrated to the United States alongside 700000 neighboring Dominicans 335000 Haitians and 485000 Jamaicans Since 1966 immigration to the United States was governed by the 1966 Cuban adjustment act a United States law that applies solely to Cubans The ruling allows any Cuban national no matter the means of the entry into the United States to receive a green card after being in the country a year Havana has long argued that the policy has encouraged the illegal exodus deliberately ignoring and undervaluing the lifethreatening hardships endured by refugees

After the victory of the communist North in the Vietnam War over 2 million people in former South Vietnamese territory left the country see Vietnamese boat people in the 1970s and 1980s Another large group of refugees left Cambodia and Laos

Restrictions on emigration from states ruled by communist parties received extensive publicity In the West the Berlin wall emerged as a symbol of such restrictions During the Berlin Walls existence sixty thousand people unsuccessfully attempted to emigrate illegally from East Germany and received jail terms for such actions there were around five thousand successful escapes into West Berlin and 239 people were killed trying to cross

North Korea currently imposes strict restrictions on emigration

Albania and North Korea perhaps imposed the most extreme restrictions on emigration From most other communist regimes legal emigration was always possible though often so difficult that attempted emigrants would risk their lives in order to emigrate Some of these states relaxed emigration laws significantly from the 1960s onwards Tens of thousands of Soviet citizens emigrated legally every year during the 1970s

The Chinese government takes these restrictions even further by restriction of movement within their own borders Workers in rural areas must obtain permission to obtain work at factories within urban areas Many rural citizens especially young men facing lack of education and other services that are provided free of charge to people living in cities and urban areas choose to obtain underthetable work in urban areas where there are labor shortages leading to an illegal immigration problem within the country These restrictions are not for the political reasons other regimes have used but to maintain the central government planned economy and caste system that seeks to retain the knowledge and skills needed in different fields of the economy Agriculture Industry Fishing etc One belief is that China is trying to reduce overpopulation of urban areas and avoid the loss of specialized skills usually passed from generation to generation in the traditional fields

As an ideology MarxismLeninism stresses militant opposition to imperialism Vladimir Lenin considered imperialism the highest stage of capitalism and in 1917 made declarations of the unconditional right of selfdetermination and secession for the national minorities of Russia Later during the Cold War communist states exercised imperialism by giving military assistance and in some cases intervening directly on behalf of Communist movements that were fighting for control particularly in Asia and Africa

Western critics accused the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China of practicing imperialism themselves and communist condemnations of Western imperialism hypocritical The attack on and restoration of Moscows control of countries that had been under the rule of the tsarist empire but briefly formed newly independent states in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War including Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan have been condemned as examples of Soviet imperialism Similarly Stalins forced reassertion of Moscows rule of the Baltic states in World War II has been condemned as Soviet imperialism Western critics accused Stalin of creating satellite states in Eastern Europe after the end of World War II Western critics also condemned the intervention of Soviet forces during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution the Prague Spring and the war in Afghanistan as aggression against popular uprisings Maoists argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist faade social imperialism Chinas reassertion of central control over territories on the frontiers of the Qing dynasty particularly Tibet has also been condemned as imperialistic by some

According to Richard Pipes the Soviet Union shares some responsibility for World War II Pipes argues that both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini used the Soviet Union as a model for their own regimes and that Hitler privately considered Stalin a genius According to Pipes Stalin privately hoped that another world war would weaken his foreign enemies and allow him to assert Soviet power internationally Before Hitler took power Stalin allowed the testing and production of German weapons that were forbidden by the Versailles Treaty to occur on Soviet territory Stalin is also accused of weakening German opposition to the Nazis before Hitlers rule began in 1933 During the 1932 German elections for instance he forbade the German Communists from collaborating with the Social Democrats These parties together gained more votes than Hitler and some have later surmised could have prevented him from becoming Chancellor

Some states under communist rule have been criticized for directly supporting terrorist groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine the Red Army Faction and the Japanese Red Army North Korea has been implicated in terrorist acts such as Korean Air Flight 858

A number of communist states also held forced labor as a legal form of punishment for certain periods of time and again critics of these policies assert that many of those sentenced to forced labor camps such as the Gulag were sent there for political rather than criminal reasons Some of the Gulag camps were located in very harsh environments such as Siberia which resulted in the death of a significant fraction of inmates before they could complete their prison terms Officially the Gulag was shut down in 1960 though they remained de facto in action for some time after

Many deaths were also caused by involuntary deportations of entire ethnic groups see population transfer in the Soviet Union Many Prisoners of War taken during World War II were not released as the war ended and died in the Gulags Many German civilians died as a result of atrocities committed by the Soviet army see Evacuation of East Prussia and due to the policy of ethnic cleansing of Germans from the territories they lost due to the war see expulsion of Germans after World War II

North Korea continues to maintain a network of prison and labor camps that imprison an estimated 200000 people While the country does not regularly deport citizens there is a system of internal exile and banishment

Scholars such as Stephane Courtois Steven Rosefielde in Red Holocaust Banjamin Valentino and RJ Rummel have argued that communist regimes were responsible for tens or even hundreds of millions of deaths These deaths mostly occurred under the rule of Stalin and Mao therefore these particular periods of communist rule in Russia and China receive considerable attention in The Black Book of Communism though other communist regimes have also caused high number of deaths not least the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia which is often acclaimed to have killed more of its citizens than any other in history

These accounts often divide their death toll estimates into two categories

In most communist states the death penalty was a legal form of punishment for most of their existence with a few exceptions The Soviet Union for example formally abolished the death penalty between 1947 and 1950 though this did nothing to curb executions and acts of genocide Critics argue that many of the convicted prisoners executed by authorities under communist rule were not criminals but political dissidents Stalins Great Purge in the late 1930s from roughly 19361938 is given as the most prominent example of the hypothesis

With regard to deaths not caused directly by state or party authorities The Black Book of Communism points to famine and war as the indirect causes of what they see as deaths for which communist regimes were responsible In this sense the Soviet famine of 19321933 and the Great Leap Forward are often described as manmade famines These two events alone killed a majority of the people seen as victims of communist states by estimates such as Courtois Courtois also blames Mengistu Haile Mariams regime in Ethiopia for having exacerbated the 19831985 famine by imposing unreasonable political and economic burdens on the population

The authors of the Black Book of Communism RJ Rummel Norman Davies and others have attempted to give estimates of the total number of deaths for which communist rule of a particular state in a particular period was responsible or the total for all states under communist rule The question is complicated by the lack of hard data and by biases inherent in any estimation

The number of people killed under Joseph Stalins rule in the Soviet Union by 1939 has been estimated as 358 million by G Ponton 66 million by VV Tsaplin and 1011 million by Alec Nove The number of people killed under Stalins rule by the time of his death in 1953 has been estimated as 13 million by Stephen G Wheatcroft 69 million by Timothy D Snyder 1320 million by Steven Rosefielde 20 million by The Black Book of Communism 20 to 25 million by Alexander Yakovlev 43 million by RJ Rummel and 50 million by Norman Davies

The number of people killed under Maos rule in the Peoples Republic of China has been estimated at 195 million by Wang Weizhi 27 million by John Heidenrich between 38 and 67 million by Kurt Glaser and Stephan Possony between 32 and 59 million by Robert L Walker 50 million by Steven Rosefielde 65 million by The Black Book of Communism well over 70 million by  and 77 million by RJ Rummel

The authors of The Black Book of Communism have also estimated that 93 million people were killed under communist rule in other states 2 million in North Korea 2 million in Cambodia 17 million in Africa 15 million in Afghanistan 1 million in Vietnam 1 million in Eastern Europe and 150000 in Latin America RJ Rummel has estimated that 17 million were killed by the government of Vietnam 16 million in North Korea not counting the 1990s famine 2 million in Cambodia and 25 million in Poland and Yugoslavia Valentino estimates that 1 to 2 million were killed in Cambodia 50000 to 100000 in Bulgaria 80000 to 100000 in East Germany 60000 to 300000 in Romania 400000 to 1500000 in North Korea and 80000 to 200000 in North and South Vietnam

Between the authors Wiezhi Heidenrich Glaser Possony Ponton Tsaplin and Nove Stalins Soviet Union and Maos China have an estimated total death rate ranging from 23 million to 109 million

The Black Book of Communism asserts that roughly 94 million died under all communist regimes while Rummel believes around 1447 million died under six communist regimes Benjamin Valentino claims that between 21 and 70 million deaths are attributable to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union the Peoples Republic of China and Democratic Kampuchea alone

Jasper Becker author of Hungry Ghosts claims that if the death tolls from the famines caused by communist regimes in China the Soviet Union Cambodia North Korea Ethiopia and Mozambique are added together the figure could be close to 90 million

These estimates are the three highest numbers of victims blamed on communism by any notable study However the totals that include research by Wiezhi Heidenrich Glasser Possony Ponton Tsaplin and Nove do not include other periods of time beyond Stalin or Maos rule thus it may possible when including other communist states to reach higher totals

In a January 25 2006 resolution condemning the crimes of communist regimes the Council of Europe cited the 94 million total reached by the authors of the Black Book of Communism

Explanations have been offered for the discrepancies in the number of estimated victims of communist regimes

Both critics and supporters of communist rule often make comparisons between the economic development of countries under communist rule and noncommunist countries with the intention of certain economic structures are superior to the other All such comparisons are open to challenge both on the comparability of the states involved and the statistics being used for comparison No two countries are identical which makes comparisons regarding later economic development difficult Western Europe was more developed and industrialized than Eastern Europe long before the Cold War World War II damaged the economies of some countries more than others and East Germany had much of its industry dismantled and moved to the Soviet Union for war reparations

Advocates of Sovietstyle economic planning have claimed the system has in certain instances produced dramatic advances including rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union especially during the 1930s Critics of Soviet economic planning in response assert that new research shows that the Soviet figures were partly fabricated especially those showing extremely high growth in the Stalin era Growth was impressive in the 1950s and 1960s in some estimates much higher than during the 1930s but later declined and according to some estimates became negative in the late 1980s Before collectivization Russia had been the breadbasket of Europe Afterwards the Soviet Union became a net importer of grain unable to produce enough food to feed its own population

China and Vietnam achieved much higher rates of growth after introducing market reforms see socialism with Chinese characteristics starting in the late 1970s and 1980shigher growth rates were accompanied by declining poverty

The communist states do not compare favorably when looking at nations divided by the Cold War North Korea versus South Korea and East Germany versus West Germany East German productivity relative to West German productivity was around 90 percent in 1936 and around 6065 percent in 1954 When compared to Western Europe East German productivity declined from 67 percent in 1950 to 50 percent before the reunification in 1990 All the Eastern European national economies had productivity far below the Western European average

Nevertheless some countries under communist rule with socialist economies maintained consistently higher rates of economic growth than industrialized Western countries with capitalist economies From 1928 to 1985 the economy of the Soviet Union grew by a factor of 10 and GNP per capita grew more than fivefold The Soviet economy started out at roughly 25 percent the size of the economy of the United States By 1955 it climbed to 40 percent In 1965 the Soviet economy reached 50 of the contemporary United States economy and in 1977 it passed the 60 percent threshold For the first half of the Cold War most economists were asking when not if the Soviet economy would overtake the United States economy Starting in the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s growth rates slowed down in the Soviet Union and throughout the socialist bloc The reasons for this downturn are still a matter of debate among economists but one hypothesis is that the socialist planned economies had reached the limits of the extensive growth model they were pursuing and the downturn was at least in part caused by their refusal or inability to switch to intensive growth Further it could be argued that since the economies of countries such as Russia were preindustrial before the socialist revolutions the high economic growth rate could be attributed to industrialization Also while forms of economic growth associated with any economic structure produce some winners and losers anticommunists point out that high growth rates under communist rule were associated with particularly intense suffering and even mass starvation of the peasant population
Unlike the slow market reforms in China and Vietnam where communist rule continues the abrupt end to central planning was followed by a depression in many of the states of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe which chose to adopt the socalled economic shock therapy For example in the Russian Federation GDP per capita decreased by onethird between 1989 and 1996 As of 2003 all of them have positive economic growth and almost all have a higher GDPcapita than before the transition

In general critics of communist rule argue that socialist economies remained behind the industrialized West in terms of economic development for most of their existence while others assert that socialist economies had growth rates that were sometimes higher than many nonsocialist economies so they would have eventually caught up to the West if those growth rates had been maintained Some reject all comparisons altogether noting that the communist states started out with economies that were generally much less developed to begin with

Starting with the first fiveyear plan in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s and early 1930s Soviet leaders pursued a strategy of economic development concentrating the countrys economic resources on heavy industry and defense rather than on consumer goods This strategy was later adopted in varying degrees by communist leaders in Eastern Europe and the Third World For many Western critics of communist strategies of economic development the unavailability of consumer goods common in the West in the Soviet Union was a case in point of how communist rule resulted in lower standards of living

The allegation that communist rule resulted in lower standards of living sharply contrasted with communist arguments boasting of the achievements of the social and cultural programs of the Soviet Union and other communist states For instance Soviet leaders boasted of guaranteed employment subsidized food and clothing free health care free child care and free education Soviet leaders also touted early advances in womens equality particularly in Islamic areas of Soviet Central Asia Eastern European communists often touted high levels of literacy in comparison with many parts of the developing world A phenomenon called Ostalgie nostalgia for life under Soviet rule has been noted amongst former members of Communist countries now living in Western capitalist states particularly those who lived in the former East Germany

However the effects of communist rule on living standards have been harshly criticized Jung Chang stresses that millions died in famines in communist China and North Korea Some studies conclude that East Germans were shorter than West Germans probably due to differences in factors such as nutrition and medical services According to some researchers life satisfaction increased in East Germany after the reunification Critics of Soviet rule charge that the Soviet education system was full of propaganda and of low quality United States government researchers pointed out the fact that the Soviet Union spent far less on health care than Western nations and noted that the quality of Soviet health care was deteriorating in the 1970s and 1980s In addition the failure of Soviet pension and welfare programs to provide adequate protection was noted in the West

After 1965 life expectancy began to plateau or even decrease especially for males in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe while it continued to increase in Western Europe This divergence between two parts of Europe continued over the course of three decades leading to a profound gap in the mid1990s Life expectancy sharply declined after the change to market economy in most of the states of the former Soviet Union but may now have started to increase in the Baltic states In several Eastern European nations life expectancy started to increase immediately after the fall of communism The previous decline for males continued for a time in some Eastern European nations like Romania before starting to increase

In The Politics of Bad Faith David Horowitz painted a picture of horrendous living standards in the Soviet Union Horowitz claimed that in the 1980s rationing of meat and sugar was common in the Soviet Union Horowitz cited studies suggesting the average intake of red meat for a Soviet citizen was half of what it had been for a subject of the tsar in 1913 that blacks under apartheid in South Africa owned more cars per capita and that the average welfare mother in the United States received more income in a month than the average Soviet worker could earn in a year According to Horowitz the only area of consumption in which the Soviets excelled was the ingestion of hard liquor Horowitz also noted that twothirds of the households had no hot water and a third had no running water at all Horowitz cited the government newspaper Izvestia noting a typical workingclass family of four was forced to live for eight years in a single eight by eight foot room before marginally better accommodation became available In his discussion of the Soviet housing shortage Horowitz stated that the shortage was so acute that at all times 17 percent of Soviet families had to be physically separated for want of adequate space A third of the hospitals had no running water and the bribery of doctors and nurses to get decent medical attention and even amenities like blankets in Soviet hospitals was not only common but routine In his discussion of Soviet education Horowitz stated that only 15 percent of Soviet youth were able to attend institutions of higher learning compared to 34 percent in the United States However large segments of citizens of many former communist today states say that the standard of living has fallen since the end of the Cold War with majorities of citizens in the former East Germany and Romania were polled as saying that life was better under Communism

In terms of living standards economist Michael Ellman asserts that in international comparisons state socialist nations compared favorably with capitalist nations in health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy Amartya Sens own analysis of international comparisons of life expectancy found that several communist countries made significant gains and commented one thought that is bound to occur is that communism is good for poverty removal Poverty exploded following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 tripling to more than onethird of Russias population in just three years

Criticisms of communist rule have often centered on the censorship of the arts In the case of the Soviet Union these criticisms often deal with the preferential treatment afforded to socialist realism Other criticisms center on the largescale cultural experiments of certain communist regimes In Romania the historical center of Bucharest was demolished and the whole city was redesigned between 1977 and 1989 In the Soviet Union hundreds of churches were demolished or converted to secular purposes during the 1920s and 1930s In China the Cultural Revolution sought to give all artistic expression a proletarian content and destroyed much older material lacking this Advocates of these policies promised to create a new culture that would be superior to the old while critics argue that such policies represented an unjustifiable destruction of the cultural heritage of humanity

There is a wellknown literature focusing on the role of the falsification of images in the Soviet Union under Stalin In The Commissar Vanishes The Falsification of Photographs in Stalins Russia David King writes So much falsification took place during the Stalin years that it is possible to tell the story of the Soviet era through retouched photographs Under Stalin historical documents were often the subject of revisionism and forgery intended to change public perception of certain important people and events For example the pivotal role played by Leon Trotsky in the Russian Revolution and Civil War was almost entirely erased from official historical records after Trotsky became the leader of a Communist faction that opposed Stalins rule

The emphasis on the hard sciences of the Soviet Union has been criticized There were very few Nobel Prize winners from Communist states

Soviet research in certain sciences was at times guided by political rather than scientific considerations Lysenkoism and Japhetic theory were promoted for brief periods of time in biology and linguistics respectively despite having no scientific merit Research into genetics was restricted because Nazi use of eugenics had prompted the Soviet Union to label genetics a fascist science Research was also suppressed in cybernetics psychology and psychiatry and even organic chemistry see suppressed research in the Soviet Union

Soviet technology in many sectors lagged Western technology Exceptions include areas like the Soviet space program and military technology where occasionally Communist technology was more advanced due to a massive concentration of research resources According to the Central Intelligence Agency much of the technology in the Communist states consisted simply of copies of Western products that had been legally purchased or gained through a massive espionage program Some even say that stricter Western control of the export of technology through the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls and providing defective technology to Communist agents after the discovery of the Farewell Dossier contributed to the fall of Communism

Other criticisms of Communist rule focus on environmental disasters One example is the gradual disappearance of the Aral Sea and a similar diminishing of the Caspian Sea because of the diversion of the rivers that fed them Another is the pollution of the Black Sea the Baltic Sea and the unique freshwater environment of Lake Baikal Many of the rivers were polluted and several like the Vistula and Oder rivers in Poland were virtually ecologically dead Over 70 percent of the surface water in the Soviet Union was polluted In 1988 only 30 percent of the sewage in the Soviet Union was treated properly Established health standards for air pollution was exceeded by ten times or more in 103 cities in the Soviet Union in 1988 The air pollution problem was even more severe in Eastern Europe It caused a rapid growth in lung cancer forest dieback and damage to buildings and cultural heritages According to official sources 58 percent of total agricultural land of the former Soviet Union was affected by salinization erosion acidity or waterlogging Nuclear waste was dumped in the Sea of Japan the Arctic Ocean and in locations in the Far East It was revealed in 1992 that in the city of Moscow there were 636 radioactive toxic waste sites and 1500 in Saint Petersburg According to the United States Department of Energy socialist economies also maintained a much higher level of energy intensity than either the Western nations or the Third World This analysis is confirmed by the Institute of Economic Affairs with Mikhail Bernstam stating that economies of the Eastern Bloc had an energy intensity between twice and three times higher as economies of the West Some see the aforementioned examples of environmental degradation are similar to what had occurred in Western capitalist countries during the height of their drive to industrialize in the 19th century Others claim that Communist regimes did more damage than average primarily due to the lack of any popular or political pressure to research environmentally friendly technologies

Some ecological problems continue unabated after the fall of the Soviet Union and are still major issues today which has prompted supporters of former ruling Communist parties to accuse their opponents of holding a double standard However other environmental problems have improved in every studied former Communist state Some researchers have argued that part of improvement was largely due to the severe economic downturns in the 1990s that caused many factories to close down

Communist countries states areas and local communities have been based on the rule of parties proclaiming a basis in MarxismLeninism an ideology which is not supported by all Marxists and leftists Many communists disagree with many of the actions undertaken by ruling Communist parties during the 20th century

Elements of the left opposed to Bolshevik plans before they were put into practice included the revisionist Marxists such as Eduard Bernstein who denied the necessity of a revolution Anarchists who had differed from Marx and his followers since the split in the First International many of the Socialist Revolutionaries and the Marxist Mensheviks supported the overthrow of the tsar but vigorously opposed the seizure of power by Lenin and the Bolsheviks

Criticisms of Communist rule from the left continued after the creation of the Soviet state The anarchist Nestor Makhno led the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War and the Socialist Revolutionary Fanya Kaplan tried to assassinate Lenin Bertrand Russell visited Russia in 1920 and regarded the Bolsheviks as intelligent but clueless and planless In her books about Soviet Russia after the revolution My Disillusionment in Russia and My Further Disillusionment in Russia Emma Goldman condemned the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion as a massacre Eventually the Left Socialist Revolutionaries broke with the Bolsheviks

Antirevisionists which includes radical MarxistLeninist factions Hoxhaists and Maoists criticize the rule of the communist states by claiming that they were state capitalist states ruled by revisionists Though the periods and countries defined as state capitalist or revisionist varies among different ideologies and parties all of them accept that the Soviet Union was socialist during Stalins time Maoists believe that the Peoples Republic of China became state capitalist after Maos death Hoxhaists believe that the Peoples Republic of China was always state capitalist and uphold Socialist Albania as the only socialist state after the Soviet Union under Stalin

Left communists claim that the communist or socialist states or peoples states were actually state capitalist and thus cannot be called socialist Some of the earliest critics of Leninism were the GermanDutch left communists including Herman Gorter Anton Pannekoek and Paul Mattick Though most left communists see the October Revolution positively their analysis concludes that by the time of the Kronstadt revolt the revolution had degenerated due to various historical factors Rosa Luxemburg was another communist who disagreed with Lenins organizational methods which eventually led to the creation of the Soviet Union

Amadeo Bordiga wrote about his view of the Soviet Union as a capitalist society In contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists Bordigas writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy also focused on the agrarian sector Being the engineer that he was Bordiga displayed a kind of theoretical rigidity which was both exasperating and effective in allowing him to see things differently He wanted to show how capitalist social relations existed in the kolkhoz and in the sovkhoz one a cooperative farm and the other the straight wagelabor state farm He emphasized how much of agrarian production depended on the small privately owned plots he was writing in 1950 and predicted quite accurately the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia had been such a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914 In Bordigas conception Stalin and later Mao Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara were great romantic revolutionaries in the 19th century sense ie bourgeois revolutionaries He felt that the Stalinist regimes that came into existence after 1945 were just extending the bourgeois revolution ie the expropriation of the Prussian Junker class by the Red Army through their agrarian policies and through the development of the productive forces

After the split between Leon Trotsky and Stalin Trotskyists have argued that Stalin transformed the Soviet Union into a bureaucratic and repressive oneparty state and that all subsequent Communist states ultimately followed a similar path because they copied Stalinism There are various terms used by Trotskyists to define such states such as degenerated workers state and deformed workers state state capitalist or bureaucratic collectivist While Trotskyists are Leninists there are other Marxists who reject Leninism entirely arguing for example that the Leninist principle of democratic centralism was the source of the Soviet Unions slide away from communism Maoists view the Soviet Union and most of its satellites as state capitalist as a result of destalinization and some of them also view modern China in this light

Groshong line
A Groshong line is a type of both tunneled or nontunneled intravenous catheter used for central venous access

Groshongs may be left in place for extended periods and are used when longterm intravenous therapy is needed such as for chemotherapy Similar to the Hickman line the tip of the catheter is in the superior vena cava and the catheter is tunneled under the skin to an incision on the chest wall where the distal end of the catheter exits the body

In contrast to the Hickman line the tip of a Groshong line has a threeway valve which is formed by a slit in the sidewall of the catheter tip The valve opens outward during infusion and opens inward during blood aspiration When not being accessed the valve remains closed

The insertion of a central Groshong line is usually done under local anesthetic by a interventional anaesthesiologist interventional radiologist or surgeon Throughout the procedure ultrasound and Xrays may be used to confirm placement When a central venous catheter is inserted a chest radiologic examination is usually performed to confirm the position of the catheter and absence of pneumothorax The chest radiologic examination is integral to the procedure

Groshong catheters come in PICC line variations as well 
The Groshong catheter is a trademark of Bard Access Systems

The Groshong Catheter  Line is named after its inventor LeRoy E Groshong MD a surgical oncologist based in Oregon

Joseph B Ely
Joseph Buell Ely February 22 1881  June 13 1956 was an American lawyer and Democratic politician from Massachusetts As a conservative Democrat Ely was active in party politics from the late 1910s helping to build in conjunction with David I Walsh the Democratic coalition that would gain an enduring political ascendancy in the state From 1931 to 1935 he served as the 52nd Governor He was opposed to the federal expansion of the New Deal and was a prominent intraparty voice in opposition to the policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt In 1944 he made a brief unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination

Joseph Buell Ely was born in Westfield Massachusetts to Henry Wilson Ely and Sarah Naomi Buell Ely His grandfather Joseph Miner Ely was one of the founders of Westfields important whip industry and his father a lawyer was active in Democratic party circles in heavily Republican western Massachusetts Ely attended local schools and then Williams College where he helped organize student support for William Jennings Bryan in the 1900 presidential election He graduated from Williams in 1902 and then received a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1905 He returned to Westfield where he joined his fathers law firm In 1906 he married Harriet Zelda Dyson a schoolteacher they had one son

Governor David I Walsh appointed Ely to serve as District Attorney for the Western District of Massachusetts in 1915 he was elected in his own right to this position the next year serving until 1920

Ely was active in the state Democratic Party and was in 1922 put forward as a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts he placed a distant third in the primary which was won by John Honey Fitz Fitzgerald In 1924 he was delegate to the national Democratic convention where he supported the Progressive Al Smith In 1926 he was tapped by the party leadership as a candidate for Lieutenant Governor but lost the primary in an unusual quirk His primary opponent Harry Dooley had been asked to withdraw so that the party could present an ethnically diverse and geographically balanced ticket but his name remained on the ballot and he ended up winning the nomination because of the support of Irish Americans Dooley offered to surrender the nomination in favor of Ely but the latter refused believing the means to be an embarrassment Ely again supported Smith at the 1928 Democratic National Convention

In 1930 Ely again stood for the Democratic nomination for governor He was opposed in this by the aging Honey Fitz who was little more than a proxy candidate for former Boston mayor James Michael Curley Curley loudly accused the Yankee Protestant Ely of being antiIrish which Ely countered by pointing out Curleys own public criticisms of IrishAmerican politicians in his campaigns Al Smith campaigned for Ely who won the nomination by a narrow margin

Ely was opposed in the general election by incumbent Governor Frank G Allen The Republicans were harmed politically by the 1929 Stock Market Crash and the start of the Great Depression and were further divided over the issue of Prohibition Ely ran on a platform emphasizing debtfinanced public works projects

After Ely took office he began a series of public works projects to relieve unemployment These were funded by longterm debts and were approved by the Republicancontrolled legislature Unlike other states Massachusetts refused federal aid during Elys administration Highway construction in Massachusetts was accelerated by this work which was also supported by the imposition of a gasoline tax

Other policies advocated by Ely included substantial reductions in state salaries during the depression which was met with overwhelming legislative resistance In concert with the City of Boston Ely established a permanent Boston Police Academy to increase the training of public safety officers

Curley and Ely would again cross swords in the 1932 presidential election when Curley supported Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Ely supported Smith Ely and Walsh were successful in getting Curley and other Roosevelt supporters excluded from the states delegation to the 1932 Democratic National Convention although Curley attended the convention anyway as a delegate representing Puerto Rico Ely shifted his support to Roosevelt after the latter won the partys nomination but was snubbed by Roosevelt on federal appointment matters because of his support for Smith Ely comfortably won reelection in 1932 defeating Lieutenant Governor William S Youngman Since the debtfunded works projects were not having a significant impact economically Ely abandoned the idea in his second term returning to payasyougo financing for such projects

Ely declined to run for reelection in 1934 and returned to his law practice He remained active in state and national Democratic politics continuing to oppose Roosevelts New Deal policies In 1935 he joined the American Liberty League and supported Republican Alf Landon in the 1936 presidential election He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1944 ending the bid after being badly defeated in the Massachusetts primary

Joseph Ely is well remembered in his hometown where Westfield State Universitys Governor Joseph B Ely Library is named in his honor

<doc id="7720572" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7720572" title="Armed Forces Flag Day">
Armed Forces Flag Day
The Armed Forces Flag Day or the Flag Day of India is a day dedicated to India towards collection of funds from people of India for the welfare of the Indian Armed Forces personnel It has been observed annually in India on December 7 since 1949 Over the years it has become a tradition to commemorate this day as an honour to the soldiers sailors and airmen of India

Immediately after India achieved independence a need arose for the government to manage the welfare of its defence personnel On August 28 1949 a committee set up under the defence minister decided to observe a Flag Day annually on December 7 The idea behind observing a Flag Day was to distribute small flags to the general population and in return collect donations Flag Day gains more significance as it considers that it is the responsibility of the civilian population of India to take care of the families and dependents of the armed forces personnel who fight for the country

Jawaharlal Nehru who was then Prime Minister of India on December 7 1954 said

The Flag day is mainly observed to serve three basic purposes

The Armed Forces Flag Day commemoration and the collection of funds through distribution of flags It is a time for Indians to express its gratitude and appreciation to the current and veteran military personnel of India and to acknowledge those who died in service to the country

On the Flag Day all three branches of the Indian armed forces the Indian Army the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy arrange a variety of shows carnivals dramas and other entertainment programmes to showcase to the general public the efforts of their personnel to ensure national security Throughout the country small flags and car flags in red deep blue and light blue colours representing the three Services are distributed in return for donations

The original Flag Day Fund was set up in 1949 by the Defence Ministers Committee In 1993 the Defence Ministry of India consolidated related welfare funds into a single Armed Forces Flag Day fund Those funds include

The fund collection is managed throughout the country by the local arms of the Kendriya Sainik Board KSB which is part of the Ministry of Defence The collection is organised both by official and nonofficial means through voluntary organisations Though welfare of the exservicemen and their dependents is the joint responsibility of the union government and the governments of States and Union Territories UTs majority of the problems have to be resolved only by the States and UTs Like the Kendriya Sainik Board at the Centre the Rajya  Zila Sainik Boards are responsible for policy formulation and implementation of resettlement and welfare schemes for exservicemen widows and their dependents residing in their respective States  UTs  Districts To assist the Central Government in this regard there are 32 Rajya Sainik Boards and 392 Zila Sainik Boards in the country

The Secretary KSB advises the Department of Sainik Welfare in the States  UTs on the policies for resettlement and welfare of exservicemen widows and seeks reports from the Director Department Sainik Welfare  Secretary RSB and Zila Sainik Welfare Officer  Secretary ZSB on implementation of policies and success in resettling exservicemen widows disabled personnel invalidated out from the Service and their dependents Advice is also rendered on the welfare schemes required for the clientele which are financed from funds allotted by the Governments of States  UTs and the Amalgamated Special FundsThe Fund is operated by a Managing Committee presided over by the Defence Minister at the Centre and by the executive heads of the governments in the States and Union Territories When the Armed Forces Flag Day programme was introduced the fund allocation was managed in such a way that the Central KSB headquarters is given only a very small share of the Flag Day Fund collections made by each state The allotted funds for the KSB is only half a paisa per individual in the state

Alvan T Fuller
Alvan Tufts Fuller February 27 1878  April 30 1958 was an American businessman politician art collector and philanthropist from Massachusetts He opened one of the first automobile dealerships in Massachusetts which in 1920 was recognized as the worlds most successful auto dealership and made him one of the states wealthiest men Politically a Progressive Republican he was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1916 and served as a United States Representative from 1917 to 1921

From 1925 to 1929 Fuller was Governor of Massachusetts continuing the fiscally conservative and socially moderate policies of his predecessors In 1927 he was enveloped in the international controversy surrounding the trial and execution of Sacco and Vanzetti Italian immigrant anarchists convicted of robbery and murder Fullers handling of the affair in which pressure was applied by both domestic and international sources seeking clemency for the two effectively ended his political career

Fuller was an avid collector of art some of which has since been donated to museums in eastern New England including the Museum of Fine Arts Boston He founded the Fuller Foundation a charity that supports a variety of causes in eastern Massachusetts and the seacoast region of New Hampshire Fuller Gardens founded by him in North Hampton New Hampshire are now open to the public

Alvan Tufts Fuller was born in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston on February 27 1878 to working class parents Alvan and Flora Tufts Fuller His family moved to Malden Massachusetts when he was still a child He first worked in a rubber factory repairing bicycles on the side To promote his bicycle business he raced winning local events He also engaged in a practice shared by other bicycle shops in the area of holding an open house on the Washingtons Birthday holiday

Enamored by the new automobile Fuller sold his racing trophies to finance a trip to Europe in 1899 where he learned more about the automobile industry He acquired two cars French De DionBouton voiturettes and had them shipped to Boston they were the first motor vehicles brought in through that port In 1903 he was awarded the Boston franchise for selling Packards and later also acquired the local Cadillac franchise
Fuller was enormously successful in the automobile business extending his sales reach as far west as Worcester and south to Providence Rhode Island He opened his first dealership on Commonwealth Avenue in the Allston neighborhood of Boston then a largely undeveloped area known by sheer coincidence as Packards corner after the owner of a nearby livery yard He was however soon followed by other auto dealers creating the Boston areas first auto row Fuller was a significant factor in the success of Packard sales on the east coast and was in 1920 dubbed the worlds most successful car dealer In 1927 he began construction on a new building at 808 Commonwealth Avenue Designed by the noted industrial architect Albert Kahn it became the flagship showroom for his Cadillac dealership It is now owned by Boston University and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places

As a car dealer Fuller continued the practice of holding Washingtons Birthday open houses but the scale of events he staged was significantly more elaborate and he is generally credited with popularizing the idea of the Presidents Day car sale that is now common in the United States

Fuller became interested in politics around 1912 supporting Theodore Roosevelt in his Bull Moose candidacy for the presidency He refused the Progressive Party nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1912 but won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1914 under its banner Joining the Republican Party in 1916 he served as a delegate to its convention in 1916 The same year he ran for the United States House of Representatives as an independent winning a 16vote victory over longtime incumbent Republican Ernest W Roberts He served two terms in the Sixtyfifth and Sixtysixth Congresses from March 4 1917 to January 5 1921 winning election to the second term by a wider margin as a Republican

Fuller was an outspoken proponent of reform within Congress and as a matter of principle never cashed paychecks he received for his public service or used the Congressional franking privilege He criticized the inefficient means by which legislation made its way through Congress calling it the most expensive barnacle that ever attached itself to the ship of state Criticisms such as these prompted President Woodrow Wilson to introduce a new and more centralized budgeting system in 1919 Reforms Fuller proposed included a number of steps designed to increase transparency and reduce opportunities for political influence within the operations of Congress
In 1920 Fuller ran for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts and won two terms serving as the 48th lieutenant governor from 1921 to 1925 alongside Governor Channing Cox His principal opposition in both elections was in the Republican primary where he was pitted against the Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Joseph E Warner The Democrats were then relatively disorganized and lacking effective leadership and were unable to counter the basic Republican message of economy and sound administration that had characterized recent elections

Fuller was elected 50th Governor in 1924 after Cox decided not run for reelection The 1924 election was against the colorful Mayor of Boston James Michael Curley Fullers campaign rhetoric focused on the excesses of what it called Curleyism which it likened to a graftridden spending spree Curley attempted to tie Fuller to the Ku Klux Klan but his charges were exposed as meritlessFullers wife was Roman Catholic a group the Klan disliked and Fuller was known to have contributed to Catholic charities Fuller was reelected by a substantial majority in 1926 over William A Gaston in a campaign dominated by Democratic calls for reform of Prohibition As he had while in Congress Fuller refused compensation for his services

Fuller was viewed as a law and order prodeath penalty governor and a fiscal conservative He was like his predecessors a social moderate enacting modest reforms in areas such as automobile insurance
Fullers tenure as governor coincided with the Sacco and Vanzetti case a series of trials for murder and robbery followed by legal appeals that culminated in domestic and international calls for the governor to either grant a new trial or to commute the death sentences of the two Italian immigrants active in anarchist political circles He appointed a threemember panel consisting of Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell MIT President Dr Samuel W Stratton and retired Probate Judge Robert Grant to conduct a complete review of the case and determine if the trials were fair The committee reported that no new trial was called for and based on that assessment Governor Fuller refused to delay their executions or grant clemency On May 10 1927 while Fuller was considering requests for clemency a package bomb addressed to him was intercepted in the Boston post office A few months after the executions he endorsed proposals to reform the states judicial procedures to require a more thorough review of capital cases The episode led to Fuller being characterized in the international press as provincial and the controversy surrounding the cases and criticism of his handling of it which was widely seen to exacerbate rather than diminish political tensions effectively ended his hopes for higher office New York Times reporter Louis Stark repeated a widely held belief that Fullers decision to deny clemency was motivated by a desire to succeed Calvin Coolidge in the presidency but there is no substantive evidence to corroborate this idea beyond the coincident timing of Coolidges announced decision not run in 1928 and Fullers decision In 1930 Fuller stated in an interview that he was more concerned about the political activities of the two men and their supporters which he saw as a threat to order and security of the United States When Fuller was offered a print edition of The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1929 at the inauguration of his successor he deliberately threw it to the ground

In 1928 Fuller was an early supporter of Herbert Hoovers presidential campaign after considering his own run for the presidency and was briefly considered as a candidate for Vice President He was dropped from consideration because as Republican Senator William Borah put it The Republican Party cannot afford to spend the summer debating the SaccoVanzetti case His handling of the case was seen to reduce support for the ticket among immigrant communities He was dropped from consideration by the Hoover administration for consideration as United States Ambassador to France after the French government indicated it could not guarantee his safety due to the SaccoVanzetti affair When the controversy was at its height in 1927 the Fullers had traveled to France and the French government had secretly provided heightened security around their movements Fuller considered running for Senate in 1930 and Governor in 1934 but dropped out of the primaries in those races In 1933 he was appointed by the Public Works Administration PWA to a board overseeing the distribution of PWA funds in Massachusetts He was again considered as a Vice Presidential nominee in 1932 but ran well back in the convention balloting

After leaving office Fuller returned to his automotive business serving as chairman of the board of CadillacOldsmobile Co of Boston In 1949 he dropped the Packard dealership and focused exclusively on the Cadillac and Oldsmobile brands

Fuller was a philanthropist and art collector serving as a trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston MFA Painters represented in his collection included Renoir Rembrandt Turner Gainsborough Sargent Monet Van Dyck Romney Boccaccino Boucher and Reynolds Paintings that he and his successors donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the MFA include Monets The Water Lily Pond Renoirs Boating Couple and van Dycks Princess Mary Daughter of Charles I His philanthropy was wideranging and included art hospitals education religion municipalities and social services He established The Fuller Foundation Inc during his lifetime still in operation it supports many charitable agencies in the Greater Boston area and the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire

Fuller died in Boston on April 30 1958 He was interred in East Cemetery also known as the Little River Cemetery in North Hampton New Hampshire where he had a summer home The summer property included a large garden that the Fullers developed with landscape design guidance by Arthur Shurtleff and the Olmsted Brothers It is now open to the public seasonally

Fuller married Viola Theresa Davenport of Somerville in Paris in 1910 with whom he had four children two boys and two girls She had a brief career as an opera singer performing in Paris and then debuting in Boston in 1910 She died in 1959

Peter Fuller his youngest son was an avid supporter of civil rights and continued the family auto business He was the owner of Dancers Image the horse that won the Kentucky Derby in 1968 Fuller was stripped of his winning title because a banned drug was found in the horses urine He and his supporters claimed he had been singled out because he had recently donated a winners purse of 77415 from a different race to Coretta Scott King the widow of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr who had been assassinated a month earlier and who the year before had disrupted derby events by demonstrating against housing discrimination in nearby Louisville He lost a fouryear legal battle to retain the Kentucky Derby title and prize money

Fullers automobile dealership established with license 1 continues to be operated within the family Now dealing in rentals and used vehicles it has locations in Watertown and Waltham Massachusetts

<doc id="7720600" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7720600" title="AngloSaxon military organization">
AngloSaxon military organization
AngloSaxon military organization is difficult to analyze because there are many conflicting records and opinions as to the precise occurrences and procedures AngloSaxon England was known for its tumultuous nature and the constant presence of outside threats and dangers made it necessary for a solid military to be constantly in place However in spite of this by the 10th century the Saxon kingdom of England was perhaps the best ordered state in Europe with a highly efficient administration that had a solid currency and could raise taxes to support a military establishment Even though there is some controversy as to the accurate forms of military organization some aspects can be deduced from the records that have been preserved

The period can however be split into two before settlement AD 400 to AD 600 and the settlement period when the Saxons had established organized kingdoms AD 600 to AD 1066

The Saxons were organized into warbands led by a chief The warriors comprising the warband were professional soldiers though perhaps without the discipline of the Romans There were three classes of warrior

The Gedriht were the personal followers of the chief and were sworn to die with him There would have been few of them in each warband They would have been well armed and the majority would have worn a helmet and chainmail armour The main weapon was the Gar a 25m long spear with an ash shaft Old English gar  spear Many would have carried long slashing swords

The second group were the Geoguth or young warriors They would have formed the bulk of the warband and would have carried a shield spear and Seax a single edged dagger or short sword Few would have had helmets or defensive armour
The Duguth or old warriors appear later in this period They would have carried the same equipment as the geoguth and served mainly to provide a stabilising element in battle

In addition there would have been skirmishers armed with either a bow or sling

This appears to have changed during this period At the beginning the shield was small more like a buckler and suggests that the men fought in open order Later the shield was enlarged up to 1m across and the warband fought in close order which required a reasonable level of training and discipline This style of fighting had a long history it was known as a shield wall or phalanx formation

The use of the horse in battle is very unclear and probably only the gedriht would have had them However horses at this period were small and would have had to be battle trained On balance the sources indicate that the Saxons fielded a balanced and effective infantry army It seems likely that horses would have been used either for scouting or transport

It is not clear how large armies were the Saxons themselves described anything more than 30 warriors as an army This was about same number as a ships crew The general view is that an army would have been made up of a number of warbands under a senior chief or Althing and would have been between 200 and 600 strong

The organisation underwent considerable changes becoming essentially more feudal The Gedriht became a more organised household guard  which provided a core of military specialists the huscarls Individual Earls would have had their own household troops There is also a new class of lord the Thegn which was roughly the equivalent of the later Norman Baron Thegns held land from the king and were responsible for raising the Fyrd in their area and leading them into battle The richer Thegns would also have had their own household troops

However the major innovation is in the organization of the Fyrd This in the post Alfred period is called up in groups either to man the Burhs each burh had a manpower level calculated according to the length of wall or to serve in the field army By this process a Saxon army could remain in the field all year as there are always enough men at home producing food and goods The army was thus significantly larger than in the early period In addition by the 11th century the increasing wealth of England its increased centralisation and its growing class of freemen meant that helmets weapons and armour could be made in far greater numbers This meant that by the 10th century laws appear to have required a freeman who had the financial means to own a spear a shield an axe or sword and a helmet The laws of the day required Fyrd members to be men of a particular class freemen who could afford decent equipment and training

Weapons and equipment remained broadly the same although the majority of a warband now had a helmet The Dane Axe which required a great deal of training to use effectively became increasingly popular with the huscarls

AngloSaxon battle tactics have also spawned much debate Some historians believe that horses were used though most argue that the battles took place on foot Infantry battles are reported in many texts from the period AngloSaxon military organization is difficult to analyze

The combat strength of the AngloSaxon army is another issue that cannot be agreed upon by scholars Some historians argue that the army was weak and only used infantry as a means of defense and attack while cavalry were only used for scouting whereas others believe that the army was more powerful employing infantry and cavalry The former argument suggests that the infantry was of a high standard but did not have the capacity to press home an advantage due to the lack of cavalry It was also suggested by historians until the 1980s that the AngloSaxons did not carry high quality weapons

Since the 1970s however archaeologists and historians have created a more varied view of AngloSaxon armies The early Saxon armies are now thought to have been very formidable indeed specializing in highintensity close combat The large shield was an offensive weapon as well as defensive In the later period the Saxons adopted the Danish battle axe which had a 13m shaft and could decapitate a horse or break up an opposing shield wall

There was no cavalry in western Europe capable of consistently breaking a wellordered shieldwall aside perhaps from the Byzantine Cataphracts This was due to the relatively small size of horses and the fact that even with the advent of the couched lance in the 12th century well disciplined spearmen still presented a major problem for cavalry This was demonstrated at Hastings when the Normans who probably were the best cavalry of the period tried all day to break the AngloSaxon line

To judge the effectiveness of any military formation one first needs to determine what was its function The early Saxon armies were aggressive small raiding units that could be quickly combined in a larger unit to take land and goods The later armys function was defensive and was the military expression of an organised state It not only depended on raising manpower through the fyrd but on a network of burghs that provided supply bases and mustering points It was this system that allowed Alfred and his successors to conquer England and for Harold to move his army rapidly against the Danes and defeat them at Stamford Bridge then move elements 250 miles south to Hastings

There are some battles in which scholars generally agree on which tactics and methods were used The Battle of Hastings in 1066 the soldiers were organized with the best in the front line and the less adequate fighters in the following lines They formed a tightly packed shield wall with spears projecting from the front rank over the shieldwall Protecting the areas behind and to the side were a small number of archers javelin throwers and slingers The Bayeux Tapestry also shows armoured Saxon warriors using the long handled Danish axe Either they stood in front of the shield wall or the wall opened to let them through Though this formation has been criticised it was highly effective it provided reasonable cover from missile weapons and was capable of fending off most cavalry It also needs to be remembered that all the Saxons needed to do in order to achieve victory was to hold their position until sunset and the Normans would be forced to break off the days fighting The Normans deprived of supplies and reinforcements be penned into a small area and with no way of feeding themselves or their horses would have been forced to retreat

It was in fact rather effective at repelling the Norman Cavalry and it was only the death of Harold and his brothers probably towards the end of the battle that caused the Saxon command system to ultimately fail and the battle to be lost This strategy was also used in the battle of Sherston in 1016 only with a slight difference  instead of simply holding position the army advanced on the enemy while maintaining their solid formation A refinement of this tactic was used in the crusades as the army neared the enemy line gaps would open in the shieldwall through which the cavalry would charge Military tactics did develop gradually throughout the AngloSaxon period Though there is still much debate as to how efficient the soldiers and the fighting was it is clear that as the ages progressed so too did the power and capability of the army

Samuel W McCall
Samuel Walker McCall February 28 1851  November 4 1923 was a Republican lawyer politician and writer from Massachusetts He was for twenty years 18931913 a member of the United States House of Representatives and the 47th Governor of Massachusetts serving three oneyear terms 191619 He was a moderately progressive Republican who sought to counteract the influence of money in politics

Born in Pennsylvania and educated at Dartmouth he settled in Massachusetts where he entered local politics on a progressive reform agenda Elected to Congress he continued his reform activities and opposed annexation of The Philippines He did not join the Progressive Party but was insufficiently conservative for state party leaders who denied him election to the United States Senate on two occasions As governor he directed the states actions during World War I and orchestrated early aid to Halifax Nova Scotia following a devastating munitions ship explosion there in 1917

Samuel Walker McCall was born in East Providence Township Pennsylvania on February 28 1851 to Henry and Mary Ann Elliott McCall the sixth of eleven children At a young age the family moved to an undeveloped frontier area of northern Illinois where McCall spent much of his childhood McCalls father speculated in real estate and owned a stove factory which was closed by financial reverses of the Panic of 1857 His education began at the Mount Carroll Seminary now Shimer College in Mount Carroll from 1864 to 1866 when that school closed to male students

McCalls parents then sent him east to the New Hampton Academy in New Hampton New Hampshire on the recommendation of a neighbor McCall graduated from New Hampton Academy in 1870 and subsequently attended Dartmouth College where he was a member of the Kappa Kappa Kappa fraternity and graduated Phi Beta Kappa near the top of his class While at Dartmouth he published a newspaper selffinanced by himself and the other editors called the Anvil and was tapped by the Dartmouth president to stand in for a sick teacher of Latin and Greek at an academy in Meriden New Hampshire The Anvil was one of the first studentrun newspapers to comment on national and state politics

After graduating McCall moved to Worcester Massachusetts where he studied law and gained admission to the Massachusetts Bar He then opened a law practice in Boston with a Dartmouth classmate which he maintained for most of his life In 1888 he and two partners purchased the Boston Daily Advertiser for which he served as editorinchief for two years In 1881 he married Ella Esther Thompson whom he met while attending New Hampton Academy they settled in Winchester Massachusetts where they raised five children

McCall was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1887 serving three terms in 1888 1889 and 1892 Politically a reformminded Mugwump he had supported Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884 he introduced legislation to govern socalled corrupt practices of elected officials intended to reduce the influence of money and favors in politics The legislation failed to pass the legislature until 1892 He also supported legislation abolishing imprisonment for debt He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1888 and served as the states ballot commissioner in 1890 and 1891

In 1892 McCall was elected to the United States House of Representatives a seat he would occupy for twenty years generally winning reelection by large margins As he had in the state legislature he introduced a corrupt practices act into Congress In foreign policy he was antiimperialist arguing for the independence of The Philippines after the SpanishAmerican War and opposed the Dingley Tariff arguing its rates were too high He was one of the few representatives opposed to the Hepburn Act which enabled the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroad rates He had a reputation as a bit of a maverick because he often strayed from the Republican party line but he maintained a generally conservative voting record and introduced little new legislation

In 1912 McCall refused to stand for reelection and was instead considered by the state legislature for election to the United States Senate in early 1913 to succeed the outgoing Senator Winthrop Murray Crane His opponent John W Weeks was more conservative Republican who had the support of most of the Cranedominated state party apparatus The contest was bitterly divisive an echo of the Progressive Party split that damaged the party at the national level and was narrowly won by Weeks even though McCall led in the party caucus balloting for the first three ballots

McCall was chosen by the party in 1914 as its nominee for Governor of Massachusetts as a unifying force between the more progressive and conservative wings of the party Running against the popular Democratic incumbent David I Walsh on a progressive platform McCall was narrowly defeated with the Republican votes split due to the presence of a Progressive Party candidate on the ballot McCall was nominated again in 1915 with the Republicans deliberately courting the Progressive vote by calling for a state constitutional convention In a rematch with Walsh he was this time victorious He served three consecutive terms with future President Calvin Coolidge as his lieutenant governor In each election Coolidge won more votes than McCall did and the Boston Transcript credited at least one of his victories to Coolidges drawing power

The Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 19171918 was the major political event of McCalls tenure The convention proposed a number of reforms most of which were adopted by the voters State commissions and agencies were streamlined and initiative and referendum measures were added to the state constitution Elections for statewide offices were changed from annual to biennial beginning in 1920 Legislative reforms proposed by McCall to the state legislature were only partially adopted proposals reforming state insurance and the public pension program were left in the legislature and his proposal to abolish capital punishment also failed

Anticipating American entry into World War I in early 1917 McCall formed the Massachusetts Public Safety Commission an emergency response and relief organization that was the first of its type in the nation Coordinating a wide array of public and charitable organizations and major businesses the commission played a significant role in providing relief and other services until it was disbanded in 1918 One of its most important actions was coordinating the states response to the Halifax Explosion of December 6 1917 With only fragmentary reports received early after a blast devastated the Nova Scotia city of Halifax McCall called the committee into action and offered unlimited assistance to the stricken city The state organized a major relief train even before the full extent of the disaster was known that was among the first to reach Halifax and the committees representatives assisted in organizing relief activities on the ground Temporary housing built in Halifax was named in McCalls honor and the states relief efforts continue to be recognized today by Nova Scotias annual gift of a Christmas tree to the city of Boston

In 1918 McCall decided not to run for reelection and again stood for the United States Senate In a party nomination rematch with Weeks he abandoned the campaign after it became clear the conservative Crane wing of the party was standing with Weeks The seat ended up being won by exGovernor Walsh in a Democratic upset In the general election McCall refused to campaign on Weeks behalf a move that contributed to the end of his political career In 1920 he was nominated by President Woodrow Wilson for a seat on the United States Tariff Commission the nomination was rejected by the Republicancontrolled Senate

McCall was engaged in literary pursuits for many years writing in newspapers and magazines of the day Following his exit from politics he focused on these activities writing for the Atlantic Monthly magazine and working on political biographies His writings include biographies of his mentor Thomas Brackett Reed Pennsylvania politician Thaddeus Stevens and he was working in a biography of Daniel Webster when he died

McCall died in Winchester on November 4 1923 His interment was in Wildwood Cemetery His grandson Tom McCall was a twoterm Republican Governor of Oregon serving from 1967 to 1975

Hurricane Bonnie 1992
Hurricane Bonnie was a longlived storm in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season It was the third tropical storm including the April subtropical storm and second hurricane of the 1992 season Bonnie formed at high latitudes in the central Atlantic on September 17 Devoid of any real steering currents for much of its lifespan it was nearly stationary for over a week in the central Atlantic Ocean On September 27 it began to slowly track east and northeast towards the Azores Just before becoming extratropical it affected the Azores on September 30 although no damage was reported

The origins of the system was a cold front that moved off the US East Coast on September 11 The front moved gradually off the coast and into the subtropical Atlantic Ocean before becoming stationary just east of Bermuda on September 15 Over the next two days the cloud cover slowly detached itself from the front and form into a tropical low in its own right On the afternoon of September 17 the system was organized enough to be declared Tropical Depression Four

The depression organized steadily that evening and into the morning of September18 Later that day it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie and it began to move slowly to the northeast Like most storms that develop in higher latitudes Bonnie was embedded in a largerscale cyclonic circulation at first which minimized shear allowing it to develop and provided weak steering currents The low shear allowed Bonnie to rapidly develop and a small but welldefined eye formed late that morning The storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day while meandering in the open ocean The intensification rate slowed down after becoming a hurricane In addition Bonnie began to slowly move more to the northeast on September19 as steering currents slowly developed Bonnie strengthened into a Category2 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson hurricane scale that morning as well peaking at 105mph 165kmh with a 970mbar central pressure The general track and intensity maintained itself throughout the day and into September20 when the eye became less distinct and Bonnie weakened slightly although remaining a Category2 hurricane Early on September21 the eye became better defined once again and Bonnie restrengthened slightly while continuing its slow northeast motion That afternoon the storm gradually strengthened some more and reached its peak intensity of 110mph 175kmh and a central pressure of 965mbar just under Category3 intensity Bonnie maintained its strength through the evening and into the early morning of September 22 when it began to weaken very gradually and level off Bonnie also began to turn more eastward at that point before it became held up by a blocking midlatitude ridge of high pressure which stalled the motion

Bonnie remained virtually stationary until the morning of September23 when it drifted very slowly to the westsouthwest in response to the ridge It also began to gradually weaken as the lowlevel center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized Convection also diminished and on the afternoon of September24 Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it began to make a turn back around to the south That evening Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression
The weakening trend ended early on September26 and Bonnie regained tropical storm status that afternoon as deep convection reestablished itself Bonnie continued its change in direction turning to the southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a highshear environment It had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on September27 as it made the turn to the northeast as a weak tropical storm and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until the afternoon of September28 During that period Bonnie actually strengthened back into a highend tropical storm Bonnie roughly followed Hurricane Charleys path towards the Azores thereafter The storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear although it only weakened slightly on September29 as it accelerated towards the northeast The storm crossed over the Azores on September30 as a strong tropical storm with 65mph 100kmh winds After that Bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon just east of the Azores The extratropical low drifted back to the southwest in a clockwise loop actually approaching the Azores once again while dissipating It dissipated on October2

When Bonnie passed over the Azores only four days after Charley it resulted in tropical stormforce winds across much of the island chain Lajes Air Base reported sustained winds of 40mph 64kmh with gusts to 59mph 94kmh In addition one man was killed by a rock fall on the island of So Miguel No damage was reported in the Azores

Roger L Easton
Roger Lee Easton Sr April 30 1921  May 8 2014 was an American scientistphysicist who was the principal inventor and designer of the Global Positioning System along with Ivan A Getting and Bradford Parkinson He was born in Craftsbury Vermont

In 1955 Easton cowrote the Naval Research Laboratorys Project Vanguard proposal for a US satellite program in competition with two other proposals including a proposal from the US Army prepared by Wernher Von Braun The Eisenhower Administration selected Project Vanguard In 1957 Easton invented the Minitrack tracking system to determine the Vanguard satellites orbit When Sputnik I was launched Easton extended the system to actively follow unknown orbiting satellites

In 1959 he designed the Naval Space Surveillance NAVSPASUR system The Naval Space Surveillance System became the first system to detect and track all types of Earthorbiting objects It goes through the 33rd parallel which is effectively coast to coast of the US

Later in his career at NRL Easton conceived patented and led the development of essential enabling technologies for the United States Global Positioning System GPS During the 1960s and early 1970s he developed a timebased navigational system with passive ranging circular orbits and spaceborne high precision clocks placed in satellites The idea was tested with four experimental satellites TIMATION I and II in 1967 and 1969 and Navigation Technology Satellites NTS 1 and 2 in 1974 and 1977 NTS2 was the first satellite to transmit GPS signals

Easton was born in Craftsbury Vermont to Dr Frank B Easton a physician and Della Donnocker a school teacher He graduated from Middlebury College in 1943 He also attended the University of Michigan for 1 semester before joining the Naval Research Laboratory in 1943 At the Naval Research Laboratory he worked in the Radio Division on radar beacons and blindlanding systems Easton also worked in the laboratorys RocketSonde Branch which was dealing with space related research

Easton retired in 1980 In 1986 Easton ran for Governor and served 3 terms on the Board of the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative

Easton died on May 8 2014 at the age of 93

George W Bush awarded Easton the National Medal of Technology for his extensive pioneering achievements in spacecraft tracking navigation and timing technology that led to the development of the NAVSTARGlobal Positioning System GPS in 2006 The National Medal of Technology is the highest honor awarded for technology
On March 31 2010 Easton was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and presented the NIHF Medal of Honor for the development of TIMed navigATION TIMATION  US Patent 3789409 that provided both accurate position and precise time to terrestrial based observers an important foundation for contemporary Global Positioning Systems

During his career at the Naval Research Laboratory Easton was awarded

Brachypelma klaasi
Brachypelma klaasi also known as the Mexican pink tarantula is a tarantula endemic to Mexico and it is the rarest of the genus Brachypelma

The setae of this species have a uniformly rusty appearance The coloration is very similar to that of the six species of Brachypelma that are endemic to the west coast B boehmei is similar having black tarsi orangeyellow metatarsi tibias and patellas black femora and coxae and orangeyellow hairs on the opistosoma It differs only in the carapace which is yelloworange in B boehmei and black in B klaasi Another very similar species is B baumgarteni Adults of B klaasi have a body length of about 675cm with a 16cm legspan

The species is named in honor of Peter Klaas the collector of the species

B klaasi is found at elevations of 3001400 m above sea level on the western slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental and some areas on the western limits of the Transverse Volcanic Belt in Jalisco and Nayarit states Its known range extends from Tepic Nayarit in the north to Chamela Jalisco in the south with the largest known population at the biological reserve at Chamela

There is a high rate of collection for the pet trade of B klaasi and other members of the genus Brachypelma As such all members of Brachypelma have been placed on Appendix II of CITES B klaasi is considered to be the rarest and most threatened of the Mexican tarantula species Their slow growth combined with habitat degradation and illegal wild capture for the pet trade means that it is estimated that less than 01 of individual tarantulas survive from egg to adulthood in the wild

WININI
WININI is a basic INI file that was used in versions of the Microsoft Windows operating environment up to Windows 311 to store basic settings at boot time By default all font communications drivers wallpaper screen saver and language settings were stored in WININI by Windows 3x Many of these settings were honored in Windows 9x although the files had begun to be phased out in favor of the Windows registry Windows XP still acknowledged some entries in the WININI file to provide backwards compatibility with older 16bit applications However when a fresh install of XP is performed the WININI file created is initially blank and in Windows Vista and Windows 7 the WININI file was removed entirely

Prior to Windows 30 it was not uncommon for applications to store their configuration settings inside WININI With the release of Windows 30 in 1990 Microsoft introduced the concept of private INI files and some new application programming interface calls so that applications could store their settings in their own files
Today Microsoft recommends using other methods for storing settings

Microsoft bundles two specialized editors for core configuration files such as WININI SYSTEMINI CONFIGSYS and AUTOEXECBAT with its operating systems Sysedit is an MDI text editor that opens all of those files simultaneously available in all versions of Windows since Windows 3x MSConfig included with Windows 98 and above except Windows 2000 is a simpler application that allows a user to enable and disable drivers and applications from being loaded at startup by the aforementioned files and the Run RunEx and RunOnce registry keys

 <doc id="7737010" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737010" title="Androgen replacement therapy">
  Androgen replacement therapy
  Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

  ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

  Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

  The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

  Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

  The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

  On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

  There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

  Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

  Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

  As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

  In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

  A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

  Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

  The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

  The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

  The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

  Pterodactyloidea
  Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

  Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

  In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

  Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

  A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

  There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
  Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

  Fernando Castro Pacheco
  Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

  Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

  Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

  While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

  In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

  Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

  Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

  After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

  Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

  After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

  The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

  To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

  Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

  To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

  Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

  As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

  One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

  Nathalia Crane
  Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

  After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

  Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

  She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

  Texas State Highway Loop 150
  Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

  The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

  In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

  Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

 <doc id="7737240" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737240" title="Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate">
  Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

  In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

  The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

  Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

  The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

  Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

  Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

  In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

  This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

  When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

  In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

  In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

  In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

  Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

  The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

  There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

  In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

  As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

  As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

  On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release

  Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

  IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

  In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

  Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses

  To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

  Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

  Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

  NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

  Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

  An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

  The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

  Pleasant Plains New Jersey
  Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

  Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

  An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

  Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

  Since the early 19th century and possibly even earlier the area featured a oneroom schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Lairds Corner it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its oneroom schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools Moved across the road on log rollers it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development Instead it was moved to the Townships Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation

  The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area

  According to the United States Census Bureau Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3221 square miles 8342km including 3215 square miles 8328km of land and 0006 square miles 0014km of water 017

  The Pleasant Plains Cemetery located on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner was established in 1898

  Peristimulus time histogram
  In neurophysiology peristimulus time histogram and poststimulus time histogram both abbreviated PSTH or PST histogram are histograms of the times at which neurons fire It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram and poststimulus and peristimulus are often hyphenated

  The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

  To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram


  The optimal bin size assuming an underlying Poisson point process  is a minimizer of the formula 2kv
  where k and v are mean and variance of k

  Oklahomas 2nd congressional district
  Oklahomas Second Congressional District is one of five United States Congressional districts in Oklahoma and covers approximately onefourth of the state in the east The district borders Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Texas and includes in whole or in part a total of 24 counties

  Historically the district has supported conservative Democrats and was reckoned as a classic Yellow Dog Democrat district However the growing Republican trend in the state has overtaken the district since the start of the 21st century In the last two elections the Republican presidential candidate has carried it by the largest margin in the state Urban voters represent a third of the district

  The district is represented by Republican Markwayne Mullin becoming only the second Republican after Tom Coburn to hold the seat since 1921

  The district borders Kansas to the north Missouri and Arkansas to the east and Texas along the Red River to the south It covers all or part of 26 counties It includes the remainder of Rogers County including the county seat of Claremore that is not included in the 1st District and then also all of the following counties Adair Nowata Craig Ottawa Mayes Delaware Cherokee Okmulgee Muskogee Sequoyah Okfuskee McIntosh Haskell LeFlore Hughes Pittsburg Latimer Coal Atoka Pushmataha McCurtain Choctaw Bryan Marshall and Johnston

  Some of the principal cities in the district include Miami Claremore Muskogee Tahlequah Okmulgee McAlester and Durant

  The northern half of the district includes most of the area of Oklahoma referred to as Green Country while the southern half of the district includes a part of Oklahoma often referred to as Little Dixie

  The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

  The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

  Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

  Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

 <doc id="7737468" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737468" title="Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop">
  Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
  The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

  The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

  With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

  Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

  Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990

  The residents began to call the area Castelo
  In 1936 the residents asked the state government to make the settlement a town named after Manoel Urbano an Amazonian mestizo from the Manacapur region who had explored the Purus River
  In the territorial division of 31 December 1936 the region was the Castelo district of the Sena Madureira municipality

 <doc id="7737010" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737010" title="Androgen replacement therapy">
  Androgen replacement therapy
  Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

  ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

  Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

  The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

  Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

  The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

  On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

  There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

  Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

  Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

  As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

  In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

  A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

  Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

  The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

  The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

  The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

  Pterodactyloidea
  Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

  Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

  In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

  Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

  A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

  There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
  Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

  Fernando Castro Pacheco
  Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

  Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

  Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

  While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

  In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

  Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

  Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

  After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

  Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

  After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

  The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

  To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

  Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

  To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

  Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

  As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

  One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

  Nathalia Crane
  Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

  After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

  Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

  She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

  Texas State Highway Loop 150
  Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

  The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

  In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

  Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

 <doc id="7737240" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737240" title="Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate">
  Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

  In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

  The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

  Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

  The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

  Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

  Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

  In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

  This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

  When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

  In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

  In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

  In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

  Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

  The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

  There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

  In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

  As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

  As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

  On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release

  Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

  IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

  In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

  Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses

  To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

  Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

  Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

  NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

  Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

  An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

  The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

  Pleasant Plains New Jersey
  Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

  Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

  An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

  Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

  Since the early 19th century and possibly even earlier the area featured a oneroom schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Lairds Corner it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its oneroom schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools Moved across the road on log rollers it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development Instead it was moved to the Townships Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation

  The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area

  According to the United States Census Bureau Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3221 square miles 8342km including 3215 square miles 8328km of land and 0006 square miles 0014km of water 017

  The Pleasant Plains Cemetery located on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner was established in 1898

  Peristimulus time histogram
  In neurophysiology peristimulus time histogram and poststimulus time histogram both abbreviated PSTH or PST histogram are histograms of the times at which neurons fire It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram and poststimulus and peristimulus are often hyphenated

  The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

  To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram

  Oklahomas 2nd congressional district
  Oklahomas Second Congressional District is one of five United States Congressional districts in Oklahoma and covers approximately onefourth of the state in the east The district borders Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Texas and includes in whole or in part a total of 24 counties

  Historically the district has supported conservative Democrats and was reckoned as a classic Yellow Dog Democrat district However the growing Republican trend in the state has overtaken the district since the start of the 21st century In the last two elections the Republican presidential candidate has carried it by the largest margin in the state Urban voters represent a third of the district

  The district is represented by Republican Markwayne Mullin becoming only the second Republican after Tom Coburn to hold the seat since 1921

  The district borders Kansas to the north Missouri and Arkansas to the east and Texas along the Red River to the south It covers all or part of 26 counties It includes the remainder of Rogers County including the county seat of Claremore that is not included in the 1st District and then also all of the following counties Adair Nowata Craig Ottawa Mayes Delaware Cherokee Okmulgee Muskogee Sequoyah Okfuskee McIntosh Haskell LeFlore Hughes Pittsburg Latimer Coal Atoka Pushmataha McCurtain Choctaw Bryan Marshall and Johnston

  Some of the principal cities in the district include Miami Claremore Muskogee Tahlequah Okmulgee McAlester and Durant

  The northern half of the district includes most of the area of Oklahoma referred to as Green Country while the southern half of the district includes a part of Oklahoma often referred to as Little Dixie

  According to the 2000 US Census the district is 3551 percent urban 2395 percent nonwhite and has a population that is 240 percent Latino and 136 percent foreignborn The district has a higher percentage of Native Americans than any other congressional district in Oklahoma Its representative Markwayne Mullin is one of two Native Americans currently serving in Congress

  The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

  The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

  Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

  Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

  Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
  The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

  The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

  With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

  Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

  Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990

  Androgen replacement therapy
  Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

  ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

  Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

  The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

  Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

  The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

  On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

  There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

  Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

  Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

  As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

  In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

  A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

  Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

  Marathon Rowing Championship
  The Marathon Rowing Championship is a continuous rowing regatta on the Cane River Lake in Natchitoches Louisiana Northwestern State University is the official host of the regatta The Marathon begins near the Melrose Plantation and ends at Front Street in Natchitoches The regatta is open to all sculling and sweepoar rowing boats On the day of the Marathon the Cane River is open only to competitors

  The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

  The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

  The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

  Pterodactyloidea
  Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

  Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

  In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

  Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

  A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

  There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
  Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

  Fernando Castro Pacheco
  Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

  Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

  Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

  While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

  In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

  Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

  Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

  After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

  Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

  After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

  The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

  To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

  Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

  To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

  Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

  As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

  One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children
