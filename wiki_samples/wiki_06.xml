The Gift Star Trek Voyager
The Gift is the second episode of the of the American science fiction television series  the 70th episode overall Set in the 24th century the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far from the rest of the Federation The episode marks the last appearance of Kes until the episode 

After  USS Voyager still remains without working warp propulsion and is infested with Borg technology Seven of Nine the Borg drone saved from the destruction of her cube has her connection with the Borg collective severed She is now able to function as an individual but she is shocked by the change and still refers to herself in the first person plural Her body nevertheless starts to heal and reject Borg technology The Doctor decides that he should remove her Borg implants so she can recover

The Doctor hesitates to operate on a patient who refuses medical attention but Captain Janeway who believes that Seven of Nine is unable to make decisions for herself in her current state convinces him to do it During the operation she starts to have a seizure caused by an implant in her brain Kes uses her increasingly powerful telepathic abilities to disable the implant and stop the seizure

The Doctor removes as much of the technology as possible save for those that are too much part of her vital systems but Seven of Nine is upset by the result She is not used to being an individual and she repeatedly demands that she be returned to the Collective Janeway refuses and asks her to help with removing the Borg technology in Voyagers systems

Meanwhile Kes and Tuvok meditate Kes has learned to manipulate matter on a subatomic level and begins to see beyond even that

As Seven of Nine begins her work on repairs she is closely guarded by Harry Kim and a security guard While looking at the hardware Seven sees a transmitter and her Borg impulses are sparked into action by the stimulus She pushes Ensign Kim out of the room shuts the door and barricades herself in the room She accesses a subspace transmitter and tries to send a message to the Borg Kes senses that something is wrong and uses her abilities to send an electrical surge that stops Seven

Seven is held in the brig where she has a long talk with Janeway about her separation from the Collective Meanwhile Neelix and Kes talk about their past She tells him about her new powers and demonstrates them Neelix is hurt as the table they were sitting at starts to change The ships structural integrity begins to destabilize When Janeway and Tuvok enter the room they see Kes on the floor and her body changing  destabilizing at the subatomic level as Tuvok explains The Doctor is unable to explain this reaction he only knows that her powers must be suppressed or she might die

Seven of Nine unsuccessfully tries to break through the brigs forcefield Janeway comes inside her cell with information about her past Before assimilation she was a human girl named Annika Hansen The new information enrages her and her wish to return to the Borg remains unchanged

Kes and Janeway have their last talk and Kes is overcome by her powers warping her very surroundings She cannot control herself and becomes a danger to the ship She and Janeway agree she should leave the ship before it is destroyed Kes boards a shuttle and puts some distance between herself and Voyager

As her atomic structure destabilizes she contacts Voyager and tells them she is about to give them a gift As she vanishes Voyagers warp core begins to function at more than 120 capacity The ship hurtles through space ending up over 9500 light years away in a flash The crew realizes they are safely beyond Borg space and ten years closer to home With their friend Kes far away and on another plane of existence the crew try to accept Seven into their midst Reluctantly she accepts their help and is seen later with most of her Borg implants removed now wearing a bodysuit to conceal the remaining implants and having her blonde hair grown back contemplating her new appearance in closed thoughts

Penicillium crustosum
Penicillium crustosum is a bluegreen or bluegrey mold that can cause food spoilage particularly of proteinrich foods such as meats and cheeses It is identified by its complex biseriate conidiophores on which phialides produce asexual spores It can grow at fairly low temperatures it is a psychrophile and in low water activity environments

Penicillium crustosum produces mycotoxins most notoriously the neurotoxic penitrems including the best known penitrem toxin penitrem A and including penitrems A through G Penitrem G has been shown to have insecticidal activity In addition P crustosum can produce thomitrems A and E and roquefortine C Consumption of foods spoiled by this mold can cause transient neurological symptoms such as tremors In dogs symptoms can include vomiting convulsion tremors ataxia and tachycardia

HexapodTelescope
The HexapodTelescope HPT is a CsedTestWord located at Cerro Armazones Observatory in northern Chile The RitcheyChrtien reflecting telescope is notable for the design of telescope mount Instead of the typical mounting where the telescope moves on two rotating axes the mirror end of the telescope is supported by six extensible struts an arrangement known as a Stewart platform This configuration allows the telescope to move in all six spatial degrees of freedom and also provides strong structural integrity As a result the ratio of bearing pressure and its own weight is very high Furthermore the sixleg structure allows for a very precise positioning and repeatability The disadvantage of the system is that controlling and aiming a hexapodmounted telescope is much more complex than with conventional telescope mounts

The mounting was designed by CsedTestWord of the CsedTestWord Vertex in CsedTestWord with astronomers of the Astronomy Institute of the Ruhr University Bochum AIRUB in Germany Led by Prof Rolf Chini the HPT was thoroughly tested at AIRUB In 2006 it was moved to its new location on Cerro Armazones Observatory in the Atacama Desert in Chile AIRUB in collaboration with the Astronomy Department of the Catholic University of the North UCN is developing an observatory there A new control building was built next to the HPT on the summit of Cerro Murphy a subsidiary peak of Cerro Armazones

Together with the Landessternwarte HeidelbergKnigstuhl AIRUB developed the Bochum Echelle Spectrograph for the Optical BESO for the HPT It is a copy of the Fiberfed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph FEROS operated by the European Southern Observatory

Agostino Codazzi
Giovanni Battista Agostino Codazzi alternatively known in Latin America as Agustn Codazzi 12 July 1793  7 February 1859 was an ItaloVenezuelan soldier scientist geographer cartographer and governor of Barinas 18461847 He made his main investigations and cartographic work in Venezuela and Colombia thereby creating for both countries a complete set of maps and statistics after the tumultuous postindependence years from the Spanish Empire

Codazzi was born in the Italian city of Lugo Since young he appreciated the ideals of the French Revolution and after his studies at the military academy Scuola di Artiglieria of Pavia actively served in the Napoleon Army

With the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 Codazzi moved away from Italy and after some travels went to Venezuela where he offered his military knowledge to Simon Bolivar

Successively he received the task of mapping the area of the Maracaibo Lake and the borders between Venezuela Colombia and Ecuador The Venezuelan government named him Colonel and ordered the creation of an Atlas of Venezuela a task that gave him international fame in Paris Codazzi was awarded in 1842 the Legion of Honor by the King of France on behalf of the French Academy of Science

Agustin Codazzi meanwhile took the Venezuelan citizenship from president Jos Antonio Pez and became Governor of Barinas a region of southwestern Venezuela In those years his academic activity of geographer was continuously interrupted by his duties as a military commander suffocating many revolts

Codazzi even promoted the creation in the 1840s of the Colonia Tovar a small German settlement in the Venezuelan central mountains that still exists today and has become one of the main tourist attractions near Maracay

With the fall of Pez after a military insurrection Codazzi was forced to escape to Ccuta Colombia where he continued his geographic and mapping activity with military duties for the Colombian government

In 1852 Codazzi did a scientific and cartographic inspection of Panama for the British government in 1854  even if with no official mention of Codazzis work the Panama Canal project was done following exactly his indications and route

Codazzi died of malaria in February 1859 at the small town of Espritu Santo in the Colombian mountains in the arms of his friend Manuel Mara Paz while he was mapping the area for the Comisin Corogrfica The town where he died has been renamed Aldea Codazzi and now is a city with a population of nearly 70000 inhabitants

Venezuela honored the memory of Agustin Codazzi placing his remains inside the National Pantheon of Venezuela in 1942 where he is considered one the Heroes of Venezuela

Quiescence search
Quiescence search is an algorithm typically used to evaluate minimax game trees in gameplaying computer programs It mitigates the effect of the horizon problem faced by AI engines for various games like chess and Go

Human players usually have enough intuition to decide whether to abandon a badlooking move or search a promising move to a great depth A quiescence search attempts to emulate this behavior by instructing a computer to search interesting positions to a greater depth than quiet ones to make sure there are no hidden traps and to get a better estimate of its value

Any sensible criterion may be used to distinguish quiet moves from noisy moves high activity high movement on a chess board extensive capturing in Go for example is commonly used for board games As the main motive of quiescence search is usually to get a good value out of an imperfect evaluation function it may also make sense to detect wide fluctuations in values returned by a simple heuristic evaluator over several ply Modern chess engines may search certain moves up to 2 or 3 times deeper than the minimum In highly unstable games like Go and reversi a rather large proportion of computer time may be spent on quiescence searching

The horizon effect is a problem in artificial intelligence which can occur when a search of a game tree is limited In many games the number of possible states or positions is too great for an exhaustive search to be practical Computer programs search a subset of the game tree and use heuristics to estimate the value of individual positions Due to the limitation of this search its possible for the computer to identify a move that is optimal up to the given search depth but that leads to a suboptimal position beyond that depth of which the computer is unaware Quiescence search attempts to mitigate this issue by extending the search depth in high activity positions where the heuristic value may have significant fluctuations between moves

ShellHaus
The ShellHaus Shell House is a classical modernist architectural masterpiece that stands overlooking the Landwehrkanal in the Tiergarten district of Berlin Germany It was designed by Emil Fahrenkamp and was built in 193031

In 1929 a competition was held between five architects to determine the designer of a prestigious new office block to house the headquarters of the mineral oil company and Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary RhenaniaOssag The victor was the German architect and professor Emil Fahrenkamp 18851966

After almost two years in construction ShellHaus opened in 1932 At the time the building was noted for its modernist design for its striking wavelike facade and for being one of the first steelframed highrise buildings in Berlin In retrospect it is regarded as Fahrenkamps masterpiece and one of the most significant office block designs of the Weimar Republic 

ShellHaus simple graceful forms are stylistically reminiscent of the German modern realist movement New Objectivity but Fahrenkamp also incorporated more traditional aspects to his design 

The most eyecatching feature of ShellHaus is its main facade which jumps forward in six gentle waves whilst at the same time increasing in height from six levels five at the back to ten The building itself comprises four wings situated around a foursided inner courtyard

Before the building of ShellHaus the Tiergarten section of Berlin was primarily the location of expensive elegant and luxurious private residences Afterwards and after World War II the area housed more offices with some of the former townhouses and villas gone and others having been converted to office use The street itself became a significant connecting thoroughfare

During the Second World War ShellHaus was used by the naval high command and the cellars were converted into a makeshift hospital 

Despite the upper floors being damaged in the Battle of Berlin at the close of the war ShellHaus was one of Berlins few great edifices to survive the widespread destruction of the city relatively unscathed After clearing away the war damage in 1946 the Berlin electricity board BEWAG made ShellHaus its head office 

In 1958 ShellHaus was designated an historical monument in order to protect it However this acknowledgement of its architectural importance did not save the building from postwar dilapidation and it remained in a degraded state for many years to follow

Between 1965 and 1967 the ShellHaus site was extended northwards with the construction of two similarly steelframed buildings designed by the German architect Paul Baumgarten Being comparatively conventional and unremarkable in design they were not included under the original buildings historical monument protection and a 1995 application to rectify this was squashed

When the subject of the buildings long overdue restoration was raised in the 1980s progress was hampered by a dispute over the investment needed that continued into the mid1990s Renovation work had been carried out on the courtyard faade in the early 80s but this had failed to meet the required standards

In 1995 Bewag moved out of ShellHaus in readiness for the renovation project In 1997 after 13 years of discord the restoration work began At the time the total cost was estimated at around 50 million deutschmarks but by the time work was completed in February 2000 the expenditure had escalated to around 80 million marks A major contributory factor to the considerable expense was the need to reopen the Longarina quarry near Rome owned by company CIMEP in Tivoli in order to supply the appropriate travertine rock for the building faade

The expenditure and painstaking detail invested in ShellHaus did not go unrewarded the year 2000 saw the renovation work awarded the monument preservation prize the Ferdinand von Quast Medal

In March 2000 the Berlin energy supplier GASAG became the new owner and occupant of ShellHaus

ShellHaus has several highprofile fans including the acclaimed German film director Wim Wenders  who featured the building in his 1970 directorial debut Summer in the City  and the architect Meinhard von Gerkan who said that for him it was the most beautiful building in Berlin

On the other hand one of the only times on record that Adolf Hitler inveighed against a specific building in Berlin as opposed to modern urban architecture in general was when he insulted Fahrenkamp with Youre the man who committed the crime of the Shell Building Despite this criticism Fahrenkamp received some commissions for exhibition buildings and had dealings with Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels Hermann Gring the head of the Luftwaffe and the Four Year Plan and Albert Speer Hitlers favorite architect and later Minister of Armaments and War Production

Revolution of the Park
The Revolution of the Park Revolucin del Parque also known as the Revolution of 90 was an uprising against the national government of Argentina that took place on July 26 1890 and started with the takeover of the Buenos Aires Artillery Park It was led by members of the Civic Union which would later give rise to the modern Radical Civic Union against the presidency of Miguel Jurez Celman of the National Autonomist Party Though it failed in its main goals the revolution forced Jurez Celmans resignation and marked the decline of the elite of the Generation of 80

Near the end of 1889 general discontent mainly due to high inflation encouraged the Civic Union led by Aristbulo del Valle and Leandro Alem to attempt to oust President Miguel Jurez Celman whose conservative rule like those of previous presidents had been marked by electoral fraud and corruption

The uprising was led by a civil revolutionary junta and by General Manuel J Campos It counted on the indirect support of General and former President Julio Argentino Roca and on the lack of opposition by General Bartolom Mitre
The uprising started on 26 July 1890 at the Buenos Aires Artillery Park It met with swift repression on the part of the government forces led by generals Carlos Pellegrini the VicePresident Roque Senz Pea and Nicols Lavalle Lacking initiative and ammunition the revolutionaries were defeated in a matter of days but the image of the government had suffered Senator Pizarro demanded the resignation of the entire Executive Branch and the Senate presided by General Roca but President Jurez Celman was the only one to accept VicePresident Pellegrini took office in his stead to complete the remaining two years of his presidential term 
The Revolution of the Park was intended as a means to avoid the ruin of the country by bringing down a government that represents illegality and corruption according to its Manifesto The revolutionary junta rejected living without voice or vote witness the disappearance of rules principles guarantees tolerate the usurpation of our political rights and keeping those in power who have wrought the disgrace of the republic and denounced that there is no republic no federal system no representative government no administration no morality Political life has turned into a forprofit industry 

The success of the revolution was limited to the resignation of Jurez Celman who had been notorious for his corruption and abuse of power The key elements outlined in its Manifesto however continued to be present in Argentine politics as shown by the series of uprisings Revolution of 1893 and Revolution of 1905

Mardale Ill Bell
Mardale Ill Bell is a fell in the English Lake District rising to the south west of Haweswater Reservoir It stands on the watershed between Mardale and Kentmere and is the highpoint of the southeastern ridge of High Street midway on its course to Harter Fell

The head of the Kentmere valley lies to the southwest of the fell with rough slopes leading down over scree to Kentmere Reservoir Mardale Ill Bell sends out a short grasstopped spur Lingmell End which splits the head of the valley into two

The northeastern face of Mardale Ill Bell forms the craggy backdrop to Blea Water This perfect corrie tarn is the deepest in the Lake District at 207ft Its outflow feeds Haweswater joining with that of a second tarn Small Water Between the two Mardale Ill Bell throws out the rocky spur of Piot Crag Two tiers of crag drop down to the confluence at Mardale Waters

Southeast of the summit a rough narrowing ridge drops to Nan Bield Pass at 2100ft before rising again over rocky steps to Harter Fell Nan Bield was the ancient trading route between Kentmere and the now drowned village of Mardale Green submerged by the raising of Haweswater in the 1940s Near the shore of Small Water on the descending path are a number of stone shelters pointers to the earlier importance of the pass These each provide refuge for one person in extremis entrance being via crawling

Northwest from Mardale Ill Bell the grassy ridge crosses a wet depression and then expands into a wide plateau triangular in plan High Street and Thornthwaite Crag are at the other two corners with the Roman road crossing north to south

The summit has two large cairns on grass the northern one being the top The view westwards is confined by higher fells but the Ill Bell ridge and Coniston range are seen to good effect Blea Water and Small Water can be brought into sight from the rim of the crags

The most popular routes of ascent are on the Mardale side From the road end Nan Bield pass can be used or the impressive scenery of Piot Crag can be attained from the shore of either Blea or Small Water From Kentmere Nan Bield provides the obvious route although a pathless climb up to the top of Lingmell End is possible

Snipe flies in the genus Rhagio are sometimes called downlooker flies after their habit of perching headdownward on tree trunks

The family is contained in Brachycera infraorder Tabanomorpha and several of its constituent groups have been recently elevated to family rank Atherix and related genera now comprise the Athericidae Vermileo and related genera now comprise the Vermileonidae and the genera Austroleptis and Bolbomyia are each now the sole members of their own families Austroleptidae and Bolbomyiidae The subfamily Spaniinae was sometimes accorded family rank but this is not accepted in the most recent revisionary classification

Sisymbrium irio
Sisymbrium irio known as London rocket is a plant in the family Brassicaceae It is an annual herb exceeding three feet in height with open slender stem branches The flowers are small with four pale yellow petals The basal leaves are broad and often lobed while the upper leaves are linear in shape and up to four inches long The fruit is a long narrow cylindrical silique which stays green when ripe The younger pods overtop the flowers When dried the fruit has small red oblong seeds
The common name London rocket allegedly comes from its abundance after the Great Fire of London in 1666 However Dr E J Salisbury in his study of the bombsites of London after the Great Fire of 1940 failed to find a single specimen nor has any other reliable observer reported it according to R S R Fitter

This species is considered a weed in the Southwestern United States and other regions where it has been introduced

The leaves seeds and flowers are edible with a spicy flavor similar to cultivated rocket London rocket is used in the Middle East to treat coughs and chest congestion to relieve rheumatism to detoxify the liver and spleen and to reduce swelling and clean wounds The Bedouin use the leaf of London Rocket as a tobacco substitute The cured pods can be placed in a basket with live coals and shaken until the pods are parched then ground into meal and made into soup or stew

Peter Laslett
Peter Laslett 18 December 1915  8 November 2001 was an English historian

Born Thomas Peter Ruffell Laslett and educated at the Watford Grammar School for Boys Peter Laslett studied history at St Johns College Cambridge in 1935 and graduated with a double first in 1938 During World War II he learned Japanese and worked at Bletchley Park and Washington decoding Japanese naval intelligence It was at Bletchley Park that he met his future wife Janet Crockett Clark whom he married in 1947

Returning to Cambridge in 1948 with a research fellowship at St Johns College Laslett edited Robert Filmers political writings Patriarcha and Other Political Writings 1949 According to noted historian JGA Pocock it was with this work that Laslett provided the initial inspiration for the Cambridge School of the history of political thought the methods of which are now widely practised throughout the profession Laslett combined such academic activity with a lifelong concern to engage a wider audience He worked simultaneously as a BBC radio producer for the Third Programme One product of this desire to reach a wider audience was his pathbreaking and highlypopular book The World We Have Lost England Before the Industrial Age 1965 US edition 1966 issued in a second edition in 1971 and in a retitled third revised edition The World We Have Lost Further Explored 1983 US edition 1984 Simon Mitton credits Laslett with having launched in 1948 the radio broadcasting career of the astronomer Fred Hoyle

In 1953 Laslett was appointed a university lecturer in history at Cambridge and was elected a fellow Trinity College in the same year He continued work in the history of political theory discovering Lockes library and demonstrating against the accepted account that John Lockes Two Treatises on Government had been written prior to the English Glorious Revolution of 16889 remarking that the Two Treatises is an Exclusion Tract not a Revolution Pamphlet Laslett published an edition of the treatises in 1960 subsequently reprinted many times which is now recognised as the definitive account of these pillars of modern liberal democracy From 1957 he founded and coedited Philosophy Politics and Society a series of collections on political philosophy

Laslett took up an entirely different line of historical research from the early 1960s Trying to understand 17thcentury listings of the inhabitants of Clayworth and Cogenhoe Northamptonshire he became persuaded of the need to pursue historical demography more systematically In 1964 Laslett and Tony Wrigley cofounded the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure With funding from the Social Science Research Council the Cambridge Group worked alongside amateur volunteers on local records and established the journal Local Population Studies

Lasletts practical reformism found an outlet from the 1960s in his efforts together with Michael Young to develop the Open University In 1963 he ran a series of 5 programmes on Anglia Television the Dawn University which attracted a great deal of attention although the funding had to wait two more years until Harold Wilson took up the idea

When told of his family history of Kent yeomen back to 1600 he looked it over and said Good Not a gentleman in 400 years

Laslett was Reader in Politics and the History of Social Structure at Cambridge University the title reflecting his own unusual mix of historical interests from 1966 until retirement in 1983 At this point his interests turned to the historical understanding and practical betterment of the elderly Laslett played a pivotal role in founding the University of the Third Age in 1982

He died in 2001 aged 85 and was interred at Wolvercote Cemetery in Oxford and was survived by his wife Janet sons George and Robert and grandchildren Vivian Alden and Claire His fine library of early printed books by and about Filmer Locke and political thought including political economy was sold by Quaritch in 2006

Juliana poem
Juliana Exeter Book fol 65b76a is one of the four signed poems ascribed to the mysterious poet Cynewulf and is an account of the martyring of St Juliana of Nicomedia The one surviving manuscript dated between 970 and 990 is preserved in the Exeter Book between the poems The Phoenix and The Wanderer Juliana is one of only five Old English poetic texts that describe the lives of saints The others include Elene Andreas and Guthlac A and B

Juliana is Cynewulfs second longest work totaling 731 lines However due to damage to the Exeter Book over timesuch as staining charring and the loss of pagesthere are two gaps in the text of Juliana amounting to a loss of 130 to 140 lines Through comparative analyses it has been determined that no more than a single page worth of material could be missing from either gap and it is therefore very likely that a single sheet which would have been folded in the middle to form two pages was accidentally lost when the original manuscript was being bound

Cynewulfs Juliana is presented entirely in Old English alliterative verse and is transmitted in a late WestSaxon dialect Cynewulf likely derived the poem from earlier Latin accounts of the same storysimilar to those appearing in the Acta sanctorum or the Martyrology however it is likely that Cynewulf was adapting his version from an unknown Latin source that has since been lost

The Juliana story takes place during the Diocletian persecution and was probably first set in writing during the rule of Constantine I The story begins by illustrating the harsh life for Christians under the rule of Galerius Maximian describing various acts of violence visited upon Christians Juliana is introduced as the daughter of Africanus of Nicomedia who has promised Julianas hand in marriage to Eleusias a wealthy senator and friend of Maximian Although Juliana was born a pagan she has converted to Christianity and so she vehemently resists being married to the pagan Eleusias not wanting to violate the relationship she shares with God

When she publicly voices her dissatisfaction Eleusias becomes outraged and insists that he has been publicly insulted Africanus upon hearing of this becomes similarly outraged believing his daughter has embarrassed him by refusing the hand of a man of much higher status As a result Africanus declares that Eleusias is free to punish Juliana in whatever way he wishes

Eleusias proceeds to have Juliana stripped naked hung from a tree by her hair whipped and beaten with rods for over two hours Then she is thrown into prison

While in prison Juliana is visited by a demon pretending to be an angel of God who tries to trick her into blasphemy Juliana being the epitome of unwavering Christian faith doesnt fall for the charade and prays to God for guidance A voice tells her to reach out and grab the demon and Juliana obeys

This point forward contains the bulk of the story in which Juliana and the demon have a lengthy war of words with Juliana clearly dominating She holds the demon and forces it to confess all of its wicked deeds several times over ostensibly humiliating him forever in the kingdom of Hell

After her victory over the visiting demon Eleusias comes back for Juliana and seems to offer her a chance to change her mind Not surprisingly Juliana refuses him once again and just as scathingly as before

Eleusias then attempts to have Juliana burned alive in hot lead Yet even though he has Juliana placed in the fire not a spot on her body or clothes is touched by the flames Angrier than ever Eleusias finally resolves to have Juliana beheaded for which she becomes a Christian martyr

The entire story as told by Cynewulf deviates little from the Latin source he likely used with the same progress of action and phraseology observed in both texts However there are some unsubtle differences worth mentioning One is that the character of Eleusius is portrayed in Cynewulfs text with a much more sinister and intolerant manner to his behaviour In the Acta Sanctorum Eleusius is presented as an easygoing man willing to accept Christianity just as long as he is not baptized a practice that would compromise his position as a powerful senator

In Cynewulfs version however Eleusias eagerly worships the heathen gods and his faith in the devilinspired idols is equitable to Julianas faith in her own Christian God Thus Cynewulf polarizes Juliana and Eleusius in a way that is analogous to the conflict of good and evil In fact Cynewulf may have been trying to play on an AngloSaxon idea of a social construct called a dryht The argument goes that according to AngloSaxon ethos a good king is a provider who earns the loyalty of those he governs Cynewulf could have used this notion to illustrate a clear difference between Julianas God the good king and Satanpagan gods the bad king This is evident in the fact that Juliana is repeatedly guided and protected with the one exception of the beheading while the demon an agent of Satan is coerced into serving his master and is offered no guidance or protection

A further difference to be noted between Cynewulfs Juliana and its counterpart in the Acta Sanctorum include the authors omission of Julianas insistence that she will only marry Eleusius if he becomes a prefect This was likely left out by Cynewulf to show Juliana as a polished saint and further magnify her polarization to Eleusius There is also an important stylistic difference attributed to the adaptation efforts of Cynewulf namely the importing of military or battlefield language into the story Although this is a recurring theme in both Latin and Old English literature the military language does not appear in the Latin counterparts such as the Acta Sanctorum and so it is believed that Cynewulf probably wove it in for two possible reasons the first being to make Juliana easier to relate to the second to create the metaphor that Julianas spirit was a sort of impenetrable fortress impervious to the attacks of Satan and his demonic henchmen

It is said that Cynewulfs Juliana seems to lack the emotional vigour and imagination of some of the poets other compositions The language is thought to be less elaborate but still maintains the rhetorical cunning that Cynewulf is accustomed to As in his Elene the Old English tradition of placing the characters and events of the story in a heroic setting is upheld Juliana is celebrated as a martyr who defeats the advances of the devil The idea of a woman figuring prominently in a tale such as this was not new to AngloSaxons Germanic literature often permitted women to play instrumental roles in the heroic setting of events For instance through Bedes writings we hear of such women providing the stimulus for political and religious developments in Britain

Jinzhou Operation
The Jinzhou Chinchow Operation was an operation in 1931 during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria which was a preliminary contributing factor to the outbreak of the Second SinoJapanese War in 1937

In late November 1931 Imperial Japanese Army commander in chief General Shigeru Honj dispatched 10000 soldiers in 13 armored trains escorted by a squadron of bombers in an advance on Jinzhou from Mukden This force advanced to within 30 kilometers of Chinchow when it received an order to withdraw The operation was cancelled by Japanese War Minister General Jir Minami due to the acceptance of modified form of a League of Nations proposal for a neutral zone to be established as a buffer zone between the Republic of China proper and Manchuria pending a future ChinaJapanese peace conference by the civilian government of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijir in Tokyo

However the two sides failed to reach a lasting agreement The Wakatsuki government soon fell and was replaced by a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai Further negotiations with the Kuomintang government failing the Japanese government approved an increase in the military forces in Manchuria In December the rest of the 20th Infantry Division along with the 38th Mixed Brigade of the 19th Infantry Division were sent into Manchuria from Korea while the 8th Mixed Brigade 10th Infantry Division was sent from Japan

Following the defeat of General Ma Zhanshan in Heilongjiang province and in anticipation of reinforcements a new Japanese offensive was launched in Manchuria on December 21 General Honjo insisted that his troops were moving out to clear the country of bandits and added that the Chinese evacuation of Chinchow was absolutely imperative Most of the bandits were actually the organizing AntiJapanese Volunteer Armies but some real bandits were also exploiting the chaos following the collapse of the Chinese government and its Northeastern Army following the Mukden Incident and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria

While the other Japanese forces and collaborationist Manchurian troops spread out from their bases along the South Manchurian Railway rail lines to clear the countryside from Mukden the Japanese headquarters in Manchuria the brigades of the 12th Infantry Division advanced southward in the night supported by squadrons of Japanese bombers to force the Chinese to evacuate Jinzhou

The Japanese estimated the Chinese at Jinzhou had 84000 defenders with 58 artillery pieces placed to support two separate systems of entrenchments defending the city The Chinese first defensive line 20 miles north of the city was a series of trenches aimed to stop the Japanese advance at the Taling River Bridge on the PeipingMukden Railway The Chinese had a second line of earthworks and entrenchments completely encircling Jinzhou to fall back on if the Japanese forces broke through the first line

Japanese Lieutenant General Jir Tamons troops cautiously advanced south from Mukden The temperature was 30 below zero and Japanese forces were camouflaged in white Japanese reconnaissance aircraft reported a force of at least 3000 Chinese bandits waiting to defend Panshan County Brushing aside these Chinese skirmishers in a series of minor clashes Tamon prepared to meet and crush the first serious Chinese resistance expected at Goubangzi 50 kilometers north of Jinzhou

By the evening of December 31 1931 the Japanese advance guard was fifteen kilometers from Jinzhou on the banks of the Taling river General Tamon halted briefly to bring up the rest of his 2nd Division for the final drive on Jinzhou The Japanese War Office announced in a radio broadcast The Battle of the Taling River setting up microphones behind the Japanese lines arranging an elaborate hookup to broadcast the sound of firing to Tokyo but then had to call off the broadcast when the Chinese retreated without giving combat

Japanese forces occupied Jinzhou on January 3 1932 with the local populace waving Japanese flags homemade during the night to appease the conquerors

On the Chinese side confusion reigned The old government of Chiang Kaishek at Nanjing had resigned and a new one under Premier Sun Fo had been formed Additionally Marshal Zhang Xueliangs defenders were in disorderly retreat toward the Great Wall leaving only a small garrison to protect the few government functionaries who remained behind At Nanjing Eugene Chen the new Kuomintang Foreign Minister asserted that his government had never ordered evacuation of Jinzhou but on the contrary had ordered Marshal Zhang repeatedly to stand his ground Nine Chinese generals in various parts of China denounced Premier Sun Fos new government blaming it for the humiliating loss of Jinzhou without a struggle

The day after the fall of Jinzhou the Imperial Japanese Army occupied Shanhaiguan thus completing its military control over south Manchuria

Charisma film
The film is about a dispute between a number of people about a unique but possibly toxic tree growing in an unnamed forest The film is largely seen from the point of view of Goro Yabuike Kji Yakusho a police negotiator who has been relieved of his duties following his failure to prevent the death of an important hostage He stands in the middle of the conflicting opinions about the future of the tree and has to decide which course to commit himself to

Goro Yabuike is a hostage negotiator He attends an incident where an MP is being held at gunpoint The captors ransom note reads Restore the Rules of the World When Yabuike has a chance to shoot the hostagetaker he hesitates The captor kills the MP and is in turn killed by the police Afterwards Yabuike explains that he thought he could help both men He is suspended from duty

He is dropped off in the middle of a mysterious forest He comes across various people who are in a dispute about an apparently unique tree named Charisma growing in a clearing in the forest Jinbo believes the plant is toxic will eventually kill the whole forest She wants to poison the tree so that the forest can be restored to its original condition Kiriyama a former sanatorium patient wants to protect the tree even if this leads to the death of the rest of the forest Other military figures want to take the tree away for a collector

Yabuike becomes the central figure in the dispute somehow able to decide what will happen After the tree has been stolen by the milias recaptured by Kiriyama with Yabuikes help and burned by Jinbo a new bigger tree appears possibly similar to Charisma Yabuike mulls over the two choices he faces saving the individual tree or saving the whole forest He decides that the dichotomy is a false one First that life and death are part of the same force and second that every tree is a special tree and together they are a forest but simultaneously no tree signifies anything more than any other Ultimately some will live and some will die and some will be killed and some will be saved

When the head of the militia takes Jinbo hostage Yabuike has no hesitation in shooting though not killing him The final scene shows Yabuike making his way back to the city to seek treatment for the injured militia In the distance the city can be seen in flames


The screenplay originally written in the early 1990s earned Kiyoshi Kurosawa a scholarship from the Sundance Institute to study filmmaking at the United States

Charisma was shown at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival It was later released in Japan on February 26 2000

Kris Nelson of Dreamlogicnet gave the film a favorable review noting that the soundtrack is perfect The film has been interpreted by some as an allegorical tale about the structure of Japanese society and the tension between the importance of individuality on the one hand and the importance of the group on the other It is also possible to discern an ecological message Travis Mackenzie Hoover of Exclaim said with its combination of Tarkovskian natural wonder Beckett absurdity and good old fashioned movie lan its guaranteed that youll care enough to see into its deeply troubled heart of darkness

Harold F Clayton
Harold Fooshee Clayton May 9 1954  May 26 2015 was a noted sculptor and stonecarver best known for several sets of lifesize sculptures of cows on display at various public sites in Texas

Initially interested in painting Clayton studied art at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston Massachusetts and the University of North Texas in Denton Texas graduating cum laude with a BFA in 1977 He moved to stone as a medium and spent the years from 1982 to 1987 in Pietrasanta Italy studying carving in the studio of Sem Ghelardini

While still in Italy Clayton accepted a commission for four sets of five marble cows from for the Trammell Crow Company a large Dallas real estate development concern Three of the sets now stand in Texas at the Arboretum at Great Hills in Austin at Las Colinas in Irving and at Trinity Lake Park in Dallas The fourth set is in Milwaukee Wisconsin A sculpture of a half completed cow emerging from stone sits in the front yard of Claytons former home in Dallas

The cows at these sites stand where live cows actually grazed in the recent past In fact the models for the sculptures were made in 1980 from cows standing on the hill where the Las Colinas cows now appear to graze Each cow required four tons of marble The cows at the Arboretum site are much loved by children

Clayton maintained a workshop in Dallas and was a member of the Stone Carvers Guild He died of lung cancer in 2015

Nuna 3
The Nuna 3 is a solar car developed by Nuon Solar Team form the Delft University of Technology in 20042005 for the 2005 World Solar Challenge

It succeeded the Nuna2 the solar car that scored a second consecutive win for this solar team by winning the World Solar Challenge for the third time in a row

Nuna 3 was one of the favourites for the 2005 edition of the World Solar Challenge with a prerace testdrive recorded top speed of 130kmh The final result was that the 3021 kilometers between Darwin and Adelaide were covered in a record 29 hours and 11 minutes averaging about 103kmh

It has very efficient solar cells of a type normally used to power orbital satellites as had the previous Nunas and it has better aerodynamics and is lighter than its predecessors

It was designed and built by 11 students from different disciplines of the Delft University of Technology who have partly put their studies on hold for this They used the hightech labs and workshops of the University and as with the Nuna 2 they received advice from Wubbo Ockels the first Dutch astronaut and professor at the University

To have a good chance to win the car has to

The solar cells are made of gallium arsenide GaAs and consist of three layers Sunlight that penetrates the upper layer is used in the lower layers resulting in an efficiency of over 26 This type of solar cell is among the best available currently Apart from efficiency size also matters so the entire upper surface of the Nuna 3 is covered with them except for the cockpit

Efficiency is optimal when the cells are hit by the solar rays perpendicularly If not output is reduced by roughly the cosine of the angle with the perpendicular Because the 2005 race was held in September as opposed to October or November in previous years the sun was lower in the sky its earlier in spring To compensate for this as many cells as possible were placed at the sides most notably on the wheel caps
A solar cell gives a certain amount of current for a certain amount of sunlight The voltage depends on the load more precisely the resistance of the load The power is the product of voltage and current and therefore also depends on the load Over a certain voltage the current of the solar cell quickly drops to zero as the graph illustrates

However the batteries have a fairly constant voltage which also has a rather different value than that of the solar cells So a voltage transformation is needed A special type of DCDC converter is used to ensure the load resistance presented to the solar cells is such that the solar cells give maximum power so also at the top of the green line in the graph This is called a Maximum power point tracker MPPT Here too the goal is to have this conversion achieve maximum efficiency 97

The aerodynamic drag is an important part of the total resistance Important are the frontal surface and the streamline Any deviation from the ideal streamline will cause turbulence which costs energy The ideal streamline is achieved in various stages
From meteorological data from the area where the contest is to take place it can be concluded that there will likely be a strong sidewind The wheel caps of the Nuna 3 are designed such that a sidewind will have a propulsory effect

The electromotor is totally encased in the rear wheel to minimise loss through mechanical transmission from motor to wheel such as in a normal car in the gear box and cardan The motor is an improved version of the original 1993 Motor of the Spirit of Biel III by the Engineering School of Biel Switzerland now Berner Fachhochschule Technik und Informatik The improvements are due to completely redeveloped digital power electronics and control realized 1999 They allowed for 50 more power over 2400 W and a 45 higher torque compared to the 1993 Spirit of Biel II The efficiency of the total drive system including the power electronics losses is also improved and is now over 98 But as the graph shows this depends somewhat on the speed and increases with speed The design was initially made to reach its maximum performance at the normal cruising speed of the solar car at around 100kmh

During one of the test drives in the Netherlands the Nuna 3 achieved a speed of 130kmh On the first day of the race the car achieved a top speed of 140kmh For comparison the Sunraycer the first winner of the Solar Challenge race attained a top speed of 109kmh in 1987

The winner of the North American Solar Challenge from the University of Michigan USA was considered to be one of the most important opponents Other important contestants were the MIT also USA and the Japanese Ashiya University team In 2005 there were also two other European contestants the Dutch Raedthuys Solar Team from the University of Twente and the Belgian Umicore Solar Team from Leuven


This average speed which could lead to maximum speeds of 140kmh speeds on downhill section well exceeding speed limits on the Australian highway has led to rules changes for future races

Skweeze Me Pleeze Me
Skweeze Me Pleeze Me is a song by the British rock band Slade released in 1973 as a nonalbum single It was written by lead vocalist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea and produced by Chas Chandler It reached No 1 in the UK giving the band their fifth number one single and remained in the charts for ten weeks The song was certified UK Silver by BPI in July 1973 The song would be included on the bands 1973 compilation album Sladest

Earlier in 1973 Slade achieved their fourth number one Cum On Feel the Noize which was also the bands first single to reach the number one spot in its first week This achievement had not been seen since The Beatles Get Back in 1969 While on tour in America the band entered AM Studios in Los Angeles to record the followup single Skweeze Me Pleeze Me Released in June 1973 the song also reached the top spot in its first week It remained at No 1 for three consecutive weeks and sold 300000 copies in its first week of release

Lea originally had the idea for the chorus of Skweeze Me Pleeze Me after visiting the bands regular pub The Trumpet in Bilston where he saw local pianist Reg Kierle performing there During the release of the song drummer Don Powell was involved in a nearfatal car crash in July briefly throwing the bands existence into doubt Despite his critical condition Powell was able to make a recovery and the band entered the studio to record material for their next album Old New Borrowed and Blue later in the year

Skweeze Me Pleeze Me was released on 7 vinyl by Polydor Records in the UK Ireland across Europe Scandinavia Australia New Zealand South Africa Israel Argentina and Japan In America it was released by Reprise Records The Bside Kill Em at the Hot Club Tonite was exclusive to the single and would later appear on the bands 2007 compilation BSides The band had briefly considered releasing the Bside as a novelty single however Powells car crash caused the idea to be scrapped In America the Bside was the Old New Borrowed and Blue album track My Town

Due to Powells car crash no music video was filmed to promote the single The band appeared twice on the UK music show Top of the Pops prior to Powells crash Afterwards the producers of the show would not allow Slade to perform as a threepiece band so future airings of the song showed studio audience dancing to the song instead Prior to Powells crash the band also performed the song along with its Bside on the UK TV show Lift off with Ayesha

Upon release Record Mirror commented on Holders vocals as being given a satisfactory showcase Although they felt the song was not dissimilar to the bands previous material they added that rolling rhythm pushes the whole thing along with alarming verve and gusto New Musical Express said The start is fussy and those whoawhoas in the chorus are a drag The beats strong and the words in the verses are the best yet but all around this doesnt beat Mama Weer All Crazee Now or Gudbuy TJane American magazine Cash Box listed the single as one of their picks of the week during November 1973 They felt the song represented usual hard driving fare from the band and predicted it would give them their first major Stateside hit

Akysis
Akysis is the largest genus of catfishes order Siluriformes of the family Akysidae

In 1996 it was determined that Akysis is the sister group to all other akysids then only including Parakysis Acrochordonichthys and Breitensteinia However it was acknowledged that the genus Akysis was poorlysampled at the time and may be deemed nonmonophyletic in the future

In 1998 it was recognized that the large genus Akysis includes two species groups The first species group was the Akysis variegatus group for species more closely related to the type species the other group was the pseudobagarius group for species more closely related to the formerlynamed Akysis pseudobagarius the authors recognized it as conceivable that the groups represented two genera but tentatively retained the species in a single genus Since then the genus Pseudobagarius was erected for this species group leaving only members of the A variegatus group in the genus Akysis

In 2007 Laguvia manipurensis was redescribed to the genus Akysis as part of the A variegatus group

There are currently 24 recognized species in this genus

These fish are found in fastflowing streams in Southeast Asia This area is bordered by the Irrawaddy River drainage to the west the Barito River drainage to the east the Lancangjiang upper Mekong drainage to the north and the Citarum River drainage to the south Akysis have been reported from Java Sumatra Borneo Tenasserim Thailand Myanmar and most recently the distribution of Akysis has been discovered to include India

These small catfish can be distinguished by their general colouring of yellow markings on a brown background Fishes of the genus Akysis are diagnosed by having tough leathery skin covered with tubercles which are arranged in longitudinal rows along the sides the anterior margin of the pectoral spine with a notch visible dorsally the nasals with expansions beyond the canalbearing teeth and no palatal teeth These fish are distinguished from the members of the genus Pseudobagarius by a number of characteristics these species have a terminal mouth the posterior and anterior nostrils being smaller and located further apart with a distance between the base of the nasal barbel and anterior nostril the anterior nostrils are situated at the tip of a short tube and the caudal fin is truncate or emarginate rathern that forked

The maximum adult size of Akysis species is less than 70millimetres 28in SL

Catfishes of the genus Akysis are small crypticallycoloured species Akysis are small secretive fishes that occupy a variety of habitats Most species typically inhabit clear swiftflowing upland streams with sandy or rocky substrates Some species are reported from the muddy side and main channels and deltas of large rivers In smaller streams they may be found hiding in leaf litter and woody debris in patches of live vegetation such as Cryptocoryne affinis or in shallow riffle areas under coarse gravel or larger stones Species of Akysis also are reported from the shallow margins to the bottom depths of large rivers where they are usually taken in trawls together with decaying vegetation

PiedduCourant Prison
The PiedduCourant Prison is a building in Montreal Quebec near the Saint Lawrence River and the JacquesCartier Bridge

The original plan for a prison in Montreal was designed by Quebec architect George Blaiklock in 1825 to replace the prison at Champ de Mars built in the first decade of the 19th Century but John Wells ultimately designed the building after a prison in Philadelphia likely the Eastern State Penitentiary built in 1829 that was finally opened a decade later The building was built to house over 276 prisoners but held over 1500 prisoners from the 18371838 rebellion The prison operated from 1836 to 1912 as a city prison in Montreal and housed prisoners and hangings following the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1838

The prison was replaced by Bordeaux Prison and was vacant from 1912 to 1921 In 1921 it was acquired by and became the headquarters of the Socit des alcools du Qubec the provincialowned liquor board in Quebec

The main prison building was altered with the Gable roof on the front of centre block removed a fourth floor added replacing roofing and new wing added to the rear by SAQ The west wall in the front was demolished leaving the gate and east wall intact

It saw the incarceration and execution by hanging of several Patriotes who had fought the Lower Canada Rebellion Because of this it also houses a museum on the history of the Patriotes and a gathering is usually held there on National Patriote Day Upon the front of its site is found the Monument aux Patriotes by sculptor Alfred Lalibert The whole of Pierre Falardeaus film February 15 1839 happens at the Prison

The monument is located in the Place of the Patriots which is in front of the Socit des alcools du Qubec offices and the site of the old PiedduCourant Prison

The work of Alfred Lalibert the Monument aux Patriotes was unveiled on June 24 1926 On each its three faces a carved bronze medallion represents patriots Chevalier de Lorimier LouisJoseph Papineau and Wolfred Nelson

Sikandar Bagh
Sikandar Bagh   formerly known by the British as SikunderSikandraSecundra Bagh is a villa and garden enclosed by a fortified wall with loopholes gateway and corner bastions approx 150 yards square c  located in the city of Lucknow Oudh Uttar Pradesh India It was built by the last Nawab of Oudh Wajid Ali Shah 18221887 as a summer residence The name of the villa signifies Garden of Sikandar perhaps after Alexander the Great whose name lives on in this form in these parts compare Alexandria Egypt in Arabic 
AlIskandariya or perhaps after Sikandar Mahal Begum the Nawabs favourite wife It was stormed in 1857 by the British during the Indian Rebellion and witnessed within its walls the slaughter of all 2200 sepoy mutineers who had made it a stronghold during their Siege of Lucknow The site now houses the National Botanical Research Institute of India

The garden was laid out in about 1800 as a royal garden by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan It was later improved upon by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah the last native ruler of Oudh during the first half of the 19th century who used it as his summer villa The garden has a small pavilion in the middle which was likely the scene of innumerable performances of the Raslilas and Kathak dances music and poetic mehfils and other cultural activities which the last Nawab had a great appreciation for indeed possibly too great a one as history has judged him to have been overfond of his leisure interests

During the Indian Rebellion the Sikander Bagh was used as one of many strongholds of sepoy mutineers during their siege of the British Residency in Lucknow It stood in the way of the CommanderinChief Sir Colin Campbells planned route to relieve the besieged Residency 

On the morning of 16 November 1857 whilst passing by its eastern side in a southerly direction in a sunken lane the British force was surprised and stopped in its tracks by overwhelmingly heavy fire coming from the Sikander Bagh A staff officer remarked to a comrade If these fellows allow one of us to get out of this culdesac alive they deserve every one of them to be hanged The cavalry were jammed together unable to advance and the high banks on either side seemed to offer an impassable barrier to artillery However Blunt of the Bengal Horse Artillery led his troop and conquering the impossible brought them with their guns into an open space to the east of the Sikandar Bagh galloping through enemy fire Here he unlimbered with remarkable coolness and selfpossession The six guns opened fire on the Sikandar Bagh Sappers and miners demolished part of the earth banks which allowing two 18pounder heavy guns of Traverss battery of the Artillery Brigade to be brought up out of the lane After half an hour of bombardment from a range of only  an aperture was created in the southeast angle of the wall in a brickedup doorway an ugly blind hole about square and off the ground Although only large enough to admit a single man with difficulty it was immediately rushed under heavy fire by some of the 93rd Highlanders and some men of the 4th Punjab Infantry 4th PI under Lieutenant McQueen 14 managing to enter the Sikaddar Bagh 

At the same time the rest of the 4th PI under Lieutenant Paul assaulted the gateway The gate was in the process of being closed by the mutineers when Subadar Mukarab Khan 4th PI a Pathan of Bajaur one of the leading men of the attack thrust his left arm and shield between its folds thus preventing it being shut and barred Though his left arm was wounded he still managed to keep his shield between the folds by holding it with his right hand until the door was forced This took place whilst Lt McQueens party and some of the Highlanders who had entered by the breach came from the rear of the many defenders of the gateway After a long handtohand struggle the British forced their way in greater numbers into the Sikandar Bagh through the gate and through the breach which had been enlarged by the sappers Slowly forced back the main body of about 2000 mutineers took refuge in a large 2storied building and the highwalled enclosure behind it The 2 doors to the enclosure were assaulted by the 4th PI Lt McQueen led the assault against the right gate and Lt Willoughby tackled the left The defenders had expected an attack from the opposite quarter and had bricked up the door to their rear and in doing so blocked their retreat After a long struggle they were all slain no quarter being given With cries such as Cawnpore You bloody murderers it was clear that the British attackers blamed these mutineers for the slaughter of European civilians earlier in the Mutiny including women and children particularly during the Siege of Cawnpore which caused outrage throughout British India and in Britain Lord Roberts who witnessed the assault later recalled Inch by inch they were forced back to the pavilion and into the space between it and the north wall where they were all shot or bayoneted There they lay in a heap as high as my head a heaving surging mass of dead and dying inextricably entangled It was a sickening site one of those which even in the excitement of battle and the flush of victory make one feel strongly what a horrible side there is to war The wounded men could not get clear of their dead comrades however great their struggles and those near the top of this ghastly pile vented their rage and determination on every British officer who approached by showering upon him abuse of the foulest description

Those killed or wounded during the assault included 9 officers and 90 men of the 93rd Highlanders and 3 officers and 69 men from the 4th Punjabi Infantry

Key 1 Position of 18pounder guns 2 Breach made in wall 3 Gateway 4 Bastion stormed from inside by 4th Punjab Infantry Regt cutting off enemys retreat 5 Centre pavilion with verandah 6 Onestoried building overlooking whole garden with own courtyard behind 7 East bastion exploded killing Lt Paul in command of 4th PI 8 Spot occupied by Sir Colin Campbell CinC and Staff from 18 to 22 November

After the fighting the British and loyal native Punjab Infantry dead were buried in a deep trench Later elephants were used to drag the corpses of the mutineers out of the Sikandar Bagh where they were slightly covered over in a ditch which they themselves had recently dug outside the north wall in order to strengthen the defences

The 4th Punjab Infantry remained quartered in the Sikandar Bagh until Lucknow was evacuated by the British 11 days later on 27 November while the CommanderinChief and his staff occupied a site to the west of the gate under the south wall from 18 to 22 November 

In early 1858 Felice Beato photographed the Sikandar Bagh showing skeletal remains strewn across the grounds of the interior These were apparently disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photographs dramatic impact

It is said that more Victoria Crosses were awarded for that single day than ever many for the assault on the Sikandar Bagh 
The recipients were as follows


Sgt Samuel Hill and Major John Guise  for going to the aid of wounded elected by the regiment





Articles such as cannonball swords and shields parts of muskets and rifles dug out of the garden over the years are now displayed in the NBRI Exhibition and scars from cannonball on the old walls of the garden still bear witness to the event

Another visible reminder of the battle is the statue erected some years ago in the old campus of the garden of Uda Devi a Pasi a Dalit community lady who fought side by side with the besieged mutineers Attired in male battle dress she had perched herself atop a tree in the garden gun in hand and kept the British attackers at bay until her ammunition was exhausted upon which she dropped dead to the ground her body riddled with bulletsAs far as the legend goes Uda Devi was one of the female bodyguards of Nawab Wajid Ali ShahShe was fiercely dedicated to her master Trained in martial Arts and espionage she also learned the art of guerrilla warfare and fought with her gun till the last bullet The British were also surprised and stunned by her marksmanship until she was spotted by the soldiers who fired relentlessly at her till she died from her wounds

Giulio Cesare Polerio
Giulio Cesare Polerio c 1550 Lanciano  c 1610 Rome reconstruction of places and dates by Adriano Chicco was an Italian chess theoretician and player

Name affixes used for him are lApruzzese Giuolio Cesare da Lanciano SalvioWalker and Lancianese because he was born in Lanciano a town in the Chieti province of the Abruzzo region of Italy

The first printed matter in which the name Giulio Cesare da Lanciano occurs is the socalled Il Puttino of Alessandro Salvio first published in 1634 The story recounted in Il Puttino must have occurred around 1575 thus published by Salvio some 60 years later Il Puttino altramente detto il Cavaliere errante is a nickname used by Alessandro Salvio for Giovanni Leonardo According to Alessandro Salvio Giulio Cesare da Lanciano accompanied Giovanni Leonardo on his way to Madrid until Genoa

After returning to Rome around 1584 Polerio became a chess player and writer in ordinary of Giacomo Boncompagni Duke of Sora and son of Pope Gregory XIII born Ugo Boncompagni

Polerio wrote a number of codexes in which a lively international chess is described exchanges of ideas among Italy Portugal and Spain In these codexes besides of own and new ideas in chess openings some matches played by himself are noted by the hand of Polerio

In the Puttino Salvio mentions that starting in 1606 from Citt di Piazza after a long travel on his way to Rome p43  p44 il detto Signor Cascio poi andando a Roma vinse Giulio Cesare compagno del Puttino il primo a Roma in casa dellEccelenza del Sig Giacobo Buoncompagno Duca di Sora this Mr Geronimo Cascio on his way to Rome beat Giulio Cesare Polerio companion of Il Puttino the best in Rome in the housecourt of his Excellence Giacomo Boncompagni Duke of Sora

The first systematic investigation of the Codexes of Polerio was published by Antonius van der Linde in 1874 The subject of the investigations by Van der Linde can be found at the Bibliotheca Van der LindeNiemeijeriana part of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek National Library of the Netherlands

The current systematics of the Codexes of Polerio has been performed and published by Alessandro Sanvito in 2005

The systematic organisation of overall seven Codexes described and called AG by Van der Linde and attributed to Polerio in 1874 had major impact on the further description of chess history and history of chess theory A relevant part of the work of Van der Linde was to compare Codexes of Polerio and Gioacchino Greco even superfine According to this investigation most of the analytic work of Polerio was mediated outside of Italy up to 1874 via Gioacchino Greco The clue which potentially could link both chess players may be seen in the person Giacomo Boncompagni or the Duchy of Sora respectively

On p186 of Das Schachspiel des XVI Jahrhunderts van der Linde wrote in 1874

6 Dd1f3 e cosi ancor che habbia perso un pezzo resta con buonissima postura di poter uencere il gioco sapendo guidarlo  presso il che sarebbe superfluo inogni modo se si uolesse mostrare la fine di tutti giochi e per questo basta insino  un certo che tanto che si conosca apartemente il uantagio del gioco si come per la postura di dette giochi ogni giudicioso giocatore lo potr facilmente cognoscere

 in modern terms

Polerio Gambit 1 e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3 Nf3 g5 4Bc4 g4 500 gxf3 6Qxf3 

Exactly this move order was also found later even in a second Polerio Codex discovered and described by JA Leon in 1894
Of note is that the position after 1e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3Nf3 g5 4Bc4 g4 500 gxf3 6Qxf3 may be considered by most recent grandmasters as a forced win for White  provided that 500 would mean free castling ie bringing the White King from e1 to h1 Actually Polerio did claim 500 gxf3 6Qxf3 to be favourable for White although the white king of Polerio did stand after 500 on h1 but not on g1 ie castling as defined in our days

However in 1874 the move order 1e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3Nf3 g5 4Bc4 g4 500 was already occupied by the term Muzio Gambit This term derives from a translation of a work of Alessandro Salvio supposedly the third book of the reprint of 1723 by Sarrat in 1813 On page 209 Jacob Henry Sarratt translated and wrote

SALVIO states that the following Gambit was sent to him by Signor Muzio 

Actually Alessandro Salvio never stated this Rather in the third book of the Il Puttino he wrote that Signor Mutio dAlessandro did see that Geronimo Cascio did play the move order with free castling also called Italian method of castling

With p 165 vol 2 of the 1821 edition of A New Treatise of the Game of Chess the term Muzio Gambit was coined by Jacob Henry Sarratt And with the latter work of Sarrat in 1821 the modern theory of the Muzio Gambit with castling according modern rules started  an idea and a position already Polerio analysed in 157980

Thus Antonius van der Linde changed the view on the historical development of the move order 1e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3Nf3 g5 4Bc4 g4 500 in 1874 most notably in the last editions of the Handbuch Thereafter a trend can be seen to call this move order either with hyphenated terms such as MuzioPolerio PolerioMuzio or simply Polerio Gambit Such a terminology is both in honour of Giulio Cesare Polerio and partially misleading since the major body of the theory of this opening was generated in the time span inbetween 1821 and 1874 The number of games played by Adolf Anderssen Paul Morphy and Wilhelm Steinitz with 1e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3Nf3 g5 4Bc4 g4 500 or 5d4 in the time span 18211874 was already rather high The rules for Chess opening nomenclature and their historical development should be taken into account while assessing van der Lindes claim of 1874 D PolerioGambit

In 1874 Van der Linde suggested as well p188 to rename the move order 1e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3Nf3 g5 4Bc4 Bg7 5h4 h6 6d4 d6 7Nc3 c6 8hxg5 hxg5 9Rxh8 Bxh8 10Ne5 into Polerios second Gambit This suggestion is based on the observation that im Handbuch 1864 S 366  3 this move order is called das Gambit des Calabresen This is a rather interesting observation since in the Handbuch in its 2nd edition as of 1852 on p 205 it is mentioned that the move order 1e4 e5 2Bc4 f5 can be found at the Calabrese Thats a rather wise wording since both 1e4 e5 2Bc4 f5 and 1e4 e5 2Nf3 f5 according to Codexes of Polerio occurred in games of Gio Leonardo games 236238 p190 in van der Linde Both Giovanni Leonardo and Gioacchino Greco derived from Calabria the first from Cutro the second from Celico

        Androgen replacement therapy
        Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

        ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

        Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

        The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

        Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

        The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

        On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

        There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

        Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

        Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

        As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

        In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

        A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

        Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

        Marathon Rowing Championship
        The Marathon Rowing Championship is a continuous rowing regatta on the Cane River Lake in Natchitoches Louisiana Northwestern State University is the official host of the regatta The Marathon begins near the Melrose Plantation and ends at Front Street in Natchitoches The regatta is open to all sculling and sweepoar rowing boats On the day of the Marathon the Cane River is open only to competitors

        The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

        The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

        The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

        Pterodactyloidea
        Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

        Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

        In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

        Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

        A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

        There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
        Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

        14Butynediol
        14Butynediol is an organic compound that is an alkyne and a diol It is a colourless hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water and polar organic solvents It is a commercially significant compound in its own right and as a precursor to other products

        14Butynediol can be produced in the Reppe synthesis where formaldehyde and acetylene are the reactants

        Several patented production methods use copper bismuth catalysts coated on an inert material The normal temperature range for the reaction is 90C up to 150C depending on the pressure used for the reaction which can range from 1 to 20 bar

        14Butynediol is a precursor to 14butanediol and 2butene14diol by hydrogenation It is also used in the manufacture of certain herbicides textile additives corrosion inhibitors plasticizers synthetic resins and polyurethanes It is the major raw material used in the synthesis of vitamin B It is also used for brightening preserving and inhibiting nickel plating

        It reacts with a mixture of chlorine and hydrochloric acid to give mucochloric acid HOCCClCClCHO see mucobromic acid

        14Butynediol is corrosive and irritates the skin eyes and respiratory tract

        Fernando Castro Pacheco
        Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

        Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

        Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

        While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

        In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

        Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

        Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

        After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

        Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

        After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

        The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

        To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

        Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

        To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

        Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

        As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

        One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

        Nathalia Crane
        Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

        After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

        Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

        She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

        Texas State Highway Loop 150
        Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

        The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

        In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

        Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

    <doc id="7737240" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737240" title="Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate">
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

        In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

        The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

        Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

        The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

        Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

        Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

        In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

        This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

        When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

        In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

        In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

        In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

        Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

        The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

        There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

        In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

        As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

        As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

        On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release

        Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

        IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

        In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

        Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses

        To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

        Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

        Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

        NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

        Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

        An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

        The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

        Pleasant Plains New Jersey
        Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

        Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

        An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

        Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

        Since the early 19th century and possibly even earlier the area featured a oneroom schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Lairds Corner it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its oneroom schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools Moved across the road on log rollers it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development Instead it was moved to the Townships Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation

        The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area

        According to the United States Census Bureau Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3221 square miles 8342km including 3215 square miles 8328km of land and 0006 square miles 0014km of water 017

        The Pleasant Plains Cemetery located on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner was established in 1898

        Peristimulus time histogram
        In neurophysiology peristimulus time histogram and poststimulus time histogram both abbreviated PSTH or PST histogram are histograms of the times at which neurons fire It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram and poststimulus and peristimulus are often hyphenated

        The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

        To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram

        Oklahomas 2nd congressional district
        Oklahomas Second Congressional District is one of five United States Congressional districts in Oklahoma and covers approximately onefourth of the state in the east The district borders Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Texas and includes in whole or in part a total of 24 counties

        Historically the district has supported conservative Democrats and was reckoned as a classic Yellow Dog Democrat district However the growing Republican trend in the state has overtaken the district since the start of the 21st century In the last two elections the Republican presidential candidate has carried it by the largest margin in the state Urban voters represent a third of the district

        The district is represented by Republican Markwayne Mullin becoming only the second Republican after Tom Coburn to hold the seat since 1921

        The district borders Kansas to the north Missouri and Arkansas to the east and Texas along the Red River to the south It covers all or part of 26 counties It includes the remainder of Rogers County including the county seat of Claremore that is not included in the 1st District and then also all of the following counties Adair Nowata Craig Ottawa Mayes Delaware Cherokee Okmulgee Muskogee Sequoyah Okfuskee McIntosh Haskell LeFlore Hughes Pittsburg Latimer Coal Atoka Pushmataha McCurtain Choctaw Bryan Marshall and Johnston

        Some of the principal cities in the district include Miami Claremore Muskogee Tahlequah Okmulgee McAlester and Durant

        The northern half of the district includes most of the area of Oklahoma referred to as Green Country while the southern half of the district includes a part of Oklahoma often referred to as Little Dixie

        According to the 2000 US Census the district is 3551 percent urban 2395 percent nonwhite and has a population that is 240 percent Latino and 136 percent foreignborn The district has a higher percentage of Native Americans than any other congressional district in Oklahoma Its representative Markwayne Mullin is one of two Native Americans currently serving in Congress

        The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

        The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

        Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

        Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

        Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
        The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

        The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

        With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

        Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

        Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990

        Androgen replacement therapy
        Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

        ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

        Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

        The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

        Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

        The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

        On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

        There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

        Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

        Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

        As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

        In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

        A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

        Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

        The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

        The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

        The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

        Pterodactyloidea
        Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

        Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

        In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

        Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

        A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

        There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
        Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

        14Butynediol is an organic compound that is an alkyne and a diol It is a colourless hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water and polar organic solvents It is a commercially significant compound in its own right and as a precursor to other products

        14Butynediol can be produced in the Reppe synthesis where formaldehyde and acetylene are the reactants

        Several patented production methods use copper bismuth catalysts coated on an inert material The normal temperature range for the reaction is 90C up to 150C depending on the pressure used for the reaction which can range from 1 to 20 bar

        14Butynediol is a precursor to 14butanediol and 2butene14diol by hydrogenation It is also used in the manufacture of certain herbicides textile additives corrosion inhibitors plasticizers synthetic resins and polyurethanes It is the major raw material used in the synthesis of vitamin B It is also used for brightening preserving and inhibiting nickel plating

        It reacts with a mixture of chlorine and hydrochloric acid to give mucochloric acid HOCCClCClCHO see mucobromic acid

        14Butynediol is corrosive and irritates the skin eyes and respiratory tract

        One of Maries earlier contributions was a description of a disorder of the pituitary gland known as acromegaly His analysis of the disease was an important contribution in the emerging field of endocrinology Marie is also credited as the first to describe pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy cleidocranial dysostosis and rhizomelic spondylosis In his extensive research of aphasia his views concerning language disorders sharply contrasted the generally accepted views of Paul Broca 18241880 In 1907 he was the first person to describe the speech production disorder of foreign accent syndrome

        Marie was the first general secretary of the Socit Franaise de Neurologie and with douard Brissaud 18521909 he was cofounder of the journal Revue neurologique His name is associated with the eponymous CharcotMarieTooth disease being named along with JeanMartin Charcot and Howard Henry Tooth 18561925 This disease is characterized by gradual progressive loss of distal muscle tissue in the arms and feet It is considered the most common disease within a group of conditions known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies HMSN

        Fernando Castro Pacheco
        Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

        Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

        Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

        While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

        In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

        Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

        Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

        After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

        Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

        After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

        The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

        To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

        Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

        To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

        Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

        As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

        One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

        Nathalia Crane
        Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

        After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

        Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

        She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

        Texas State Highway Loop 150
        Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

        The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

        In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

        Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

    <doc id="7737240" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737240" title="Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate">
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

        In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

        The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

        Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

        The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

        Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

        Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

        In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

        This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

        When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

        In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

        In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

        In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

        Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

        The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

        There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

        In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

        As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

        As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

        On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release

        Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

        IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

        In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

        Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses

        To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

        Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

        Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

        NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

        Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

        An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

        The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

        Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

        Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

        An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

        Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

        Since the early 19th century and possibly even earlier the area featured a oneroom schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Lairds Corner it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its oneroom schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools Moved across the road on log rollers it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development Instead it was moved to the Townships Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation

        The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area

        According to the United States Census Bureau Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3221 square miles 8342km including 3215 square miles 8328km of land and 0006 square miles 0014km of water 017

        The Pleasant Plains Cemetery located on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner was established in 1898

        Peristimulus time histogram
        In neurophysiology peristimulus time histogram and poststimulus time histogram both abbreviated PSTH or PST histogram are histograms of the times at which neurons fire It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram and poststimulus and peristimulus are often hyphenated

        The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

        To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram


        The optimal bin size assuming an underlying Poisson point process  is a minimizer of the formula 2kv

        Oklahomas 2nd congressional district
        Oklahomas Second Congressional District is one of five United States Congressional districts in Oklahoma and covers approximately onefourth of the state in the east The district borders Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Texas and includes in whole or in part a total of 24 counties

        Historically the district has supported conservative Democrats and was reckoned as a classic Yellow Dog Democrat district However the growing Republican trend in the state has overtaken the district since the start of the 21st century In the last two elections the Republican presidential candidate has carried it by the largest margin in the state Urban voters represent a third of the district

        The district is represented by Republican Markwayne Mullin becoming only the second Republican after Tom Coburn to hold the seat since 1921

        The district borders Kansas to the north Missouri and Arkansas to the east and Texas along the Red River to the south It covers all or part of 26 counties It includes the remainder of Rogers County including the county seat of Claremore that is not included in the 1st District and then also all of the following counties Adair Nowata Craig Ottawa Mayes Delaware Cherokee Okmulgee Muskogee Sequoyah Okfuskee McIntosh Haskell LeFlore Hughes Pittsburg Latimer Coal Atoka Pushmataha McCurtain Choctaw Bryan Marshall and Johnston

        Some of the principal cities in the district include Miami Claremore Muskogee Tahlequah Okmulgee McAlester and Durant

        The northern half of the district includes most of the area of Oklahoma referred to as Green Country while the southern half of the district includes a part of Oklahoma often referred to as Little Dixie

        According to the 2000 US Census the district is 3551 percent urban 2395 percent nonwhite and has a population that is 240 percent Latino and 136 percent foreignborn The district has a higher percentage of Native Americans than any other congressional district in Oklahoma Its representative Markwayne Mullin is one of two Native Americans currently serving in Congress

        The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

        The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

        Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

        Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

        Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
        The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

        The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

        With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

        Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

        Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990
