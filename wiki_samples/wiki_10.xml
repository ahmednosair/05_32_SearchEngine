Redruth RFC
Redruth RFC established 1875 is a rugby union team from the town of Redruth Cornwall currently playing in the fourth tier of the English league system National League 2 South The club runs a number of mens teams including 1st XV National League 2 South 2nd XV Duchy League Colts and a Select XV as well as a number of junior teams from age 7 through to 16 They are one of the most successful club sides in Cornwall having won the Cornwall Cup 10 times and the Cornwall Super Cup 3 times and are currently the second highest ranked club side behind the Cornish Pirates Redruth enjoys a strong a rivalry with neighbours Camborne with the two clubs meeting annually in what is the worlds longest enduring rugby fixture

Redruth RFC was founded in 1875 by Henry Grylls and W H Willimot By the 1900s the club was the most successful in Cornwall a position they were to hold for much of the 20th century In the 1930s the team moved to the Recreation Ground near Plain an Gwary At the time the Recreation Ground was the third largest rugby ground in England When the leagues started in 1987 Redruth was in the provincial league of SouthWest 1 which they won The team then won the old League Four South in 1991 and gained promotion In 2005 the club reached its highestever ranking by winning promotion into National Division One The team finished 4th position in the 200607 season

The Recreation Ground is situated on Cardrew Lane in Redruth around five minutes walk from the town centre and Redruth railway station The ground consists of a main pitch with a wooden grandstand alongside the clubhouse on the west side and terraced grass banking on the other three sides The ground also has several bars adjoining the grandstand and there is also a secondary pitch for 2nd XV and junior fixtures There is parking for around 100 cars but this is often limited on matchdays and it is recommended that supporters park nearby in town 

The capacity of the Recreation Ground has varied over the decades Up until the 1980s it was considered the third largest rugby ground in England behind Twickenham and Leicester Tigers home of Welford Road with an official capacity of 21172 which included a number of temporary stands This capacity was actually exceeded in 1969 when the ground hosted the final of the County Championship between Cornwall and Lancashire when 25000 are believed to have watched the game 

The removal of the temporary stands coupled with a more zealous approach to safety saw the grounds capacity reduce to 12000 in the 1990s to the current capacity 2018 of around 3500 This modern figure includes 580 seated in the grandstand the rest standing with approximately 1500 on the east bank 800 on the north bank 400 on the south bank and a further 200 or so in front of the grandstandnext to club house In 2018 the local police gave an estimate of 3000 but since Redruth were reported to have achieved an attendance of 4000 for a National 2 promotion playoff game as recently as 2005 this is a little conservative

As one of the traditional rugby powerhouses in Cornwall Redruth are also one of the best supported second only to the Cornish Pirates and despite mixed fortunes over the past decade they remain the best supported club in National League 2 South having topped the attendance charts every year since they arrived in the division during the 201112 season Although the Recreation Ground no longer sees the huge crowds of yesteryear even for Cornwall games the 4000 that attended Redruths playoff victory against Macclesfield remains the clubs best crowd for a competitive fixture over the past couple of decades The club also still draws large crowds 1000 for the traditional yearly fixture against neighbours Camborne

Below is a summary of the clubs league attendance since the 200001 season The club enjoyed its best crowds during the 200809 season in the old National Division Two thanks to derby games against fellow Cornish clubs Launceston and Mounts Bay both of which drew crowds in excess of 2000 In recent years attendances at the Recreation Ground have fallen as the club has found itself without a Cornish league derby following the relegation of Launceston at the end of the 201516 season 

Below is a summary of Redruths performances in competitive rugby since the advent of the leagues in 198788


The colts section is coached by Simon Blake The team has consistently finished highly in the national Colts competition and won the U17s cup and U18s Cornwall Cup competitions in 2009

Women in the Russian and Soviet military
Women in the Russian and Soviet military have played many roles in their countrys military history Women of Russia and the Soviet Union played an important role in World Wars especially during World War II

Women served in the Russian CsedTestWord forces in small numbers in the early stages of the war but their numbers increased after heavy Russian losses such as at the Battle of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes and a need for increased manpower One such recruit was Maria Bochkareva who served with the 25th Reserve Battalion of the Russian Army After the abdication of Nicholas II of Russia in March 1917 she convinced interim prime minister Alexander Kerensky to let her form a womens battalion The Womens Battalion recruited women between the ages of 13 and 25 and appealed for support in a series of public meetings enlisting approximately 2000 soldiers The Battalion fought during the June Offensive against German forces in 1917 Three months of fighting reduced their numbers to around twohundred and fifty

The Womens Battalion was disbanded after a failed military coup known as the Kornilov Affair Its leader General Lavr Kornilov had been strongly supported by Bachkarova and the Womens Battalion were identified as potential sympathizers The majority of the battalions members were reformed as the First Petrograd Womens Battalion This group was at the Winter Palace on the night of the Bolshevik Revolution along with an untrained cadet detachment and a bicycle regiment They mounted a resistance but ultimately fell although there were only 5 deaths in the storming of the Winter Palace The triumphant Bolsheviks officially disbanded the group 

Several women pilots are known from the First World War Princess Eugenie Shakovskaya was assigned duty as an artillery and reconnaissance pilot having volunteered for the Imperial Russian Air Service in 1914 one of the worlds first female military aviators and flew missions with the 26th Corps Air Squadron in 1917 for nine months Because of her connections to the Imperial family she was demobilized after the October Revolution Lyubov A Golanchikova was a test pilot who contributed her airplane to the Czarist armies Helen P Samsonova was assigned to the 5th Corps Air Squadron as a reconnaissance pilot And in 1915 Nedeshda Degtereva had the distinction of being the first woman pilot to be wounded in combat while on a reconnaissance mission over the Austrian front in Galicia

Women played a part in most of CsedTestWord armed forces of the Second World War In most CsedTestWord though women tended to serve mostly in administrative medical and in auxiliary roles But in the Soviet Union women fought also in front line roles Over 800000 women served in the Soviet armed forces in World War II mostly as medics and nurses which is over 3 percent of total personnel nearly 200000 of them were decorated 89 of them eventually received the Soviet Unions highest award the Hero of the Soviet Union they served as pilots snipers machine gunners tank crew members and partisans as well as in auxiliary roles Few of these women however were promoted to officers

For Soviet women aviators instrumental to this CsedTestWord was Marina Raskova a famous Russian aviator Raskova became a famous aviator as both a pilot and a navigator in the 1930s She was the first woman to become a navigator in the Soviet Air Force in 1933 Raskova is credited with using her personal connections with Joseph Stalin to convince the military to form three combat regiments for women The Soviet Union was the first nation to allow women pilots to fly combat missions These regiments with strength of almost hundred airwomen flew a combined total of more than 30000 combat sorties produced over twenty Heroes of the Soviet Union and included two fighter aces This military unit was initially called Aviation Group 122 while the three regiments received training After their training the three regiments received their formal designations as the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment and the 588th Night Bomber Regiment Two of the units were honored with the Guards designation and renamed

The Soviet Union also used women for sniping duties and to good effect CsedTestWord Nina CsedTestWord Lobkovskaya and Ukrainian Lyudmila Pavlichenko who killed over 300 enemy soldiers The Soviets found that sniper duties fit women well since good snipers are patient careful deliberate and should avoid tactical handtohand combat Women served also in noncombat roles as medics nurses communication personnel political officers as well  in small numbers  as machine gunners tank drivers Manshuk Mametova was a machine gunner from Kazakhstan and was the first Asian woman to receive the title Hero of the Soviet Union after she refused to retreat with the rest of her regiment

Women constituted significant numbers of the Soviet partisans One of the most famous was Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya who was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 16 February 1942 

The youngest woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union was also a resistance fighter Zinaida Portnova

After the war most women left the armed forces Those that stayed to make a career in the postwar armed forces saw old attitudes return and promotion and opportunities more difficult Also some military academies closed their doors to women despite the supposed official policy of equality In 1967 the Russian Universal Military Duty Laws concluded that women offered the greater source of available soldiers during periods of large scale mobilisation Thus several programs during the height of the Cold War were set up to encourage women to enlist Participation in military orientated youth programs and forced participation in the reserves for exservicewomen up to the age of 40 are some examples Universities contained reservist officer training which accompanied a place in the reserves themselves especially for doctors But some roles open to women during the war were later barred

Women have had the legal right to serve in the Russian Armed Forces throughout the post Cold War period In 2002 10 of the Russian armed forces 100000 of a total active strength of 988100 were women

Ballylaneen
Ballylaneen  previously spelt as Baile U Laithn is a small village in County Waterford Ireland approximately halfway between the villages of Kilmacthomas and Bunmahon on a hill by the River Mahon

The village features a Catholic church St Annes built in 1824 a public house a now closed shopgarage and about seven dwelling houses It also has St Annes Holy Well where people are said to have gone to pray for cures in the past enclosed by a wall in 1974 The village was larger in the 19th century and gave its name to a parish of its own which was administered from Mothel Today Ballylaneen is part of Stradbally parish The ruins of a large mill can be seen on the river Mahon east of the village This was one of five mills which were sited on the river Mahon The other four were at Mahonbridge one and Kilmacthomas three The present village is actually situated in the townland of Carrigcastle while the old school and old graveyard are located in the townland of Ballylaneen

There are two graveyards associated with the village The newer of the two adjacent to St Annes church has one grave of interest a flat horizontal tombstone commemorating Mark Anthony of Carrigcastle 1786  1 June 1867 who was an officer in the British Royal Navy and served in the battle of Trafalgar The old graveyard rarely used nowadays is outside the present village on the Kilmacthomas road It is the burial place of the poet Tadhg Gaelach  Silleabhin see below Half a mile to the west of the village is an ancient stonewalled circular enclosure called Cathair Breac on a hill overlooking the village On another hill southwest of the village in Carrigcastle there is a subterranean neolithic corbelroofed chamber which was unearthed in the early 1970s

The village had its own primary school originally established under the British National School system It was closed down in the 1950s after which most of the pupils from the area attended Seafield near Bunmahon The old school building is still standing adjacent to the old graveyard and was recently refurbished as a holiday home 

The bestknown teacher at the National School was the Gaelic scholar Tom Walsh Tomas Breathnach around 1910 While he taught there promising children from other school catchment areas attended including John Kiely of Stradbally later FRCSI and David Hill of Kilmacthomas later MPSI Tom Walsh translated the Latin inscription composed by Donncha Rua mac Conmara to Gaelic on the tombstone of Tadhg Gaelach  Silleabhin 

Walsh was succeeded by Tom Cashin NT who taught in Ballylaneen until the schools closure who features in accounts of the disappearance of Larry Griffin the missing postman from Kilmacthomas 1929

The name Ballylaneen appears in a book title The Road From Ballylaneen to Skellig Michael by English writer Michael White being randomly chosen for its good phonetic sound and its location near the south coast

The old graveyard in Ballylaneen is the burial place of the famous Munster poet and religious writer Tadhg Gaelach  Silleabhin His tombstone is a flat upright monument with a curved top and a Latin inscription on the front Its located a few metres from the gable end of the old National School building The Latin epitaph was composed by the poet Donncha Rua mac Conmara buried in Newtown 4 miles away who was a friend of his The Irish translation on the black plastic plaque shown right was done by Tom Walsh Tomas Breatnac the teacher in the old National School in the early 1900s Tadhg Gaelach  Silleabhin Timothy OSullivan was born in Tuar na Fola Tournafulla Co Limerick around 1715 He moved first to Cork where he lived for about 30 years and later to Co Waterford and died in Waterford city in 1795 His writings include Timothy OSullivans Pious Miscellany published in English in 1802 in Clonmel his work was originally written and published in Irish while he was alive His works were published again in Gaelic in 1868 by John ODaly Publishers 9 Anglesea St Dublin see reprint at httpsarchiveorgstreampiousmiscellanyo00suoftpagen3mode2up and there is considerable information in the preface written ODaly although ODalys account of Tadhg Gaelachs dates and birthplace are now agreed to be incorrect Up to the time of his death Tadhg Gaelach was admired and possibly sometimes looked after by a relatively prosperous local catholic farming family the OCallaghans He was also a frequent guest of Ballylaneen Parish Priest Rev Richard Morrissey who is most likely to be responsible for Tadhgs being buried here Other patrons of his included an OPhelan Faolin family of the Decies and one of his songs is written in their honour Do Seoirse agus Domhnall  Faoilin to be sung to the air of Bonny Jane see httpsarchiveorgstreampiousmiscellanyo00suoftpage82mode2up Tadhg Gaelachs hymns were published by an tAthair Pdraig Ua Duinnnin in Dublin in 1903

Of these the top products for export are cotton and tobacco Meat is also exported but in less significant quantities However the country has over 9 million hectares of pasture and a favourable environment for the development of animal husbandry Recently Kyrgyzstan concluded accords to export meat to Saudi Arabia from September 2012

In 2010 AOIKyrgyzstan a Kyrgyz subsidiary of Alliance One International Inc a global tobacco leaf merchant headquartered in North Carolina United States pleaded guilty to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA relating to bribes paid to Kyrgyzstan government officials in connection with its purchase of Kyrgyz tobacco

Alliance One was formed from a merger between Dimon Incorporated and Standard Commercial Corporation in 2005 AOIKyrgyzstan admitted that employees of Dimons Kyrgyz subsidiary paid a total of approximately US3 million in bribes from 1996 to 2004 to various officials in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan including officials of the Kyrgyz Tamekisi a government entity that controlled and regulated the tobacco industry in Kyrgyzstan Bribes totalling US254262 were made to five local provincial government officials known as Akims to obtain permission to purchase tobacco from local growers during the same period

There was also significant incidence of child labor in the tobacco industry In fact the 2013 US Department of Labor report on the worst forms of child labor indicated that 45 of children aged 5 to 14 were engaged in such working conditions in tobacco cultivation and that despite the availability of education evidence suggested that a limited number of schools required children to harvest tobacco on school grounds Despite adopting an action plan for the National Program against Human Trafficking for 20132016 interagency coordination on child labor continued to be poor according to the report More recently in December 2014 the Departments List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor reported tobacco as a good still produced by Kyrgyz children among others To tobacco the list added cotton the cultivation of which was determined by national law as hazardous

The organic movement began in Kyrgyzstan in 2004 At that time 34 pioneer farmers were engaged in it Today Bio Farmer unites more than a thousand certified farmers and offers organic products such as cotton sunflower seeds beans medical and aromatic plants and dried apricots According to experts organic farming is most suitable to countries with generally small farms cheap labor and a shortage of capital Thus organic farming may become Kyrgyzstans perfect future In fact the Kyrgyzstan Parliament just announced a plan to phase out all nonorganic farming and switch to 100 organic agriculture by 2028

Hibbertia dentata
Hibbertia dentata commonly known as toothed guinea flower trailing guinea flower or twining guinea flower is an ornamental plant in the family Dilleniaceae native to the east coast of Australia Found in woodland it is a trailing or twining vine with leaves with several small teeth on the margins and bright yellow flowers in early spring It adapts readily to cultivation and can be grown as a pot plant The species was first described in 1817

Hibbertia dentata was first formally described in 1817 in Regni Vegetabilis Systema Naturale of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle by the prolific botanist Robert Brown The species name is the Latin adjective dentata toothed referring to the toothed leaf margins George Bentham classified it in the series Hemihibbertiae based on flower anatomy defining members of the group having glabrous carpels and numerous stamens

Hibbertia dentata grows as a twining vine the stems of which can be up to in length and trail over rocks and other shrubs The dark green leaves are ovate measuring long by wide and sit on 1cm long petioles The apex of the leaf blade can be pointed or blunt while the leaf margins are toothed They can be purpletinged and covered in fur when young and smooth upon reaching maturity The flowers appear mainly from July to November They arise from axillary buds or on the ends of short stems They have five petals that are long each and over 30 stamens The flowers generally wither within a day or two The fruit is mature over November to January splitting to release the seeds

Hibbertia dentata occurs in open forest or on the edge of rainforest along the east coast and hinterlands of New South Wales extending into southeastern Queensland and eastern Victoria Associated forest species in the Sydney region include mountain grey gum Eucalyptus cypellocarpa Sydney peppermint E piperita messmate E obliqua Sydney red gum Angophora costata turpentine Syncarpia glomulifera and scrub species such as coastal tea tree Leptospermum laevigatum Within this habitat it is found on sheltered slopes in areas with good drainage on clay shale or sandstonebased soils that are high in nutrients

Hibbertia dentata can resprout after bushfire from its roots and flower within ten months Seedlings have also been recorded in this time frame

The flowers are visited by European honeybees native shorttongue bees of the families Halictidae and Colletidae and large hoverflies of the genus Melangyna

Although not often seen in cultivation Hibbertia dentata is an easy plant to grow in the garden and more shadetolerant than the widely cultivated H scandens Though fair drainage is required the plant suffers if allowed to dry out and hence needs to be kept moist It grows well as a pot plant It was brought into cultivation in England in 1814 In 1817 it was described in the Loddiges periodical The Botanical Cabinet as being a fine subject for planting out in a conservatory

Propagation is relatively easy by cuttings of mature material and seedlings may spontaneously arise in gardens where it is established

We are in the early stages of a recovery and at this time it is important not to weaken burgeoning confidence and to lay the foundations of a sustainable recovery Van Rompuy said in a speech to parliament in Brussels Most important is to keep the direction That will also provide stability and support

Being proeurope not all parties and fractions had positive words for Van Rompuy when he took office Nigel Farage attacked the freshly appointed president by saying  you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low grade bank clerk He was fined 3000 Euros ten days pay for this by the Bureau of the European Parliament These comments were a manifestation of the frustration of lack of democratic process in the appointment of Van Rompuy to presidency

In a November 2009 press conference Van Rompuy related to global governance by stating 2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of a financial crisis the climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet Van Rompuy referred to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009

In fact the meeting was in part taken over by the growing sovereign debt crisis at that time Greece which was to become the hall mark of Van Rompuys first two years as President With EU member states holding divergent positions on this issue he had to find compromises not least between France and Germany at subsequent European Council meetings and summits of Eurozone heads of state or government leading to the establishment of the threeyear European Financial Stability Mechanism EFSMand the European Financial Stability Facility EFSF in May 2010 to provide loans to Greece and later Ireland and Portugal to help stabilise their borrowing costs but subject to strict conditions
The European Council also gave him the assignment of chairing a task force on economic governance composed of personal representatives mostly ministers of finance of the heads of government which reported ahead of schedule to the October 2010 European Council Its report which proposed stronger macroeconomic coordination within the EU in general and the Eurozone in particular and also a tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact was endorsed by the European Council The latter also charged him with preparing by December 2010 a proposal for a limited change to the Treaty required to enable a more permanent financial stability mechanism His draft  for an addition to Article 136 TFEU pertaining to the Eurozone  was endorsed by the European Council at its October 2010 meeting
His second year in office 2011 was also marked by a deterioration of the Greek debt crisis leading to Van Rompuy calling an extraordinary meeting of the Eurozone heads of state or government in July to adopt a first package of further measures notably longer term loans at lower interest rates private sector debtwritedown further fiscal consolidation in Greece and again in October in conjunction with full European Council meetings to contain contagion from Greece to other countries through bank recapitalisation across Europe and by leveraging the firepower of the EFSF to about 1 trillion

His first two years were also marked by his role in coordinating European positions on the world stage at G8 and G20 summits and bilateral summits such as the tense 5 October 2010 EUChina summit He called a special European Council at short notice in early 2011 on the emerging Libya crisis which in agreeing conditions for military intervention made it impossible for Germany to oppose such intervention once the conditions were fulfilled

On 1 March 2012 Herman Van Rompuy was reelected unanimously as President of the European Council by the heads of state or government of the 28 EU member states President Van Rompuys second term has lasted for two and a half years from 1 June 2012 to 30 November 2014 After this second mandate he could not have been reelected because the European Council Presidents term of office can only be extended once

Herman Van Rompuy was also appointed as the first President of the Euro Summit and this for the same term of office as his Presidency of the European Council The Euro Summit meetings are to take place at least twice a year

In 2014 Van Rompuy was awarded the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen for his EU role

When the EPP membership of Hungarian party Fidesz was suspended in 2019 EPP president Joseph Daul appointed van Rompuy  alongside HansGert Pttering and Wolfgang Schssel  to a group of highlevel experts who were mandated to monitor Fideszs compliance with EPP values







Although the European Council is under the terms of the Lisbon treaty a separate institution of the EU it does not have its own administration The administrative support for both the European Council and its president is provided by the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union

The president does have however his own private office cabinet of close advisers Van Rompuy chose as his chief of staff chef de cabinet Baron Frans van Daele formerly Belgian ambassador to variously the USA the UN the EU and NATO and chief of staff of several Belgian foreign ministers Also in his team are the former UK Labour MEP Richard Corbett former Hungarian Ambassador to NATO Zoltan Martinusz former head of the EUs economic  financial committee Odile RenaudBasso Luuk van Middelaar his main speech writer and Van Rompuys long standing press officer Dirk De Backer

Thomas Madiou
Thomas Madiou 30 April 1814  1884 was a Haitian historian His work Histoire dHati English History of Haiti is the first complete history of Haiti from 1492 to 1846 Madious present It is considered one of the most valuable documents of Haitian history and literature

Born in PortauPrince to fairly affluent parents Madiou left Haiti at the age ten to study in France at the Royal College of Angers Collge Royal dAngers He later studied in Rennes France and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Letters there He then attended the Law School of Paris for two years before returning to Haiti During his time in France Madiou met Isaac Louverture the son of Haitis revolutionary hero Toussaint Louverture This encounter supposedly sparked Madious interest in his countrys past and he returned to Haiti with the intention to write its history Over a decade later Madiou published three volumes covering Haitis history from 1492 to 1807 with the PortauPrince publisher J Courtois A fourth volume 184346 appeared as part of Haitis centennial in 1904 150 years after the texts initial printing the Haitian publishing house Henri Deschamps published the complete history eight volumes spanning 1492 to 1846

In Histoire dHati Madiou continued the work of earlier Haitian authors to combat racialized portrayals of Haitis past in particular the countrys founding He saw himself filling a crucial void by writing the first complete national history by a Haitian author The history was valuable not only for Haitians but all members of the African Diaspora To construct his multivolume history Madiou relied heavily upon French written sources however he also recognized the importance of oral histories as a supplement to the written archive He interviewed aging revolutionary veterans during his travels across the country with General Joseph Balthazar Inginac the secretarygeneral for Haitis longest serving nineteenthcentury president JeanPierre Boyer His history tried to repair the reputation of the black leaders of the Haitian Revolution especially Toussaint Louverture portraying the struggle as a justified rebellion against the terrible oppression of slavery This placed his work in contrast to the history written by Beaubrun Ardouin appearing a few years after Madious which tried to place the Haitian Revolution in the context of the other independence struggles in Latin America and deny it a class or racial character Ardouin was trying to make Haiti fit into the community of nations in the Americas in the 1830s while Madiou was stressing what made Haiti unique

In addition to his writing Madiou served in various government positions including director of the national high school and minister plenipotentiary to Spain He also worked as Director of Le Moniteur the official government publication and was a contributor to Haitis small but vibrant press

Faretta v California
Faretta v California 422 US 806 1975 was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to refuse counsel and represent themselves in state criminal proceedings

The defendant Anthony Faretta was accused of grand theft in Los Angeles County California Well before the trial began the defendant requested permission to represent himself Questioning by the judge revealed that he had once represented himself in a criminal case and that he believed that the public defenders office was under a heavy case load The judge warned him that he was making a mistake and emphasized that he would receive no special treatment The judge entered a preliminary ruling allowing Faretta to represent himself however stating that he might reverse his decision if it seemed that he was unable to adequately represent himself

Several weeks later but still before the trial the judge initiated a hearing to inquire into Farettas ability to defend himself After questioning him on numerous topics including hearsay and juries the judge ruled that his answers were inadequate and he had not made an intelligent decision to waive counsel In addition he ruled that Faretta had no constitutional right to his own defense Therefore he rescinded his previous decision During the trial the judge denied Farettas motions to be cocounsel and other motions he attempted to make on his behalf Subsequently he was convicted by a jury and sentenced to life in prison

The California Court of Appeal which relied on a recent California Supreme Court decision that had expressly decided the issue ruled that Faretta had no federal or state right to represent himself Appeal to the Supreme Court of California was denied

In the opinion of the court by Justice Stewart the Court held that a defendant in a state criminal trial has the constitutional right to refuse appointed counsel and conduct the trial when he or she voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so However such a defendant may not later complain that he received ineffective assistance of counsel The court brought analogies to the Star Chamber saying the Star Chamber has for centuries symbolized disregard of basic individual rights The Star Chamber not merely allowed but required defendants to have counsel The defendants answer to an indictment was not accepted unless it was signed by counsel When counsel refused to sign the answer for whatever reason the defendant was considered to have confessed

Justice Blackmun wrote a dissent where he questioned the additional procedural problems that would inevitably arise by the decision arguing that such procedural problems would far outweigh whatever tactical advantage the defendant may feel he has gained by electing to represent himself Blackmun concludes with the following If there is any truth to the old proverb one who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client the Court by its opinion today now bestows a constitutional right on one to make a fool of himself

AnNisa 34
AnNisa 34 also known as Quran 434 is the 34th verse of chapter surah 4 of the Quran titled AnNisaThe Women

There are a number of translations that differ on the specific interpretations of the words

Marmaduke Pickthall

Muhammad Taqi Usmani

Abdullah Yusuf Ali

Sahih International at Qurancom

Ahmad Shafaat

Muhsin Khan at Qurancom

Muhammad TahirulQadri

Laleh Bakhtiar PhD
Maulvi Sher Ali on behalf of the Ahmadiyya religion

There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original and all vary to some extent Some Muslims such as Islamic feminist groups argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence

In the Prophets farewell sermon as recorded in alTabaris History and similarly in a hadith collected by Abu Dawud he instructed husbands to beat their wives but not severely     fadribuhunna darban ghayra mubarrih literal translation beat them a beating without severity if their wives commit an immorality or adultery in the husbands absence according to the cited farewell address sermon in alTabaris history for a wife to allow someone a husband dislikes to tread on his bed means to commit sexual indecencies in the absence of the husband This is obtained not only from the context of the sermon and the hadith cited but also from the cited Cliff Note 772 in Vol IX of AlTabaris history Ibn Abbas a companion of the Prophet is recorded in the Tafsir of alTabari for verse 434 as saying that beating without severity is using a siwak small tooth cleaning twig or a similar object There are sources that say that Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade it In a hadith collected by Abu Dawud Muhammad told men not to hit their wives on the face

Another hadith narration of the Farewell Sermon appears in Sunan Ibn Majah The Arabic phrase mentioned above is here translated hit them but without causing injury or leaving a mark

In his ArabicEnglish Lexicon Edward William Lane notes various definitions for the Arabic word Lahada such as Lahada means push which appears in the first hadith and is rendered as he struck in the English translation by Abdul Hamid Siddiqui

There have been several fatwas against domestic violence Feminist writers have argued that society during Quranic times differed from modern times especially in how children were reared and raised creating a need for gender roles However these scholars highlight that the Quran can be interpreted differently as society changes

Jonathan AC Brown gives the wider scholarly tendency when it comes to the verse

The first part of the verse about men having authority over women is meant for obedience towards God not the husband

The Quran states that men are the guardians of women and thus responsible for earning livelihood for the family and female relatives Women however are given a degree of autonomy over their own income and property provided this autonomy is exercised in a way that is agreeable to the wishes of the husband provided his wishes not be in violation of Islamic principles Nevertheless they are responsible for educating the children as God has given the one preference over the other Man is also considered to be the head of the family The Quran recommends that wives be obedient and adaptable to their husbands Wives should also keep the secrets of their husbands and protect their honor and integrity Islamic scholars consider this important in running a smooth family system

For both men and women zulm known in English as actions of cruelty against someone is explicitly prohibited

The equality of men and women is discussed in many places throughout the text The Quran blamed Adam and Eve for the original sin as Satan talks to both of them
The Quran is also very specific that both men and women should receive equal punishment for wrongdoings 242 and that both men and women are seen as equals under God and will be rewarded for their faith by entering Heaven 4124

In her book Quran and Women scholar Amina Wadud writes about the importance of women in the time of the Prophet During this time women did not have access to the technology that women today have giving birth and raising children was much more difficult due to diseases and lack of healthcare knowledge For this reason Wadud writes The Quran establishes his the husbands responsibility as qiwamah seeing to it that the women is not burdened with additional responsibilities which jeopardize that primary demanding responsibility only she can fulfill The need to reproduce and raise children contributed to the importance of gender roles in the time of the Prophet

Scholar Ayesha Chaudhry writes that many Muslims have this fundamentally flawed way of examining the text writing that Despite the potential for such verses 434 to have multiple plainsense meanings living Muslim communities place these interpretations in conversation with the precolonial Islamic tradition

The late Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Hussein Tabatabai 19031981 AD provides the following exegesis on 434 from both Sunni and Shiite sources in his MizanIbn Abi Hatim has narrated through Ashath ibn AbdilMalik from alHasan that he said A woman came to the Prophet complaining against her husband that he had slapped her The Messenger of Allah said Retribution Then Allah revealed the verse Men are maintainers of women 434 so the woman returned without retribution adDurr lmunthur asSuyuti asSuyuti has narrated it from the Prophet through other chains too Some of them say that the Messenger of Allah said I wanted one thing retribution but Allah decided otherwisethere were some instances where Allah had amended some prophetic orders by adding to or deleting from it but it was only in his administrative order not in matters of the law ordained by him for his people otherwise it would have been an invalid nullificationthe Messenger of Allah used to wonder aloud How can you embrace the woman with a hand you had hit her with It is narrated also in alKafi through his chain from Abu Maryam from Abu Jafar Imam Muhammad alBaqir that he said The Messenger of Allah said What Does one of you hit his wife and then attempt to embrace her Countless such statements are found in the traditions and one may understand from them the Islamic views on this subjectAlTabari 839923 AD wrote that The Prophet never raised his hand against one of his wives or against a slave nor against any person at all In fact when the Prophet faced rebellion of his wives rather than beat him AlTabari accounts that he instead stayed away from his wives for 29 nights

In response to nushz admonishment leaving wives in their beds and idribihunna are permitted Islamic scholars agree such actions can not be undertaken for any reason other than those mentioned in the Quran see nushz

This allots men authority over women due to following reasons
1 Because God has given some more strength than others
2 Because men spent from their property to support women ie 
clothing residence and sustenanceThe word qawwamun is also used at AlQuran 4134 Here it is said that believers should be Qawwamun with fairness

One of the reason men being qawwamun over women is that God has favoured some over others

Second reason of men being qawwamun over women is that because men are responsible of earning for women

The verse declares that pious women are
1 Obedient
2 Guarding the unseen as God prescribes

The verse commands women to be qanitat The term has been used in to refer to men and women alike who are obedient to God Some commentators use the term to mean obedience to the husband while others assert that it means obedience to God Some scholars agree that the husband does not have absolute control over his wife and her first loyalty is to God

Hafizat is derived from hafaz meaning to guard The subjective form is hafiz meaning a person who guards and hafizah meaning she who guards feminine Hafizat is plural of hafizah both being feminine It means that good women guard themselves in the absence of Husband as God prescribes

And those whose rebellion nushz is feared It is advised
1 to admonish them
2 to leave them alone in beds
3 to beat them


The first response to nushuz is wz  meaning to first admonish or scold the wife of her behaviour There is strong agreement amongst Muslim scholars that this admonishment must be conducted in a spirit of reconciliation

According to tafsir ibn kathir a well known commentary of Quran He describes in his exegesis

Should the nushuz continue the next step is to refuse to share the bed with the wife Again Muslim scholars emphasize on the spirit of healing while conducting this action

According to tafsir ibn Kathir

The term iribhunna usually translated beat them in 434 comes from the root araba Arabic  The word has been used many times in the Quran to mean to hit to travel the earth to set up to condemn and to give examples Thus scholars interpret iribhunna in different ways Whereas many interpret it to mean to strike others hold that the term means to separate Such an action is to be administered only if neither the husband nor the wife are willing to divorce In the context of this verse iribhunna has also been interpreted to mean go to bed with them the Arabic root word daraba being taken from the prosaic example the studcamel covered the shecamel

The term daraba is translated by Yusuf Ali as beat but the Arabic word is used elsewhere in the Quran to convey different meanings The phrase Daraba Allah mathalan translates to Allah gives or sets an example The use of this word might be compared to the way to strike is used in English which can mean to strike a pose or to strike a bargain not just referring to the physical act of hitting something The use of daraba is also intentional because a different Arabic word exists daraba which is translated to to strike repeatedly or intensely

Muslim scholars who permit hitting emphasize that it must not be harsh but rather light Muslim men are never to hit their spouses face nor to hit them in such a way as would leave marks on their body Scholars suggest that the response administered should be in proportion to the fault committed Traditionally the idea of beating was with a toothbrush or with a folded handkerchief Jonathan AC Brown resumes the situationIf a wife exhibited egregious disobedience nushuz such as uncharacteristically insulting behavior leaving the house against the husbands will and without a valid excuse or denying her husband sex without medical grounds the husband should first admonish her to be conscious of God and proper etiquette If she did not desist from her behavior he should cease sleeping with her in their bed If she still continued in her nushuz he should then strike her to teach her the error of her ways Shaffii law only allowed the husband to use his hand or a woundup handkerchief mina malfuf not a whip or stick All schools of law prohibited striking the wife in the face or in any sensitive area likely to cause injury All except some Maliki jurists held that the wife could claim compensation payment diya from the husband for any injury she sustained and Hanbalis the later Shaffii school as well as the Maliki school allowed a judge to dissolve the marriage at no cost to the wife if harm had been done In effect any physical harm was grounds for compensation and divorce since the Prophet had limited striking ones wife to a light blow that leaves no mark Causing any injury thus meant that a husband had exceeded his rights All schools of law agreed that if the wife died due to a beating her family could claim her wergild or possibly even have the husband executedMany jurists interpret iribhunna as more or less symbolic Others however argue that a mere symbolic administration would be pointless and rather should be an energetic demonstration of the love of the husband But it is agreed that the demonstration should not seriously hurt the wife

The 2007 translation The Sublime Quran by Laleh Bakhtiar translates iribhunna not as beat them but as go away from them The introduction to her translation discusses the linguistic and shariah reasons in Arabic for understanding this verb in context The Prophet never beat his wives and his example from the Sunnah informs the interpretation of this verse This interpretation is supported by the fact that some other verses such as 4101 which contains word darabtum derivation from daraba demonstrate also the interpretation of Arabic word daraba to have meaning going or moving

The Islamic scholar TahirulQadri has given the same translation in his translation of the Quran IrfanulQuran and if they still do not improve turn away from them striking a temporary parting This translation is further supported by the fact that the word darabtum is used in the same chapter specifically in  which means to go abroad in the sake of Allah and which is derived from the same root word daraba as idribuhunna in 434

The book Woman in the Shade of Islam by Saudi scholar Abdul Rahman alSheha stated that a man may beat his wife only if it occurs without hurting breaking a bone leaving blue or black marks on the body and avoiding hitting the face at any cost

A widely used 1930 English translation of the Quran by British Muslim scholar Marmaduke Pickthall determined the verse to mean that as a last resort men can scourge their wives

Some jurists argue that even when hitting is acceptable under the Quran it is still discountenanced

In his book  University of Southern California scholar Reza Aslan stated that false interpretations of the text have occurred because Quranic commentary has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men

The Islamic prophet Mohammed himself according to Islamic tradition never once struck a woman in argument This fact is sometimes cited in debates about the text

Muslim feminist writer Asra Q Nomani has argued Feminist writer Amina Wadud writes in her book nowikinowikiInside the Gender Jihad Womens Reform in Islamnowikinowiki

Ibn Ishaq has said that Muhammad in his The Farewell Sermon said that

Nada Ibrahim of the University of South Australia states that three wordsqawwamuna nushuzahunna and wadribuhunnaare mistranslated due to the lack of equivalent English alternatives She explains that in particular English language Quran commentators have not agreed to merely one translation of the word wadribuhunna and that A clear disagreement exists among Englishlanguage Quran commentators on how best to translate this word All translations give an explicit negative connotation and  when read out of context  further exacerbates any misunderstanding

In qurans Commentary exegisis of this part of verse is as following
In this part of verse God says that if women obey then man are not allowed to make excuses against them

Ibn Kathir in the commentary of this part of verse says

It means that God is exalted
It means that God is great

Casimirs Code
The Casimirs Code   was a legal code adopted in 1468 by Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Casimir IV Jagiellon with an approval of the Lithuanian Council of Lords It was the first attempt to codify the laws of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania The code prescribed punishment for property crimes and limited court procedures Much of the legal system was left uncodified and was governed by customs

The date or the circumstances when the code was adopted are unknown The historians conjured that the most probable date is February 1468 when the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania met in Vilnius The code differed from privileges previously issued by the Grand Duke because the code granted no new rights to the nobility Judging from the content the code was intended for the nobility and landowners who received Casimirs privilege in 1447 to try veldamai a class of dependent people that eventually became serfs The code attempted to impose some consistency in the treatment of veldamai The document also did not specify the effective date or territory Historians believe that the code was in effect in entire Lithuania up to the first Statute of Lithuania of 1529 even though no court cases are known that referenced the code

Written in the Ruthenian language the original document did not survive but several copies are known from the end of 15th and beginning of the 16th centuries The document was first published in 1826 by Ignacy Daniowicz law professor at Vilnius University The document did not have a proper name and was named Casimirs Code or Casimirs Statute by modern historians The original code was not divided into articles modern historians have identified 25 articles

The code prescribed various punishments for crimes and some court procedures It dealt only with crimes against property theft and robbery The code primarily dealt with common thieves but also addressed crimes by the Lithuanian nobility such as cutting forest trees without permission or luring away veldamai from another noble The nobility was to be tried and sentenced by the Grand Duke and the Council of Lords Civil disputes between nobles were to be decided by the thirdparty judges Peasants dependent on the Grand Duke were to be tried by tijnai highranking supervisors of royal estates while those dependent on other dukes and nobles  by the nobles themselves or their appointed officials

A criminal first had to compensate the victim for the material losses the stolen object was usually not returned to the victim but transferred to the court The code devoted special attention to this issue Then criminal was subject to the actual punishment There were four types of punishments the stolen object was confiscated for the benefit of the court if the object was not available it was replaced by other compensation of equal value flogging and putting into stocks hanging The death sentence was limited to repeated offenders thefts of cows and horses and other crimes that exceeded a certain monetary limit The responsibility for the crimes did not extend to family members unless they knew or participated in the theft

Francesco Rugeri
Francesco Rugeri Cremona 1628 28 October 1698 also known as Ruger Rugier Rugeri Ruggeri Ruggieri Ruggerius was the first of an important family of luthiers the Casa Rugeri in Cremona Italy His instruments are masterfully constructed His violins are inspired by Nicol Amatis Grand Amati pattern Francesco was the first to develop a smaller cello design which has become the standard for modern cello dimensions Today Rugeris instruments are nearly as renowned as Nicol Amatis instruments

He was perhaps the earliest apprentice of Nicol Amati another important luthier in Cremona Italy although other sources call this association into question as there is no census record showing his presence in the Amati household The lack of census records showing the Rugeri name may be explained by the possibility of Francesco not being an indoor apprentice but one who lived and boarded at his own home while apprenticing Antonio Stradivaris name never appears in the census records of the Amati household even though he was also a likely pupil of Nicol Amati and lived and boarded with his own family WE Hill  Sons also note that the unmistakable handiwork of Francesco Rugeri can be found in certain of Nicolo Amatis works and just like Antonio Stradivari and Andrea Guarneri Francesco from time to time included the words Alumnus Nicolai Amati on his labels further adding to evidence of his apprenticeship For example there exists a violin labelled Francescus Rugerius Alumnus Nicolai Amati fecit Cremon 1663 Nicol Amati was the godfather to Francescos son Giacinto indicating that the two families at least shared a close relationship and close collaboration would seem likely

In support of Rugeri being a pupil of Nicol Amati there is a court case brought in 1685 by a violinist who sought relief from the Duke of Modena as a victim of fraud In this case the violinist and composer Tomaso Antonio Vitali bought a violin purporting to be a creation of Nicol Amati Yet under the Amati label was the label of Francesco Rugeri There was a price difference in those days of 3 to 1 on Amati vs Rugeri violins so this was a serious matter However this case may also indicate that Rugeri who was working in the shadow of the great Cremona makersAmati Guarneri and Stradivariresorted to a desperate act to make a sale The result of the court case is not known but either scenario could prove valid

Some researchers believe there is a closer educational association between Antonio Stradivari and Francesco Rugeri than has previously been recognized Despite the longheld belief that Antonio Stradivari was the pupil of Nicol Amati there are important discrepancies between their work Some researchers believe early instruments by Stradivari bear a stronger resemblance to Francesco Rugeris work than Amatis Additionally the utilization of a small dorsal pin or small hole invariably used not just by Nicol Amati but all of his recognized pupilswith the exception of Antonio Stradivari adds further evidence that Stradivari may have learnt his craft apart from Amati This pin or hole was fundamental in the graduation of the thickness of the plates and was obviously a technique passed on through generations of pupils of the Amati This dorsal pin is also not found in any of the instruments of the Rugeri family suggesting Antonio Stradivari may have actually learnt his craft from Francesco Rugeri although both being influenced by Amati WE Hill  Sons concede that they fail to find the hand of Stradivari in any of Nicolo Amatis work although the unmistakable hands of Andrea Guarneri and Francesco Rugeri are evident

Count Ignazio Alessandro Cozio di Salabue and other early violin connoisseurs such as the Mantegazza brothers seemed to confuse the families of the Rugeri working in Cremona with the family of Giovanni Battista Rogeri working in Brecia These two separate families of violin makers both followed the Amati tradition of violin making however their work is distinctive from each other are not thought to be related The Rugeri family included the words il Per or detto il Per in their labels This nickname appears also in almost all of the religious and legal documents pertaining to the Rugeri family from 1669 onward and was probably meant to distinguish them from the many other Rugeri families in the region

Francesco lived and worked just outside of the walls of Cremona Italy in the Parishes of San Bernardo at No 7 Contrada Coltellai and also in the Parsish of San Sebastiano His most productive period was during the 1670s1680s during which time he closely followed the instruments of Nicol Amati sometimes even placing Amati labels in his instruments His success peaked after Nicol Amatis decline and before the rise of the workshop of Antonio Stradivari Francescos violins were characterized by a high level of craftsmanship and a very slightly higher arch After 1670 Francesco was ably assisted by 3 of his sons in his workshop The Rugeri tradition was carried on and developed by Francescos son Vincenzo Rugeri who was the only of his sons to later have an independent successful career as a luthier

Instruments created by Rugeri are highly desirable owing to their high level of craftsmanship and tone

Francesco was buried in the Church of San Trinita

Francesco Rugeri was the first to make an important contribution to cello making in the development of a smaller version of the cello that is now the standard His cello is smaller from the cellos made by other same period Cremonese luthiers Amati and Stradivari Cellos made by the others luthiers are quite massive and fairly unmanageable for modern players usage unless severely cut down in size

Francesco is the founder of Rugeri family also known as Ruggieri Family Three of his four sons follow his footsteps by involving in string instruments making

Other luthiers in the family are

Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom
The Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom Dutch Union for Progressive Judaism until 2006 Verbond voor LiberaalReligieuze Joden in Nederland Union for LiberalReligious Jews in the Netherlands is the umbrella organisation for Progressive Jews in the Netherlands and is affiliated to the World Union for Progressive Judaism It was founded in 1931

The Verbond claims a membership of some 3700 spread in ten different congregations throughout the country The biggest one is the congregation in Amsterdam with some 1700 members Other congregations exist in The Hague Rotterdam Utrecht Arnhem LJG Gelderland Tilburg LJG Brabant Enschede LJG Twente Heerenveen Zuidlaren LJG NoordNederland and Almere LJG Flevoland The NVPJs rabbis are Menno ten Brink David Lilienthal Awraham Soetendorp Edward van Voolen Marianne van Praag Tamara Benima and Albert Ringer It publishes its own magazine six times a year Levend Joods Geloof lit Living Jewish Faith

The Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom has separate organisations for women FLJVN and youngsters Netzer Holland there is also a separate Zionist organisation based on Progressive Jewish grounds ARZA It is also connected to four Jewish cemeteries one in Hoofddorp 1937 and one in Amstelveen 2002 The Liberal communities in The Hague and Rotterdam also have their own cemetery in the town of Rijswijk Beth Hachaim The cemetery was founded in 1990 after several requests from members from both communities The Congregation in Twente has its cemetery Gan haOlam in Enschede

Progressive Judaism was brought to the Netherlands in the 1930s by German immigrants many of them fleeing Nazi persecution The first Progressive rabbi in the Netherlands was Meir L Lasker followed by Germanborn Rabbi Norden The first congregation was founded in 1931 in The Hague in the same year followed by one in Amsterdam The congregations grew rapidly throughout the years mostly because of the arrival of thousands of German Jews of whom most were part of the Reform tradition On 18 October 1931 the Verbond van LiberaalGodsdienstige Joden lit Union for LiberalReligious Jews was founded Services were held regularly and the Union published its own paper Nieuw Joods Leven lit New Jewish Life

At the eve of World War II the Amsterdam community alone had some 900 members ten years earlier Progressive Judaism had virtually been nonexistent in the Netherlands  the religious landscape was limited to Ashkenazi Orthodox Judaism and a smaller community of Sephardi Jews

World War II saw the destruction of most of Jewish life in the Netherlands during the Holocaust more than 75 of Dutch Jews were killed by the Nazis But the community was vibrant and small initiatives were started in the years after the Second World War to revitalize Jewish life again although this was hard in a country where the Jewish community had diminished from more than 140000 in 1940 to a mere 25000 in the 1950s A new Liberal community was started in Amsterdam in 1946 the community had some 50 members only a fraction of the 900 six years earlier

It was not until the 1960s that Progressive Judaism started to grow once again in the Netherlands Much of its success was related to the hard work of Rabbi Jacob Soetendorp rabbi for the Liberal community in Amsterdam since 1954 Because of his hard work new communities started to spring up again within the Jewish Netherlands  sometimes much to the disagreement of the Orthodox Jewish community in the Netherlands combined in the Nederlands Isralitisch Kerkgenootschap which until this day does not fully recognize the Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom

The 1990s and the first years of the 21st century saw a new impulse to Progressive Judaism in the Netherlands with the establishment of three new communities one in Utrecht in 1993 one in Heerenveen Beth Hatsafon in 2000 and one in Almere Beth Bnei Jonah in 2003

The Levisson Instituut was founded in 2002 with the aim to provide rabbinical training for Dutch Jewish students affiliated with the NVPJ The institute is based on the premises of the University of Amsterdam and receives educational assistance from the Leo Baeck College in London amongst others 
Currently seven students are training at the Institute and are providing liturgical and pastoral support within the Liberal communities
Dean of Studies is Swedishborn Rabbi David Lilienthal

        Androgen replacement therapy
        Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

        ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

        Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

        The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

        Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

        The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

        On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

        There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

        Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

        Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

        As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

        In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

        A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

        Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

        Marathon Rowing Championship
        The Marathon Rowing Championship is a continuous rowing regatta on the Cane River Lake in Natchitoches Louisiana Northwestern State University is the official host of the regatta The Marathon begins near the Melrose Plantation and ends at Front Street in Natchitoches The regatta is open to all sculling and sweepoar rowing boats On the day of the Marathon the Cane River is open only to competitors

        The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

        The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

        The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

        Pterodactyloidea
        Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

        Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

        In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

        Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

        A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

        There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
        Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

        14Butynediol
        14Butynediol is an organic compound that is an alkyne and a diol It is a colourless hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water and polar organic solvents It is a commercially significant compound in its own right and as a precursor to other products

        14Butynediol can be produced in the Reppe synthesis where formaldehyde and acetylene are the reactants

        Several patented production methods use copper bismuth catalysts coated on an inert material The normal temperature range for the reaction is 90C up to 150C depending on the pressure used for the reaction which can range from 1 to 20 bar

        14Butynediol is a precursor to 14butanediol and 2butene14diol by hydrogenation It is also used in the manufacture of certain herbicides textile additives corrosion inhibitors plasticizers synthetic resins and polyurethanes It is the major raw material used in the synthesis of vitamin B It is also used for brightening preserving and inhibiting nickel plating

        It reacts with a mixture of chlorine and hydrochloric acid to give mucochloric acid HOCCClCClCHO see mucobromic acid

        14Butynediol is corrosive and irritates the skin eyes and respiratory tract

        Fernando Castro Pacheco
        Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

        Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

        Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

        While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

        In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

        Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

        Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

        After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

        Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

        After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

        The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

        To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

        Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

        To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

        Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

        As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

        One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

        Nathalia Crane
        Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

        After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

        Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

        She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

        Texas State Highway Loop 150
        Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

        The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

        In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

        Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

        In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

        The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

        Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

        The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

        Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

        Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

        In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

        This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

        When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

        In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

        In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

        In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

        Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

        The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

        There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

        In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

        As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

        As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

        On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release

        Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

        IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

        In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

        Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses

        To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

        Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

        Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

        NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

        Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

        An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

        The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

        Pleasant Plains New Jersey
        Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

        Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

        An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

        Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

        Since the early 19th century and possibly even earlier the area featured a oneroom schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Lairds Corner it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its oneroom schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools Moved across the road on log rollers it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development Instead it was moved to the Townships Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation

        The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area

        According to the United States Census Bureau Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3221 square miles 8342km including 3215 square miles 8328km of land and 0006 square miles 0014km of water 017

        The Pleasant Plains Cemetery located on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner was established in 1898

        Peristimulus time histogram
        In neurophysiology peristimulus time histogram and poststimulus time histogram both abbreviated PSTH or PST histogram are histograms of the times at which neurons fire It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram and poststimulus and peristimulus are often hyphenated

        The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

        To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram

        Oklahomas 2nd congressional district
        Oklahomas Second Congressional District is one of five United States Congressional districts in Oklahoma and covers approximately onefourth of the state in the east The district borders Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Texas and includes in whole or in part a total of 24 counties

        Historically the district has supported conservative Democrats and was reckoned as a classic Yellow Dog Democrat district However the growing Republican trend in the state has overtaken the district since the start of the 21st century In the last two elections the Republican presidential candidate has carried it by the largest margin in the state Urban voters represent a third of the district

        The district is represented by Republican Markwayne Mullin becoming only the second Republican after Tom Coburn to hold the seat since 1921

        The district borders Kansas to the north Missouri and Arkansas to the east and Texas along the Red River to the south It covers all or part of 26 counties It includes the remainder of Rogers County including the county seat of Claremore that is not included in the 1st District and then also all of the following counties Adair Nowata Craig Ottawa Mayes Delaware Cherokee Okmulgee Muskogee Sequoyah Okfuskee McIntosh Haskell LeFlore Hughes Pittsburg Latimer Coal Atoka Pushmataha McCurtain Choctaw Bryan Marshall and Johnston

        Some of the principal cities in the district include Miami Claremore Muskogee Tahlequah Okmulgee McAlester and Durant

        The northern half of the district includes most of the area of Oklahoma referred to as Green Country while the southern half of the district includes a part of Oklahoma often referred to as Little Dixie

        According to the 2000 US Census the district is 3551 percent urban 2395 percent nonwhite and has a population that is 240 percent Latino and 136 percent foreignborn The district has a higher percentage of Native Americans than any other congressional district in Oklahoma Its representative Markwayne Mullin is one of two Native Americans currently serving in Congress

        The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

        The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

        Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

        Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

        Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
        The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

        The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

        With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

        Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

        Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990

        In 1936 the residents asked the state government to make the settlement a town named after Manoel Urbano an Amazonian mestizo from the Manacapur region who had explored the Purus River
        In the territorial division of 31 December 1936 the region was the Castelo district of the Sena Madureira municipality
        On 1 March 1963 the municipality of Manoel Urbano was separated from Sena Madureira

        In the 2010 Census its population was 7981 divided between 5278 urban and 2703 rural
        As of 2010 the municipality ranked 5186 out of 5565 of Brazilian municipalities on the Human Development Index
        The overall index was 0551 Income was 0586 longevity was 0767 and education was 0373
        As of 1 July 2014 the estimated population was 8514

Nuclear Information and Resource Service
The Nuclear Information and Resource Service NIRS is an antinuclear group founded in 1978 to be the information and networking center for citizens and organizations concerned about nuclear power radioactive waste radiation and sustainable energy issues The organization advocates the implementation of safe sustainable solutions such as energy efficiency solar power wind power and plugin hybrids

As of 2007 NIRS claims to initiate largescale organizing and public education campaigns on specific issues such as to bring technical expertise and strategic sense to grassroots environmental groups

In 2000 NIRS affiliation with World Information Service on Energy WISE turned it into an international organization NIRSWISE

The magazine Nuclear Engineering International has said that it runs easily the best website on uranium mining throughout the world
Some of the policies endorsed by NIRS include strict controls on nuclear waste disposal bans on nuclear weapons and new power plants NIRS is opposed to ineffective nuclear waste reprocessing unsafe transportation of nuclear waste and the implementation of largescale nuclear waste repositories like Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository NIRS also does not view nuclear energy as a remedy for climate change

NIRS and WISE have merged their operations and WISE has relay offices in Amsterdam Argentina Austria the Czech Republic India Japan Russia Slovakia South Africa Sweden and the Ukraine The biweekly WISE News Communique merged with the NIRS Nuclear Monitor and covers the resistance movements working against nuclear power worldwide as well as chronicling the failings of the industry Spanish Russian and Ukrainian versions of this newsletter are also printed

Michael Mariotte 19522016 was president and executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service for 30 years He was a wellknown opponent of nuclear power and organised antinuclear activities in Europe after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster Mariotte was a keen supporter of renewable energy and efficient energy use He believed that nuclear power would become obsolete to be replaced by clean energy sources

On 15 May 2007 NIRS issued a report claiming that radioactive scrap concrete equipment asphalt plastic wood chemicals and soil from US nuclear weapons facilities are being released to regular landfills and could get into commercial recycling streams

On 3 August 2004 NIRS issued a report stating that the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission may allow the illegal practice of manually shutting down nuclear power plants in the event of fire

On 17 July 2007 regarding the leakage of water from the spent fuel pool of the KashiwazakiKariwa Nuclear Power Plant after the 2007 Niigata earthquake Michael Mariotte spoke on behalf of the NIRS and commented The leak itself doesnt sound significant as of yet but the fact that it went unreported is a concern when a company begins by denying a problem it makes you wonder if theres another shoe to drop

In October 2010 Michael Mariotte executive director of NIRS predicted that the US nuclear industry will not experience a nuclear renaissance for the simple reason that nuclear reactors make no economic sense The economic slump has driven down electricity demand and the price of competing energy sources and Congress has failed to pass climate change legislation making nuclear economics very difficult

NIRS counts the following celebrities among its supporters

Critics accuse NIRS of fearmongering and question the qualifications of NIRS staff to adequately assess the safety of nuclear energy Diane DArrigo Radioactive Waste Project Director lists no training in physics or radiological medicine which might qualify her for expertise is radioactive waste and radiation issues Other fields of study cited among the qualifications of NIRS staff include biology horticulture the history of science and advocacy No NIRS staff member is credited with formal training in nuclear physics or engineering

The organization lists only famous entertainers among its supporters None are credited with training in science or risk management expertise

In a 2008 response to NIRS claims appearing on the website palmbeachpostcom David Bradish of the Nuclear Energy Institute challenged a contention of NIRS Southeast Office Director Mary Olson that A nuclear power plant takes so much water and energy to build it has to run for 15 years to offset its carbon footprint Citing data from the World Nuclear Association Bradish argues it is reasonable to say a nuclear plant takes about one year to offset its energy consumption from its other stages At a 2006 talk before the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development Olson claimed that when fulllifecycle emissions are included the release of carbon dioxide CO2 as the result of making electricity from uranium is comparable to burning natural gas to make electric power Bradish notes I went to both of the cited studies referenced by Olson and found nothing to back up NIRS claim

County Route 16 Suffolk County New York
County Route16 CR16 is a main thoroughfare through central Suffolk County New York in the United States Its western terminus is at Middle Country Road New York State Route25 or NY25 in Smithtown on the eastern border of the Village of the Branch and its eastern terminus is at Montauk Highway CR80 in Brookhaven near Southhaven The route carries five different names along its length

CR16 begins as Terry Road at an intersection with NY25 From NY25 the road runs to the south near a former concrete factory It then crosses NY347 Several blocks south of NY347 CR16 joins Smithtown Boulevard while Terry Road continues to run south as a road maintained by the Town of Smithtown and crosses the Islip town line into Ronkonkoma A former section of Terry Road exists near NY25A It is unknown how this section connected to the present terminus of Terry Road at NY25 while traversing the surrounding terrain

Of the five roads shared by CR16 Smithtown Boulevard is the only road completely controlled by Suffolk County Not only are there no former sections but there are no sections of the road that branch off as local streets Smithtown Boulevard goes from Smithtown through Nesconset where it serves as the hamlets main street and eventually terminates in Lake Ronkonkoma east of CR93 Rosevale Avenue At one time CR76 Town Line Road was proposed to curve north of the SmithtownIslip town line and terminate between Old Nichols Road not to be confused with CR97 named Nicolls Road and Rosevale Avenue

Along the north and east side of Lake Ronkonkoma is a road known as Lake Shore Drive the northern portion of which consists mostly of CR16 except between Spectacle Lake Road and Schoolhouse Road which is maintained by the Town of Smithtown The east end of this section near Schoolhouse Road has suffered such excessive flooding that it was closed by Suffolk County and turned over to the Parks Department while the rest of it was sold to a local night club on the lake and transformed into part of the parking lot East of Schoolhouse Road however the road crosses the SmithtownBrookhaven town line and runs high along the bluffs of Lake Ronkonkoma until it reaches Portion Road CR16 moves east onto Portion Road while Lake Shore Drive continues south along the lake as a road maintained by the Town of Brookhaven

Portion Road begins at the intersection of Lake Shore Drive Old Portion Road is a former section of Portion Road located just south of that intersection Through Lake Ronkonkoma and western Farmingville CR16 crawls eastward in a hilly region of Long Island as it intersects with Ronkonkoma Avenue Hawkins Avenue CR19 PatchogueHolbrook Road and Holbrook Road before reaching an interchange with CR97 Nicolls Road where the road opens up to four lanes Suffolk County is currently planning to widen the rest of the road to four lanes This section of CR16 once carried the additional name of FarmtoMarket Road

For all intents and purposes Horseblock Road is the main section of CR16 Like Portion Road it once shared the additional name of FarmtoMarket Road Unlike the rest of CR16 Horseblock Roads western terminus is at Middle Country Road NY25 in Centereach Originally Horseblock Road was connected to another street a few blocks west of the current terminus named Mark Tree Road The two sections formed a single road that ran from South Setauket to South Haven The connection between the two streets are cut off by a shopping center on the north side of NY25 between Mark Tree and Eastwood Road It then traverses to the southsoutheast and is cut off by CR97 Nicolls Road Suffolk County Community College and other county facilities in Farmingville and joins up with Portion Road from a frontage road west of Nicolls Road named Leeds Boulevard at the interchange with Nicolls Road The section east of Nicolls Road resumes at Horseblock Place and then joins Portion Road west of Waverly Avenue

Horseblock Road then travels eastsoutheast through Farmingville home of the historic Bald Hill Schoolhouse and Cotten Coverage Insurance Agency intersecting Blue Point Road Granny Road and CR83 North Ocean Avenue and then narrows down to two lanes eventually entering Medford intersecting NY112 the Long Island Expressway at exit65 and CR101 PatchogueYaphank Road It then enters southern Yaphank and Brookhaven where it intersects CR99 Woodside Avenue a road whose construction in the early 1970s lead to Horseblock Roads realignment and then CR21 Yaphank Avenue where it shares an interchange with Sunrise Highway NY27 before terminating at CR80 Montauk Highway in Brookhaven

The segment between Ronkonkoma and South Haven was built by the Works Progress Administration and gave the Portion Road and Horse Block Road southeast of Portion the dual name of Farm to Market Road in the hopes of giving farmers of southeastern Long Island an accessible road to western segments of Long Island 

Though CR16 has run consistently from Smithtown to Brookhaven since the mid1960s this wasnt always the case Many segments have been part of other county roads

East Lake Shore Terrace Drive and Portion Road used to be part of CR19 from the SmithtownBrookhaven Town Line to Waverly Avenue in Farmingville In 1960 this terminus was moved to PatchogueHolbrook Road
The construction of Sunrise Highway in 1957 lead to the realignment of Horseblock Road west of its original eastern terminus with South Country Road former Montauk Highway in South Haven Because the interchange is shared with CR21 the new alignment was originally designated as CR21A
Horseblock Road used to be a western extension of CR56 between Victory Avenue a frontage road along Sunrise Highway that begins at CR46 in Brookhaven and Waverly Avenue in Farmingville In 1964 it was moved only to Victory Avenue The frontage road was mainly unmarked until the 2010s

HMS Cherub 1806
HMS Cherub was an 18gun Royal Navy sloop built in Dover in 1806 She participated in two major campaigns in the West Indies during the Napoleonic Wars and one major engagement in the Pacific during the War of 1812 all each of which earned her crews clasps to the Naval General Service Medal The Navy sold her in 1820

Commander John Ravenshaw commissioned Cherub in April for the North Sea Cherub is listed among the vessels qualifying for prize money arising out of the battle of Copenhagen On the way there Cherub and detained the Danish ship Neptunus on 30 August Cherub sent Neptune or Neptunus which had been sailing from Stockholm to Holstein into Sheerness Slightly earlier she supported the Swedes at the defence of Stralsund and Rgen

On 29 February 1808 Cherub sailed for the Leeward Islands From April to midJune 1808 Cherub and cruised in company and agreed to share any prizes they captured Around 9 May Cherub captured the privateer schooner Vaillante Dubois master which was armed with swivel guns and small arms Her crew abandoned her and escaped ashore leaving behind one man who was sick and who died the next day Cherub and Nimrod then used the schooner as a tender On 17 May Nimrod captured a Spanish schooner carrying hides cocoa and indigo She was the Esther sailing from La Guayra to Teneriffe Lastly on 22 May Cherub and Nimrod jointly captured a Spanish letter of marque brig after a brief exchange of fire when the British sent in a boarding party in boats after her crew had run her ashore She was armed with two guns and four howitzers but her crew abandoned her before the boarding party arrived She had been carrying a cargo of cocoa from Cumano to Barcelona when the British intercepted her The British were able to retrieve her though not without difficulty Nimrod then took the prizes into St Thomas There the estimates were that the brigs cargo was worth about 20000 and the Spanish schooner about 1200

On 20 November   Cherub  and participated in the capture of Bonetta Intrepid and Mary and Allen The last prize money was paid in 1839 In December Commander Thomas Tudor Tucker transferred from to take command of Cherub

On 23 January 1809 Captain William Maude of returned to his station off BasseTerre Guadeloupe where he had left Cherub to watch the French frigate that was taking shelter there

In early June 1809 Cherub and sailed into the anchorage at BasseTerre to cut out two French frigates lying there under the protection of a fort and some batteries As they sailed in they were subject to fire from shore batteries which had no effect The wind suddenly failed the British vessels which were nevertheless able to extricate themselves from the situation with no losses or damage but no success either

On 18 June and Cherub captured one of the French frigates  At the time of her capture Flicit was armed with only 14 guns but had 174 men on board She had left Guadeloupe in company with another frigate and was sailing to France with colonial produce The second frigate escaped through superior sailing despite Cherub having conducted a long chase captured the second frigate  on 5 July 1809 Latona and Cherub shared the prize money with the other vessels that had formed the blockade of the Saintes Amaranthe Blonde   Julia and 

Next Cherub took part in the invasion of Guadeloupe in early 1810 This time 50 vessels shared in the prize money In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal NGSM with clasp Guadaloupe to all surviving claimants from the campaign

On 1 August 1811 Tucker received promotion to post captain Cherub was reclassed as a sixth rate to permit him to continue in command

Cherub remained on the Leeward Islands station until 3 July 1812 when she returned to England for a refit On this voyage she convoyed some 70 to 80 vessels or 96 Cherub arrived in September and the crew received one months leave apparently all returned to duty even though they had been away from Britain for some years and expected to sail again for more years abroad A newspaper report dated 9 October from Halifax reported that Prince of Asturias from St Marys Straker master which Cherub had recaptured had arrived there The account did not specify either the date of recapture nor arrival

On 19 December 1812 Cherub left Cork with a convoy of 12 vessels eight for Brazil two for Buenos Aires and one for the South Seas Several separated and on 12 January captured Volunteer and the next day another vessel from the convoy Still on 24 January 1813 Cherub still had seven vessels with her

Cherub sailed from Rio de Janeiro on 8 July in company with and  sailing around Cape Horn

On 8 February 1814 Phoebe and Cherub found Essex at Valparaiso They waited off the port for Essex to come out On the afternoon of 28 March Essex sailed but she lost her main topmast and anchored near the shore Phoebe and Cherub also anchored and opened fire The British were armed with long guns which were more effective at a longer range than the American armament of carronades As the British anchored out of effective range of the American carronades the battle was very onesided and lasted for an hour until Captain David Porter of Essex struck his colours with 23 dead and 42 wounded on board On the British ships only five were killed Phoebe and Cherub also captured Essexs tender  which they then used as a cartel to transport their prisoners to New York In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasps Cherub 28 March 1814 and Phoebe 28 March 1814 to all surviving claimants from the battle

On 31 May Phoebe and Essex set sail for England finally anchoring in Plymouth sound on 13 November The Admiralty repaired Essex taking her into service as HMS Essex

Suez Canal Bridge
The Mubarak Peace Bridge also known as the EgyptianJapanese Friendship Bridge Al Salam Bridge or Al Salam Peace Bridge is a road bridge crossing the Suez Canal at ElQantara whose name means the bridge in Arabic The bridge links the continents of Africa and Asia

The bridge was built with assistance from the Japanese government The main contractor was Kajima Corporation

The Japanese grant accounting for 60 of the construction cost or 135 billion yen was agreed to during the visit of thenPresident Hosni Mubarak to Japan in March 1995 as part of a larger project to develop the Sinai Peninsula Egypt bore the remaining 40 9 billion yen The bridge was opened in October 2001

The bridge which has a clearance over the canal and is long consists of a cablestayed main span and two long approach spans

The height of the two main pylons supporting the main span is each The towers were designed in the shape of Pharaonic obelisks

The clearance under the bridge is 70 metres Therefore the maximum height of ships that can pass through the Suez Canal Suezmax is 68 metres above the waterline

The Suez Canal Bridge was part of a major drive to develop the areas surrounding the Suez Canal including other projects such as the Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel under the Suez Canal completed in 1981 the El Ferdan Railway Bridge and the Suez Canal overhead powerline crossing

<doc id="7744414" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7744414" title="Customer attrition">
Customer attrition
Customer attrition also known as customer churn customer turnover or customer defection is the loss of clients or customers

Banks telephone service companies Internet service providers pay TV companies insurance firms and alarm monitoring services often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics along with cash flow EBITDA etc because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients because recovered longterm customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients

Companies usually make a distinction between voluntary churn and involuntary churn Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customers relocation to a longterm care facility death or the relocation to a distant location In most applications involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn because it typically occurs due to factors of the companycustomer relationship which companies control such as how billing interactions are handled or how aftersales help is provided

When companies are measuring their customer turnover they typically make the distinction between gross attrition and net attrition Gross attrition is the loss of existing customers and their associated recurring revenue for contracted goods or services during a particular period Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation called Monthly Recurring Revenue or MRR In the 2000s there are also a number of business intelligence software programs which can mine databases of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support billing disputes or a disagreement over company policies More sophisticated predictive analytics software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn

Financial services such as banking and insurance use applications of predictive analytics for churn modeling because customer retention is an essential part of most financial services business models Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics including retailing telecommunications and payTV operators One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future Some companies want to prevent their good customers from deteriorating eg by falling behind in their payments and becoming less profitable customers so they introduced the notion of partial customer churn

Customer attrition merits special attention by mobile telecom service providers worldwide This is due to the low barriers to switching to a competing service provider especially with the advent of Mobile Number Portability MNP in several countries This allows customers to switch to another provider while preserving their phone numbers While mature markets with high teledensity phone market penetration have churn rates ranging from 1 to 2 per month high growth developing markets such as India and China are experiencing churn rates between 3 to 4 per month By deploying new technologies such churn prediction models coupled with effective retention programs customer attrition could be better managed to stem the significant revenue loss from defecting customers

Customer attrition is a major concern for US and Canadian banks because they have much higher churn rates than banks in Western Europe US and Canadian banks with the lowest churn rates have achieved customer turnover rates as low as 12 per year by using tactics such as free checking accounts online banking and bill payment and improved customer service However once banks can improve their churn rates by improving customer service they can reach a point beyond which further customer service will not improve retention other tactics or approaches need to be explored

Churn or Customer attrition is often used as an indicator of customer satisfaction However the churn rate can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services This can include ignoring resiliations requests implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an average consumer and various other barriers to resiliation Thus churn can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates This practice is short sighted and will backfire However it was shown to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers

Scholars have studied customer attrition at European financial services companies and investigated the predictors of churn and how the use of customer relationship management CRM approaches can impact churn rates Several studies combine several different types of predictors to develop a churn model This model can take demographic characteristics environmental changes and other factors into account

Research on customer attrition data modeling may provide businesses with several tools for enhancing customer retention Using data mining and software one may apply statistical methods to develop nonlinear attrition causation models One researcher notes that retaining existing customers is more profitable than acquiring new customers due primarily to savings on acquisition costs the higher volume of service consumption and customer referrals The argument is that to build an effective customer retention program managers have to come to an understanding of why customers leave and identify the customers with high risk of leaving by accurately predicting customer attrition

In the business context churn refers both to customers migration and to their loss of value So churn rate refers on the one hand to the percentage of customers who end their relation with the organization or on the other hand to the customers who still receive their services but not as much or not as often as they used to
Current organizations face therefore a huge challenge to be able to anticipate to customers abandon in order to retain them on time reducing this way costs and risks and gaining efficiency and competitivity
There are in the market advanced analytics tools and applications especially designed to analyze in depth the enormous amount of data inside the organizations and to make predictions based on the information obtained from analyzing and exploring those data They aim to put at the service of marketing departments and agencies and of all business users the necessary weapons to

There are organizations that have developed international standards regarding recognition and sharing of global best practice in customer service in order to reduce customer attrition The International Customer Service Institute has developed The International Customer Service Standard to strategically align organizations so they focus on delivering excellence in customer service whilst at the same time providing recognition of success through a 3rd Party registration scheme

Not all customer attrition is bad For many firms it is useful and desirable that unprofitable customers should churn away This is known as customer divestment of unprofitable customers However simply because a customer is unprofitable does not mean that the customer should be divested because there are strategic reasons for retaining unprofitable customers

Aarni
Aarni has been described as an avantgarde metal band from Finland which consists primarily of Master Warjomaa and occasionally some session musicians Although many sources claim the existence of other band members these may be fictional characters probably created by Warjomaa himself and include a French count born in the 17th century Count of SaintGermain a cartoon character with a Tshirt with Aarnis logo Doomintroll and an old woman Mistress Palm

Aarnis music bears similarities to funeral doom metal in Reaching Azathoth for example and has sometimes similarities to folk metal The Weird of Vipunen Their style has been described as almost orthodox doom metallish LovecraftianJungian Kalevala avantgarde music The band themselves sometimes use the term Chthonic Musick The lyrics of Aarni include varied themes such as Finnish folklore transhumanism Lovecraft paganism parapsychology psychoanalytical theories and mythology The lyrics have been sung in English Finnish Latin and occasionally in Enochian Ancient Egyptian Ouranian Barbaric Swedish and Glossolalic

Aarni was founded in 1998 in Finland by Master Warjomaa occasionally known as Mahatma M Warjomaa Master Warjomaa is also an active member of a doom metal band called Umbra Nihil playing lead guitar Aarni released a demo in 2001 and a split album with Umbra Nihil the following year After a second demo in 2002 Aarni finally released its first fulllength album Bathos in 2004 Aarni was signed to Firebox Recordss subsidiary label Firedoom Music but is now signed to Epidemie Records Aarni released their second album called Tohcoth in February 2008 In late 2008 Aarni also released a CDR EP titled Omnimantia In April 2012 Aarni released a split album with Persistence in Mourning

On Aarnis official website the band section contains four members also referred to as Responsible Cultists as well as information concerning each of them The four members of the band are Master Warjomaa Comte de SaintGermain Doomintroll and Mistress Palm Warjomaa commented on this in a 2004 interview

The number of Aarni is five and five is the number of Aarni Think a while about this and you will see because Aarni consists of four personalities plus me Why four Because Ive chosen to adhere to the Jungian concept of quaternity  four personality types four seasons four equinoxes four elements four stations of the sun four stages of the human life four cardinal directions four Qabbalistic worlds four limbs of the human body four main themes in Aarnis songs four basic human brain circuits of Timothy Learys theory etc Visualize the pentagram representing human existence theres four points combined inruled by the fifth Its all of course symbolic Or is it

Master Warjomaa is the alias of the bands most stable member According to the bands official website Warjomaa was born in 1974 It is stated that he is influenced by Joe Satriani Taoism Camel and H P Lovecraft that he belongs to the Homo Superior species and that his favorite place is Cydonia Along with many other artists Warjomaa has named Black Sabbath Candlemass Hawkwind King Crimson and Van der Graaf Generator as his musical influences In a fan interview in June 2006 Warjomaa stated
While I prefer a female unicorn deity to a gaseous alpha male vertebrate of cosmic heft anytime Id rather choose no deity or deities at all I think its high time we stopped worshiping gods and started to aim at becoming gods
Le Comte de Saint Germain translated from French The Count of Saint Germain is one of the members of Aarni His role in the band has been stated as Sensation alchemical processes and keys to secrets It is written that he was born in 1665 and is an exhuman It is not stated whether le Comte de Saint Germain was an actual individual that lived centuries ago or if he is an entirely fictional character It may be possible that le Comte de Saint Germain has something to do with the Count of St Germain an actual count living in the 18th century

Doomintroll has been represented by a cartoonstyle drawing of a person with a very prominent nose a pipe in the mouth the Aarni logo on the Tshirt and a hand sticking up the middle finger According to Aarni he originated in 1998 also the date of the formation of Aarni which would make him 6 years old at the time of the release of the bands first fulllength album It is written that Doomintroll belongs to the Duumipeikko species Duumipeikko roughly translated from Finnish gives Doomintroll This is a reference to the popular Finnish cartoon series Moomin in which Muumipeikko is one of the main characters According to Doomintroll the band wants to support the anarchoshamanistic attitude of moomintrolls

Mistress Palm also referred to as Mrs Palm is the fourth claimed band member She is depicted as a rather elderly woman in an apron holding a dish brush and opening her mouth in dismay She has been thought to be a computer program or artificial phlogistondriven rectoplasm

At the top of the band page is written 41 The motive of this equation is maybe to consider the situation of the 4 declared members and one actual member andor can be a reference to the Jungian concept of quaternity On the news page also referred to as the Unspeakable Tidings the news are listed chronologically However the dates are said to be written in the form corresponding to these in the Discordian calendar These dates follow the DDSSYYYY form as stated on the official website Therefore eg the year 2007 CE is noted as 3173 AM

The lyrics have been sung in English Finnish Latin and occasionally in French Ancient Egyptian Glossolalic Swedish Ouranian Barbaric and Enochian In several songs the lyrics refer to the Cthulhu Mythos

In Squaring The Circle the lyrics say zero equals two This may be a reference to the ideas of Aleister Crowley and similar to the 41 statement on top of the band page of the official website In The Thunder Perfect Mindfuck it is said I am the shameless and I am ashamed as well as I am falsehood and I am truth These could be considered paradoxical and controversial as the Gnostic poem the lyrics seem to be based upon The Thunder Perfect Mind


Demo 2001 was released independently by Aarni in 2001 It was the first CD release of Aarni Its cover features a picture of the Conte de SaintGermain

Persona Mortuae Cutis appears as a cover version of the Slayer song Dead Skin Mask translated to Latin

Aarni  Umbra Nihil Split was released through Firebox Records in 2002



Duumipeikon paluu was released independently by Aarni in 2002

Duumipeikon paluu and Demo 2001 were rereleased together in 2003 and rerereleased as a remaster in late 2008 Duumipeikon paluu translated from Finnish means The Return of Doomintroll

Bathos was released through Firedoom Music a sublabel of Firebox Records on November 8 2004

VV from Umbra Nihil played session drums on the album Oneiroscope means an instrument for watching dreams VITRIOL is an acronym for Visita interiora terrae rectificandoque invenies occultum lapidem in Latin meaning Visit the innermost of the earth and by rectifying what is there you will find the hidden stone The Thunder Perfect Mindfuck refers to the gnostic poem The Thunder Perfect Mind

The Bathos cover was painted by Tuomas M Mkel of the ambient band Jportit based partially on an earlier artwork he had done 
Magister Warjomaa said about it We wanted a colourful cover because I feel very bored with the usual darkhued album art most metal bands choose for some pathetic reason But mainly we wanted that cover because to us it has a spacedout candlylike and pleasing feeling THC green feels such a beautiful color

Pandemia is the name of a song by Aarni that was only released on internet available only on the official Aarni website It was originally recorded in 2002 and was later remixed and released on the internet in July 2003

Tohcoth was released through Epidemie Records on February 19 2008 The Enochian title was taken from the works of Dr John Dee This name comprehendeth the number of all the fayries who are diuels next to the state and condition of man This album featured Sampo Marjomaa as a guest vocalist

West African Gas Pipeline
The West African Gas Pipeline WAGP is a natural gas pipeline to supply gas from Nigerias Escravos region of Niger Delta area to Benin Togo and Ghana It is the first regional natural gas transmission system in subSaharan Africa
The project began in 1982 when the Economic Community of West African States ECOWAS proposed the development of a natural gas pipeline throughout West Africa In 1991 a feasibility report conducted by the World Bank on supplying Nigerian gas on West African markets deemed that a project was commercially viable

In September 1995 the governments of four African countries signed a Heads of State Agreement The feasibility study was carried out in 1999 On 11 August 1999 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by participating countries in Cotonou Benin In February 2000 an InterGovernmental Agreement was signed The WAGP implementation agreement was signed in 2003 Groundbreaking ceremonies for the project were held at SekondiTakoradi Ghana on 3 December 2004 Construction began in 2005

The offshore pipeline was completed in December 2006 and was scheduled to start operating on 23 December 2007 but was delayed after leaks were detected in supply pipelines in Nigeria The second delivery deadline was scheduled on 13 February 2008 but regular deliveries were delayed again when one of the contractors of Willbros was shot and killed in Nigeria by armed robbers

Gas deliveries were expected by the end of 2009 after commissioning regulating and metering stations in Takoradi and Tema Ghana Lagos Beach Nigeria Cotonou Benin and Lom Togo in May 2008 However deliveries were postponed again due to an irregular amount of moisture found inside the onshore gas pipeline

The pipeline consists three sections with a total length of  The long offshore section starts at starts the Itoki terminal in southeastern Nigeria and runs through the waters of Benin Togo and Ghana parallel to the coastline approximately to offshore in water depths of between and  The Nigerian onshore section of the pipeline connects the offshore section compressor station at Lagos Beach with the Chevronowned EscravosLagos Pipeline System operational since 1989 It is possible that later the WAGP will be extended to Cte dIvoire and in longer term even to Senegal

The diameter of the onshore section is  The diameter of the offshore pipeline is and the capacity is 5billion cubic meter bcm of natural gas per year The pipeline was constructed by Willbros with Bredero Shaw Ltd applying a concrete coating to the pipeline at its facility in Tema Ghana The precommissioning services were provided by BJ Process and Pipeline Services The total pipeline costs around US974million for which the World Bank provided a guarantee of 50million for Ghana while the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency provided a 75million political risk guarantee for WAGPo as a whole

The pipeline is owned by West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited WAGPCo a consortium of Chevron 367 Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 25 Royal Dutch Shell 18 Volta River Authority of Ghana 163 Socit Togolaise de Gaz SoToGaz  2 and Socit Beninoise de Gaz SA SoBeGaz  2 The managing director of the company is Walter Perez It is operated by Chevron Corporation

In Ghana provided gas was intended for the Takoradi Power Station at Aboadze near Takoradi operated by Volta River Authority and the Takoradi International Companys TICO As of 2014 however most of the gas was being consumed in Lagos

Environmental group Friends of the Earth has criticized the project after local communities in Nigeria complained it would damage land destroy livelihoods and pollute fishing areas

On August 27 2012 the West African Gas Pipeline was damaged when pirates who had tried to board an oil tanker in an attempt to get away from the pursuing Togolese Navy severely damaged the pipeline with their anchor For nearly a year the supply of gas to Ghana Togo and Benin ceased causing major power supply problems to the affected countries

In the words of the Mayor of Londons office it was a newsletter for Londoners from the Mayor of London It provided information about the policies and services delivered by the Greater London Authority and key issues affecting life in the capital and encouraged participation in current debates and consultation

According to the Mayors Annual Report 200506 the budget for The Londoner was 2882000 of which 632000 came directly from the GLA precept portion of council tax paid by London householders Most of the remaining 2250000 came from advertising and editorial material paid for by Transport for London and the Metropolitan Police Authority

Costing 28 million a year to fund many stated that the publication was expensive propaganda It became the topic of many heated blog articles particularly those who criticised the mayor Ken Livingstone Those targeting the Londoner attack what they saw as political bias for example putting the Venezuela flag on an advertisement for bus travel

The succeeding Mayor Boris Johnson scrapped The Londoner as part of his mayoral manifesto pledge describing it as the Mayors ludicrous Pyongyangstyle newspaper Johnson pledged to use up to 1 million of the saved money to plant 10000 trees

Lehigh Canal
The Lehigh Canal or the Lehigh Navigation Canal is a navigable canal beginning at the mouth of Nesquehoning Creek on the Lehigh River in Eastern Pennsylvania It was built in two sections over a span of twenty years beginning in 1818 The lower section spanned the distance between Easton Pennsylvania and the town of Mauch Chunk presentday Jim Thorpe Pennsylvania In Easton the canal met the Delaware and Morris Canals with which goods could be brought further up the east coast At its height the Lehigh Canal was long

Although the canal was used to transport a variety of products its most significant cargoes were anthracite coal and pig iron Cornerstones of the American Industrial Revolution they defined the character of the towns surrounding the canal

The route consisted of the canals and dammedoff sections of the Lehigh River Boatmen had to navigate their barges periodically from the canal through a lock onto the river or vice versa This design saved time and money while the canal was being built although it made for a slower more difficult trip for canalboat captains

The Lehigh Coal Mine Company LCMC was founded in 1792 a few months after anthracite was discovered at Sharpe Mountain a peak of the Pisgah Ridge near presentday Summit Hill Pennsylvania Its principals secured rights to over before the Lehigh Canal was built The company found it fairly easy to find and mine coal from a pit on the mountainside the coal had to be loaded into sacks and then onto pack animals which carried the coal at least to the Lehigh shore Disposable skiffs known as arks were built from local timber which were manned along the lower Lehigh River rapids Despite many politically connected stockholders and officers the operation was unsupervised by upper management
With no officer willing to manage from the field the LCMC hired contractors or sent out teams this was only sporadically successful in getting coal to Philadelphia Firewood and charcoal were expensive and hard to find in the eastern US by the War of 1812 Before the war the LCMCs record of getting coal to market was so dismal that coal imported from England was cheaper and more readily available The war gave the company an incentive to send another expedition by independent contractors in 1813 After a year they had built five boats but brought only two to market this resulted in another loss for the company The loss was the last straw for many of the companys backers who were unwilling to fund more expeditions despite the two boats bought back by White and Hazard

The Lehigh Coal  Navigation Company its founder Josiah White and Whites protege and partner Erskine Hazard operations managers into the mid1860s established a reputation for innovation White and Hazard researched or invented emerging technologies as needed pioneering industrial innovations including the first wire suspension bridge over the Schuylkill River
The lower canal began as a collection of removed stone obstructions and low rock dams with a system of wooden beartrap locks invented by Lehigh Navigation Company managing partner Josiah White who debugged scale models of the lock design on Mauch Chunk Creek Experiments with the beartrap locks gave Bear Lane an alley in Mauch Chunk off Broadway in todays Jim Thorpe Pennsylvania its name White and partner Erskine Hazard who operated a wire mill foundry and nail factory at the Falls of the Schuylkill needed energy After learning the value of anthracite during the British blockades in 1814 White and Hazard joined a number of Philadelphians in a jointstock venture to build the Schuylkill Canal but quarreled with those on the board of managers who did not favor rapid development They learned that the managers of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company were willing to option their rights because of their longterm inability to make a profit by transporting anthracite nearly from Pisgah Ridge The Lehigh Navigation Company held a charter to improve the navigability of the Lehigh River but had accomplished little and the charter would expire in 1817 White and Hazard made a proposal specifying improvements for downriver navigation only and received a charter giving the company ownership of the river in March 1818 The charter had a fallback provision allowing the legislature to require improvements enabling twoway navigation

Sometimes called The Stone Coal Turnpike the lower canal  was built by the Lehigh Navigation Company as a toll road to supply coal to Eastern seaboard cities between 1818 and 1820 downriver traffic only It was rebuilt with locks supporting twoway traffic between 1827 and 1829 by the Lehigh Coal  Navigation Company and remained in operation until 1931 The lower canal connected the eastern part of the southern Coal Region to the Delaware River basin primarily the Panther Creek Valley Nesquehoning Creek Valley and mines in Beaver Meadows and along Black Creek connecting via Penn Haven Junction to the canal head at Mauch Chunk now Jim Thorpe Pennsylvania 
The lower canal began below Packers Dam A wing wall projected into the upper pool to create slack water next to the loading docks at the same level as the top of the first guard dam That dam known as Dam 1 was downstream of Broadway opposite Flagstaff Hill and the crosscanal Bear Mountain for which Mauch Chunk was named The 44 lift locks begin with Lock 1 at the dam This was a weighing lock using a platform which lifted a barge and weighed the boat and its load Each nonLCNC barge on the canal was recorded Empty weights were subtracted and tolls were assessed by the ton per mile traveled Most of the 44 locks on the descent to Easton PA were spillway variants of Whites beartrap lock When tipped or triggered they released several acrefeet creating a wave to raise the water level as the canal boat sank downriver The canal carried central Lehigh Valley anthracite to northeastern urban markets particularly Philadelphia Trenton and Wilmington and supporting new industry in Bristol Allentown and Bethlehem Pennsylvania with the Morris and Delaware and Raritan Canals and a number of railroads The privately funded canal became part of the Pennsylvania Canal system a complex of canals towpaths and eventually railroads It was last used for cargo in 1942 and the LCN Company was sold to Pennsylvania for preservation and recreational use in 1964 Portions of the canal and the later rail lines flanking it are part of the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor a multiuse rail trail

The lower canal improvements were initially designed and engineered by LCN founder Josiah White after the company become disenchanted with the Schuylkill Canals board of directors By the winter of 1814 the company was interested in transporting Lehigh Valley coal to Philadelphia

By late 1822 skepticism about anthracite was waning The cost of building an ark for every load of coal delivered to the Philadelphia docks in 1822 as LCN operations were hitting their stride worried the companys board of directors By mid1822 managing director Josiah White was consulting with veteran ErieCanal lock engineer Canvass White By late in the year White had shifted construction efforts from improving the oneway system begun in 1818 to a test project on the four upper dams of the canal The project involved twoway dams and locks with a wider lift channel and lengths of over  capable of taking a steam tug and a coastal cargo ship from from the Delaware to the slackwater pool at Mauch Chunk In 1823 White and Hazard proposed a plan to the Pennsylvania legislature

In 1823 after building and testing four locks Josiah White made a proposal to the Pennsylvania legislature to continue the improvements down the Lehigh River His plan included locks suitable for a coastal schooner and towing steam tug the types of boats which dominated ports along the of the Delaware River controlled by the LCN The following year the legislature rejected his proposal lumber and timber interests feared that damming would prevent them from rafting logs on the rivers to local sawmills White and Hazard scrambled to increase mine production while producing enough lumber for arks to send their coal along the Delaware to Philadelphia In 1827 a revision to the Main Line of Public Works funded the promised Delaware Canal The LCN began converting the canal to support twoway operation work which continued into 1829 In 1831 the LCN stopped making oneway arks and began building large durable barges expecting their return via a connection with the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal in Easton

The expanded Lehigh Canal extended  between Mauch Chunk and Easton Its 52 locks eight guard locks eight dams and six aqueducts allowed the waterway to rise over in elevation A weigh lock south of Mauch Chunk determined canalboat fees A cableferry connection across the Delaware River to the Morris Canal and through New Jersey created a moredirect route from the Lehigh Canal to New York City To the south the Delaware and Raritan Canal had a complementary canal built along the east bank of the Delaware

Inspired by the successful transport of freight over the Allegheny Front escarpment via the Allegheny Portage Railroad system during the mid1830s the business community and the legislature sought a extension The Upper Lehigh Canal designed by Canvass White was built from 1837 to 1843 as authorized by the 1837 revision of the Main Line of Public Works

The upper Lehigh was a turbulent river with steep sides a large portion was in a ravine the Lehigh Gorge The upper canal rose over in elevation to the Mauch Chunk slackwater pool Unlike the lower canal where most locks lifted less than in easy stages the uppercanal design relied on deeplift locks The maximum lift on the lower canal was less than  but the uppercanal locks lifted a maximum of  this is comparable to the lift of the lower canal in a bit over half the distance using less than as many locks per mile The upper canal designs 20 dams 29 locks and a number of reservoirs provided working flow even in dry summers 
The project included four major construction hurdles and three new railroad projects for which LCN created a new subsidiary the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad LHS From north to south the rail projects were

The canals collapse began when a wet spring in 1862 repeatedly overfilled embankment dam reservoirs until the dam above White Haven failed triggering a cascade of failing dams in a flood on June 4 Between 100 or 200 lives were lost in the villages and canal works below the number varying by source The Pennsylvania legislature forbade the rebuilding of the upper canal The canal was used for transportation until the 1940s about a decade after similar canals ceased operations and it was North Americas last fully functioning towpath canal In 1962 most of it was sold to private and public organizations for recreational use

Several segments of the canal were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 including Lehigh Canal Carbon County Section of the Lehigh Canal 79002179 Lehigh Canal Eastern Section Glendon and Abbott Street Industrial Sites 78002437 and Lehigh Canal Allentown to Hopeville Section 79002307 For the Carbon County section also known as Upper Canal Lock 1 to Lower Canal Dam 3 the listing included 30 contributing structures

The eastern section now preserved as a recreationalboating area runs along the Lehigh River from Hopeville to the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers in Easton and includes the Chain Bridge which was NRHPlisted in 1974 The easternsection listing is for a area with three contributing buildings seven contributing sites and 11 contributing structures The AllentowntoHopeville section is a area which includes Greek Revival and Federal architecture in its contributing building and 13 contributing structures

An 8mile 13km segment of the canal towpath has been converted into a multiuse trail from Freemansburg through Bethlehem to Allentown The trail runs along the river and active railroad tracks A section near Jim Thorpe is also accessible to recreational users The final section in Easton is maintained and operated by the National Canal Museum Other short sections are accessible but portions of the canal towpath are worn and unsafe to access

The American Coalition of Life Activists ACLA was a prolife advocacy group that was the subject of controversy for its series of Wantedstyle posters

During a 1995 meeting the group unveiled a wanted poster that listed the names and addresses of a Deadly Dozen abortion providers The poster accused them of crimes against humanity and offered a 5000 reward for the arrest conviction and revocation of license to practice medicine of these physicians The poster was published in Life Advocate magazine A second poster targeted a specific person Dr Robert Crist offered a reward for persuading him to turn from his child killing and included his name address and photo

In 1996 it revealed its Nuremberg Files which included dossiers on abortion providers politicians judges clinic employees and other abortion rights supporters The ACLA claimed that these dossiers could be used for trials for crimes against humanity when the nations laws changed to prohibit abortion Neal Horsley an activist published the information on his website His website greyed the names of those injured and crossed out the names of those killed by antiabortion activists

Planned Parenthood successfully sued the ACLA Although the posters and website did not contain any specific threat the jury awarded 107 million The ACLA appealed the verdict on First Amendment grounds A panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals initially overturned the verdict holding that the activities of the ACLA were protected under the First Amendment because they did not directly threaten harm to the plaintiffs and because the ACLAs statements were not communicated privately to the plaintiffs The en banc 9th Circuit reversed the panelhttpnewsfindlawcomhdocsdocsabortionppacla51602opnpdf and held that the ACLA could be held liable in damages because the website made a deliberate threat with the expectation that someone would act on it unprotected by the First Amendment

In the 1860s early settlers came to the area to graze their flocks but the first official records of it began in 1889 when the Great Southern Railway opened and a siding called Buchanan River was opened In 1897 the Government set aside land for subdivision here and in 1903 lots were surveyed and the town of Buchanan gazetted The land agent at Katanning reported considerable interest and a hall school and other facilities had been completed by 1904

However the name clashed with a town in New South Wales now little more than a historic gallery outside Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Region so the town was renamed Barton in 1905 to honour Australias first prime minister 19011903 Sir Edmund Barton However after the construction of the TransAustralian Railway in 1917 another railway station named after Barton in the South Australian stretch of the Nullarbor Plain led to another name change  this time to Piesse after two prominent residents Frederick Henry Piesse and Charles Austin Piesse in December 1918 Five years later the town was changed to its present name  its fourth in 20 years

Payton v New York
Payton v New York 445 US 573 1980 was a United States Supreme Court case concerning warrantless entry into a private home in order to make a felony arrest The Court struck down a New York statute providing for such warrantless entries because the Fourth Amendment draws a firm line at the entrance to the house Absent exigent circumstances that threshold may not be reasonably crossed without a warrant The court however did specify that an arrest warrant as opposed to a search warrant would have sufficed for entry into the suspects residence if there had been reason to believe that the suspect was within the home

Payton and related case law establish that the principle that a person in a home particularly his or her own is entitled Fourth Amendment protections not afforded to persons in automobiles as per Whren v United States or to persons in public as per United States v Watson

Theodore Payton of New York City was suspected of murdering an employee of a gas station in the city Thinking Payton was home the New York City police forcibly entered Paytons home Payton was in fact not home and the police gathered evidence from his home connecting him to the murder of the gas station attendant The police acted under a New York law allowing police to enter a private residence to make a felony arrest without a warrant At his trial Payton was unable to have the evidence thrown out and his conviction was upheld at the appellate level The judge noted that the police entering Paytons house was authorized by the New York law and therefore was permissible

Rudolf Kreitlein
Rudolf Kreitlein 14 November 1919 in Frth  31 July 2012 in Stuttgart was a German international football referee active in the 1960s

Kreitlein is perhaps best known for having refereed the 1966 World Cup quarterfinal match between England and Argentina in which he dismissed Antonio Rattn from the field of play in the 35th minute of the game for a second caution  dissent Rattn initially refused to leave the pitch arguing furiously with Kreitlein even though neither man understood each others native language and the game was held up for several minutes until Rattn reluctantly departed It was also during that game that Jack Charlton was cautioned only to discover the fact the next day from the newspaper report As a result of this incident Kreitlein and Ken Aston developed the idea of yellow cards and red cards to aid onfield communication in football Kreitlein who had never seen the match requested a copy of the game from the Football Association in 2006 Kreitlein retired from international competition in 1967

Kreitlein began his refereeing career at the age of 17 and soon moved to the USA to train referees He subsequently returned to Germany where he tried to become a professional footballer However a serious knee injury ended this aspiration and he concentrated on refereeing instead Kreitleins rise to prominence within the European game was evident prior to the World Cup He had been appointed as one of the German representatives for the 1963 UEFA Youth Championship in England refereeing the final between England and Northern Ireland at Wembley his assistants were the Hungarian orchestral conductor and referee Istvn Zsolt and the Belgian Mark Raemaekers

Kreitlein had been a Bundesliga referee from its inauguration in 1963 but had only refereed 36 matches at national level before being appointed referee in May 1966 to the European Cup Final where he took charge of the game between Real Madrid and Partizan Belgrade in Brussels

Kreitlein worked as a tailor He was married but had no children His wife died in 2008

Beacon Theatres Inc v Westover
Beacon Theatres v Westover 359 US 500 1959 was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States dealing with jury trials in civil matters The court held that where legal and equitable claims are joined in the same action the legal claims must be tried by a jury before the equitable claims can be resolved

The following explanation can be found at the Cornell Law School  Legal Information Institute  United States Constitution site at httpswwwlawcornelleduannconhtmlamdt7frag3userhtml

In Beacon Theatres v Westover the Court held that a district court erred in trying all issues itself in an action in which the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction barring the defendant from instituting an antitrust action against it and the defendant had filed a counterclaim alleging violation of the antitrust laws and asking for treble damages It did not matter the Court ruled that the equitable claims had been filed first and the law counterclaims involved allegations common to the equitable claims Subsequent jury trial of these issues would probably be precluded by collateral estoppel hence only under the most imperative circumstances which in view of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims

Carl Westman
Ernst Carl Westman February 20 1866  January 23 1936 was a Swedish architect and interior designer He was an early adopter of the National Romantic Style but turned later to the neoclassical style of the 1920s 

Carl Westman was born in Uppsala in 1866 He studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in 18851889 and then at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 18891892 in Stockholm In 1893 he married artist Elin Andersson and moved to the United States where he practiced with architect R L Daus in New York City in 18931895 

In 1895 he returned to Stockholm to work for architect Aron Johansson who at that time was the architect working with the new Parliament building 18951904 in Stockholm In 1897 Westman opened his own architect bureau He became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1912 and in 1916 he became the chief architect of the Swedish Royal Medical Board 

Carl Westman was one of the foremost advocators in Sweden for a return to the national characteristics in architecture He was one of the first Swedish architects who developed the new Nordic National Romantic Style a style which took the cultural and building precedents and merged them with ideas from the English Arts and Crafts movement to create a very distinct Swedish architecture often in brick and wood 

Carl Westmans Swedish General Medical Association building in Stockholm 19041906 was the first building built in the National Romantic Style with the Rhss Museum in Gothenburg 19101914 and Stockholm Court House 19111915 providing another two prominent examples The Stockholm Courthouse has striking similarities with the medieval Vadstena Castle and provides a dazzling sight in downtown Stockholm though the building proves quite inflexible for its purposes 

Later on Westman worked particularly as a hospital architect gradually adopting the classical style of the 1920s with noted examples being the Beckomberga Hospital 19271935 and the Karolinska Hospital 19351940 which was completed after his death Whereas the psychiatric hospital at Beckomberga was strictly symmetrically planned with massive buildings grouped in a fairly functional pattern the Karolinska hospital strives towards a more functional architecture where the symmetrical design was toned down

Carl Westman was also a parttime interior designer of furniture and utility supplies such as tiled stoves He died in Stockholm in 1936

Tuvia Tenenbom  born 1957 in Bnei Brak Israel is a theater director playwright author journalist essayist and the founding artistic director of the Jewish Theater of New York the only Englishspeaking Jewish theater in New York City Tenenbom was called the founder of a new form of Jewish theatre by the French Le Monde and a New Jew by the Israeli Maariv 
Tenenbom is also an academic having university degrees in mathematics computer science dramatic writing and literature

Tenenbom has written over sixteen plays for The Jewish Theater of New York widely recognized by American and European critics German newspaper Die Zeit described Tenenboms play The Last Virgin as more desperately needed in Germany than suspected The New York Times reviewing Father of the Angels called it irresistibly fascinating and Corriere della Sera reviewing Last Jew In Europe named Tenenbom One of the most iconoclastic and innovative of contemporary dramatists

Tenenbom writes for various newspapers and websites and his political articles cultural criticism and essays have appeared in media outlets including Die Zeit of Germany Corriere della Sera of Italy Yedioth Ahronot of Israel and Fox News Tuvia Tenenbom was also a political columnist for Zeit Online his column appeared every second week  Presently he is a frequent contributor for Die Zeit 

Tenenboms book I Sleep in Hitlers Room published by an imprint of The Jewish Theater of New York is a psychological travelogue through presentday Germany Described by the Israeli paper Haaretz as an alarming account of antiSemitism the book details the wide spread of modern antiSemitism in Europe Tuvia Tenenbom comes off as a Jewish Hunter S Thompson said Spengler of the Asia Times in his review of the book adding To understand Germans one has to learn their language and live with them  or read Tenenboms book Bruce Bawer reviewing it for PJ Media writes Its a book in a category all its own  deeply sobering depressing even in its observations of the darker side of Germany yet at the same time so chatty and engaging and laughoutloud funny that its hard to put down The book also received strong endorsement from the National Review which called it a tremendous book

In December 2012 a German translation of Tenenboms book titled Allein unter Deutschen Alone Among Germans published by Suhrkamp Verlag of Berlin became an instant bestseller on the Spiegel bestseller list Upon publication in Germany book critics differed widely in their opinions of the work Spiegels Wolfgang Hbel and Jakob Augstein were highly critical of the book Die Tageszeitung taz was extremely critical writing that Tenenboms book offered zero insight while Jungle World called the book a gem The GermanJewish journalist Henryk M Broder praised Tenenboms onesidedness comparing him to both Michael Moore and to Sacha Baron Cohens Borat German TV station WDR which Tenenbom accused in his book of assisting an antiSemitic group in Cologne dismissed the book as embarrassing or dumb Deutschlandfunk advised its listeners not to buy the book and encouraged those who had already bought it to bring it back to the bookstore Evelyn Finger of Die Zeit praised the book calling it courageous and describing its content as a Kamikaze ride of discovery into Germanys national character In Germanys Jewish weekly Jdische Allgemeine which is published by the Jewish community of Germany Hannes Stein endorsed Tenenboms book and findings This book contains the bitter nectar of the pure unfiltered truth

Tenenboms book Catch the Jew published by Gefen Publishing recounts the adventures of Tuvia Tenenbom who wanders around Israel of our time calling himself Tobi the German 

In the course of numerous interviews Tuvia extracts information sentiments hidden theories and delusional visions motivating the miscellany of peoples forming the presentday Holy Land The Wall Street Journal hailed the book writing Catch the Jew offers one of the more interesting portraits of Palestinian politics to have appeared in English and concluding that no reader of Catch the Jew can come away having failed to learn many new things about Israelis and Palestinians two peoples we talk about so much but understand so little 

In a starred review Publishers Weekly writes that Tenenboms riveting tale chock full of unbelievable and hilarious encounters is highly engaging and emotional eminently readable brutally honest and likely the most uncensored and eyeopening report readers will see

Orgasm song
Orgasm was the first release by drummer Yoshikis own record label Extasy Records Unusually the bands name X is written on the cover in Japanese as  All 1500 copies sold out and in his biography Yoshiki says an additional pressing of 2500 copies was scheduled but was cancelled as guitarist Jun and bassist Hikaru had left the band

The song is notoriously known for the obvious sexual themes presented within the lyrics Of particular notice is the fact that the track begins with heavy panting and ends with explosions seemingly to emulate sexual climax The title track as well as the selftitled X would later be rerecorded for the bands 1989 second album Blue Blood While Yoshiki is credited with the lyrics and music for both these songs on the single the Blue Blood recordings credit his alias Hitomi Shiratori for their lyrics instead

X has become a signature song of X Japan being performed at nearly all of their concerts Numerous times during a pause in a performance of the track a band member usually vocalist Toshi will yell We are and the audience responds with X before the musicians start the last leg of the song This was used as the title to the 2016 documentary film about the group We Are X

On November 21 1993 SME Records released  a short film based on the manga series X by Clamp and set to X Japans music It features a slideshow of the mangas artwork set to a medley of X Japans Silent Jealousy Kurenai and Endless Rain and a music video for the song X directed by Shigeyuki Hayashi
