The Gift Star Trek Voyager
The Gift is the second episode of the of the American science fiction television series  the 70th episode overall Set in the 24th century the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far from the rest of the Federation The episode marks the last appearance of Kes until the episode

After  USS Voyager still remains without working warp propulsion and is infested with Borg technology Seven of Nine the Borg drone saved from the destruction of her cube has her connection with the Borg collective severed She is now able to function as an individual but she is shocked by the change and still refers to herself in the first person plural Her body nevertheless starts to heal and reject Borg technology The Doctor decides that he should remove her Borg implants so she can recover

The Doctor hesitates to operate on a patient who refuses medical attention but Captain Janeway who believes that Seven of Nine is unable to make decisions for herself in her current state convinces him to do it During the operation she starts to have a seizure caused by an implant in her brain Kes uses her increasingly powerful telepathic abilities to disable the implant and stop the seizure

The Doctor removes as much of the technology as possible save for those that are too much part of her vital systems but Seven of Nine is upset by the result She is not used to being an individual and she repeatedly demands that she be returned to the Collective Janeway refuses and asks her to help with removing the Borg technology in Voyagers systems

Meanwhile Kes and Tuvok meditate Kes has learned to manipulate matter on a subatomic level and begins to see beyond even that

As Seven of Nine begins her work on repairs she is closely guarded by Harry Kim and a security guard While looking at the hardware Seven sees a transmitter and her Borg impulses are sparked into action by the stimulus She pushes Ensign Kim out of the room shuts the door and barricades herself in the room She accesses a subspace transmitter and tries to send a message to the Borg Kes senses that something is wrong and uses her abilities to send an electrical surge that stops Seven

Seven is held in the brig where she has a long talk with Janeway about her separation from the Collective Meanwhile Neelix and Kes talk about their past She tells him about her new powers and demonstrates them Neelix is hurt as the table they were sitting at starts to change The ships structural integrity begins to destabilize When Janeway and Tuvok enter the room they see Kes on the floor and her body changing  destabilizing at the subatomic level as Tuvok explains The Doctor is unable to explain this reaction he only knows that her powers must be suppressed or she might die

Seven of Nine unsuccessfully tries to break through the brigs forcefield Janeway comes inside her cell with information about her past Before assimilation she was a human girl named Annika Hansen The new information enrages her and her wish to return to the Borg remains unchanged

Kes and Janeway have their last talk and Kes is overcome by her powers warping her very surroundings She cannot control herself and becomes a danger to the ship She and Janeway agree she should leave the ship before it is destroyed Kes boards a shuttle and puts some distance between herself and Voyager

As her atomic structure destabilizes she contacts Voyager and tells them she is about to give them a gift As she vanishes Voyagers warp core begins to function at more than 120 capacity The ship hurtles through space ending up over 9500 light years away in a flash The crew realizes they are safely beyond Borg space and ten years closer to home With their friend Kes far away and on another plane of existence the crew try to accept Seven into their midst Reluctantly she accepts their help and is seen later with most of her Borg implants removed now wearing a bodysuit to conceal the remaining implants and having her blonde hair grown back contemplating her new appearance in closed thoughts

In 2017 Netflix announced that The Gift was among the top ten most rewatched Star Trek episodes on their streaming service excluding the first two episodes of each series

HexapodTelescope
The HexapodTelescope HPT is a located at Cerro Armazones Observatory in northern Chile The RitcheyChrtien reflecting telescope is notable for the design of telescope mount Instead of the typical mounting where the telescope moves on two rotating axes the mirror end of the telescope is supported by six extensible struts an arrangement known as a Stewart platform This configuration allows the telescope to move in all six spatial degrees of freedom and also provides strong structural integrity As a result the ratio of bearing pressure and its own weight is very high Furthermore the sixleg structure allows for a very precise positioning and repeatability The disadvantage of the system is that controlling and aiming a hexapodmounted telescope is much more complex than with conventional telescope mounts

The mounting was designed by of the Vertex in with astronomers of the Astronomy Institute of the Ruhr University Bochum AIRUB in Germany Led by Prof Rolf Chini the HPT was thoroughly tested at AIRUB In 2006 it was moved to its new location on Cerro Armazones Observatory in the Atacama Desert in Chile AIRUB in collaboration with the Astronomy Department of the Catholic University of the North UCN is developing an observatory there A new control building was built next to the HPT on the summit of Cerro Murphy a subsidiary peak of Cerro Armazones

Together with the Landessternwarte HeidelbergKnigstuhl AIRUB developed the Bochum Echelle Spectrograph for the Optical BESO for the HPT It is a copy of the Fiberfed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph FEROS operated by the European Southern Observatory

Jinzhou Operation
The Jinzhou Chinchow Operation was an operation in 1931 during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria which was a preliminary contributing factor to the outbreak of the Second SinoJapanese War in 1937

In late November 1931 Imperial Japanese Army commander in chief General Shigeru Honj dispatched 10000 soldiers in 13 armored trains escorted by a squadron of bombers in an advance on Jinzhou from Mukden This force advanced to within 30 kilometers of Chinchow when it received an order to withdraw The operation was cancelled by Japanese War Minister General Jir Minami due to the acceptance of modified form of a League of Nations proposal for a neutral zone to be established as a buffer zone between the Republic of China proper and Manchuria pending a future ChinaJapanese peace conference by the civilian government of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijir in Tokyo

However the two sides failed to reach a lasting agreement The Wakatsuki government soon fell and was replaced by a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai Further negotiations with the Kuomintang government failing the Japanese government approved an increase in the military forces in Manchuria In December the rest of the 20th Infantry Division along with the 38th Mixed Brigade of the 19th Infantry Division were sent into Manchuria from Korea while the 8th Mixed Brigade 10th Infantry Division was sent from Japan

Following the defeat of General Ma Zhanshan in Heilongjiang province and in anticipation of reinforcements a new Japanese offensive was launched in Manchuria on December 21 General Honjo insisted that his troops were moving out to clear the country of bandits and added that the Chinese evacuation of Chinchow was absolutely imperative Most of the bandits were actually the organizing AntiJapanese Volunteer Armies but some real bandits were also exploiting the chaos following the collapse of the Chinese government and its Northeastern Army following the Mukden Incident and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria

While the other Japanese forces and collaborationist Manchurian troops spread out from their bases along the South Manchurian Railway rail lines to clear the countryside from Mukden the Japanese headquarters in Manchuria the brigades of the 12th Infantry Division advanced southward in the night supported by squadrons of Japanese bombers to force the Chinese to evacuate Jinzhou

The Japanese estimated the Chinese at Jinzhou had 84000 defenders with 58 artillery pieces placed to support two separate systems of entrenchments defending the city The Chinese first defensive line 20 miles north of the city was a series of trenches aimed to stop the Japanese advance at the Taling River Bridge on the PeipingMukden Railway The Chinese had a second line of earthworks and entrenchments completely encircling Jinzhou to fall back on if the Japanese forces broke through the first line

Japanese Lieutenant General Jir Tamons troops cautiously advanced south from Mukden The temperature was 30 below zero and Japanese forces were camouflaged in white Japanese reconnaissance aircraft reported a force of at least 3000 Chinese bandits waiting to defend Panshan County Brushing aside these Chinese skirmishers in a series of minor clashes Tamon prepared to meet and crush the first serious Chinese resistance expected at Goubangzi 50 kilometers north of Jinzhou

By the evening of December 31 1931 the Japanese advance guard was fifteen kilometers from Jinzhou on the banks of the Taling river General Tamon halted briefly to bring up the rest of his 2nd Division for the final drive on Jinzhou The Japanese War Office announced in a radio broadcast The Battle of the Taling River setting up microphones behind the Japanese lines arranging an elaborate hookup to broadcast the sound of firing to Tokyo but then had to call off the broadcast when the Chinese retreated without giving combat

Japanese forces occupied Jinzhou on January 3 1932 with the local populace waving Japanese flags homemade during the night to appease the conquerors

On the Chinese side confusion reigned The old government of Chiang Kaishek at Nanjing had resigned and a new one under Premier Sun Fo had been formed Additionally Marshal Zhang Xueliangs defenders were in disorderly retreat toward the Great Wall leaving only a small garrison to protect the few government functionaries who remained behind At Nanjing Eugene Chen the new Kuomintang Foreign Minister asserted that his government had never ordered evacuation of Jinzhou but on the contrary had ordered Marshal Zhang repeatedly to stand his ground Nine Chinese generals in various parts of China denounced Premier Sun Fos new government blaming it for the humiliating loss of Jinzhou without a struggle

The day after the fall of Jinzhou the Imperial Japanese Army occupied Shanhaiguan thus completing its military control over south Manchuria
