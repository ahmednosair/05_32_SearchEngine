David Foster novelist
David Manning Foster born 15 May 1944 is an Australian novelist and scientist He has written a range of satires on the theme of the decline of Western civilization as well as producing short stories poetry essays and a number of radio plays

David Manning Foster was born on 15 May 1944 in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales Australia to George and Hazel ne Manning Foster vaudeville and radio performers who separated before his birth and spent his early years in Katoomba raised by his mother and maternal grandparents In 1950 Foster spent six months in Katoomba Hospital recovering from poliomyelitis a disease that left him with a slight limp His mother married a bank officer and Foster attended high schools in Sydney Fort Street High School Armidale Armidale High School and Orange Orange High School as the family moved from city to country towns At Orange High Foster began playing drums professionally in a jazz dance band

In 1961 Foster commenced a Arts degree at the University of Sydney in Sydney but he left studies after a year to work and travel A year thereafter in 1963 he return to the University to study chemistry at the University of Sydney School of Chemistry

Foster worked parttime as a musician and as an engineer at Marrickville Council while he completed his Bachelor of Science in Chemistry He was awarded the University Medal for Inorganic Chemistry in 1967 and moved to Canberra for a PhD in Biological Inorganic Chemistry at the Australian National University from which he graduated in 1970

At the end of this degree he went to Philadelphia Pennsylvania in the United States to pursue postdoctoral studies at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Pennsylvania

During this time he began to write his first novellas later published in North South West 1973 Back in Sydney in 1972 he worked as a Research Officer in the Department of Medicine University of Sydney before abandoning science for a career as a novelist Since then he has supported himself and his family by various work as a pool attendant musician postman truck driver martial arts instructor and trawler fisherman After the publication of North South West by Macmillan Foster was awarded an Australia Council for the Arts Fellowship

Fosters first collection of novellas was wellreceived and his first novel The Pure Land 1974 won the inaugural The Age Book of the Year prize The novel is strongly autobiographical as it traces the experiences of the young scientist Danny Harris in America and Australia At the end of the novel Danny has abandoned science and appears to be inventing the novel in which he is a character His grandfather Albert Manwaring has left his life as a photographer in Katoomba to seek success and finally spiritual purity in America Danny born in America reverses the journey to find a Pure Land in Australia The novel satirises both the grasping materialism of America and the backward colonialism of Australia This novel was followed by another collection of stories Escape to Reality 1977 which pursued Fosters interest in masculine irresponsibility and the paradoxes of science and art With a fellow scientist at the Australian National University called DK Lyall Des Kirk Foster published The Empathy Experiment 1977 a strange exploration of paranoia in the context of scientific experiments in empathy

A 1978 Marten Bequest enabled Foster to travel to Scotland to research Moonlite 1981 his acclaimed satire on colonialism which places the experiences of Scottish islanders during the clearances of the nineteenth century in paradoxical comparison with the colonising of Australia at the same time Plumbum 1983 uses Fosters experience in jazz bands to satirise the contemporary Western adulation of rock musicians contrasting this fervour with the various religions of Bangkok and India The Adventures of Christian Rosy Cross 1985 is a burlesque historical satire on the paradoxes of religious belief following the picaresque adventures of Christian as he searches for the philosophers stone Dog Rock a Postal Pastoral 1985 offers a more benign comedy as Foster examines the trivia of an Australian country town like Bundanoon A second Dog Rock novel The Pale Blue Crochet Coathanger Cover 1988 continues this nostalgic view of a disappearing rural life with particular reference to the misuse of animals and in 2012 Foster published a third Dog Rock novel Man of Letters Testostero 1987 inspired by a residence in Venice in 1984 uses the convention of the separated twins to satirise the cultural differences between Britain and Australia with a third possibility represented by Italy Among its many allusions and parodies the novel invokes the traditions of Carnivale and Carlo Goldonis playThe Venetian Twins

After the Australian Bicentennial celebrations of 1988 Foster published his own satire of the state of contemporary Australia in Mates of Mars 1991 The novel follows a group of martial arts enthusiasts as they travel from Sydney to the Northern Territory and encounter a spiritualism that challenges their various beliefs and attitudes The characters represent a multicultural Australia and demonstrate the novels premise that Australians are not just members of the internal proletariat ofWestern Christian Civilisation  a civilisation now decrepit that can never take Colonials seriously but also in certain key aspects chiefly but not exclusively economic barbarian members of the external proletariat of the Sinic Mahayana Buddhist Civilisation in its Westernised JapaneseKoreanColonial Chinese branch on the southernmost march of that civilisation

Foster used the support of an Australian government Creative Fellowship awarded in 1991 a Keating award to research his monumental The Glade Within the Grove 1996 Narrated by the postman of Dog Rock DArcy DOliveres this novel examines the destruction of the native forests of Australia and the decline of Christianity in the context of preChristian religious beliefs Set mainly in the revolutionary year of 1968 the novel speculates about a group of hippies who set up a commune in the South Eastern forests of Australia The novels accompanying poemThe Ballad of Erinungerah claims to be the work of a child of the commune and describes the visit of the goddess Brigid and her demand that the men castrate themselves The novel celebrates the forests in lyrical descriptions satirises the stupidity of the communards and translates snatches of classic texts into Australian vernacular It is celebratory satirical and elegiac Later Foster published under his own name an essay On Castration in Heat magazine that incorporated part of the novel as it argued that male sexuality is a destructive force that needs to be controlled This obsession is evident in all Fosters work after Mates of Mars His novel In the New Country offers a comic and despairing view of the decline of rural life in Australia comparing it to the corresponding decline of spirituality in the Old Country of Ireland The Land Where Stories End is a fairytale about a woodcutter in Ireland who goes on an impossible quest for spiritual purity 

In 2009 Foster published Sons of the Rumour his most ambitious and original novel to date Modelled on the structure of the One Thousand and One Nights it changes the storytellers role from Shahrazad to a group of men travelling through the 7th century city of Merv Richard Burtons Arabian Nights are transformed into Iranian days Foster creates a comic structure for the stories with his rather Australian bickering couple the Shah and Shahrazad but the stories are imaginative adventures sometimes puzzling sometimes grotesque and often wondrous For example The Mine in the Moon imagines a world without women where boys grow up without maternal comfort The Tears of the Fish describes an orgy and castration ritual The Gilt Felt Yurt measures the loss of freedom in the creation of civilization and settlement In the course of the stories the Shah undergoes an education in spiritualism and sexual understanding A final section of the novel moves to the present day where a modern man undergoes a visionary experience in Ireland Reviewing the novel for Australian Book Review James Ley concluded There is simply no one remotely like him in contemporary Australian fiction He is so far ahead of everyone else that its not funny Except that it is funnyvery very funny

In 1964 Foster married his Orange High girlfriend Robin Bowers with whom he would have three children Samantha b 1968 Natalie b 1969 and Seth b 1973

In 1974 he left his wife and family to live with Gerda Busch the singer in the Canberra jazz band where he played drums They moved to the country town of Bundanoon where they married and had three children Antigone b 1975 Levi b 1976 and Zoe Foster Blake b 1980 Foster worked as a postman at Bundanoon for many years and his Dog Rock novels provide a comic version of the town

His daughter Zoe is also a writer and is married to comedian Hamish Blake

Plcido de Castro Acre
Plcido de Castro is a municipality located in the east of the Brazilian state of Acre on the border with Bolivia

The municipal seat is on the left bank of the Abun River which defines the boundary between Brazil and Bolivia
It is from Rio Branco by road or as the crow flies accessible to weekend tourists from the city via the AC40 highway
It has an area of  and is the 19th largest in area in Acre
The municipality is bounded to the north and northwest by the municipality of Senador Guiomard to the east by the municipality of Acrelndia to the south by Bolivia and to the west by the municipality of Capixaba
The municipality contains the Plcido de Castro Ecological Park a municipal conservation area that contains 113 genera of trees
An area that held large trees such as Brazil nut rubber cocoa and mahogany was destroyed by fire in 2005

The surrounding area has several large ancient earthworks termed geoglifos by regional archaeologists
An example is clearly visible in aerial photography at 

In the early 20th century the region of the present municipality was a place where fugitives from the law took refuge
Jos Plcido de Castro who was prefect of the Alto Acre department in 190607 recommended the need for a settlement to stabilise the situation
In 1922 a trading post was established serving extractors of nuts and rubber in the Abun River basin
The post was in a rubber tappers settlement named Pacatuba on the So Gabriel rubber estate which was soon renamed after Plcido de Castro a hero of the Acre War

The Plcido de Castro District is shown as part of the Rio Branco municipality in the divisions of 31 December 1936 and 1 July 1960
The town did not develop until the 1940s and 1950s with the opening of the present road that links the city of Rio Branco to the towns of Quinari Senador Guiomard and Plcido de Castro
The municipality of Plcido de Castro was created on 10 March 1963

The 2010 census gave the population as 17209 of which 8999 were men and 8210 women 12384 were literate
6787 were Roman Catholic and 5134 were Evangelical Christians
The Human Development Index as of 2010 was 0622
In 2015 there were 3260 elementary school pupils and 776 secondary school pupils
Estimated population as of 2016 was 18159

The municipality is the 8th largest in Acre by population with a population density of 887 inhabitants per square kilometre
The local economy is based on beef and dairy cattle saw mills furniture manufacture tourism agriculture and extraction particularly Brazil nuts
The neighbouring Bolivian village of Vila Montevidu had a free trade zone for imported goods that was much visited by Brazilians
The village was burned in a major fire in 2007 and was rebuilt on a nearby site with the new name of Vila Evo Morales
The name honours President Evo Morales of Bolivia who sent aid for reconstruction and was the first Bolivian president to visit the village

Porto Acre
Porto Acre is a municipality located in the northeast of the Brazilian state of Acre 
The economy is mainly based on agriculture As of 2010 the municipality had a population of 14806

Porto Acre is in the eastern part of the state of Acre to the north of the BR364 highway and Rio Branco
The municipal seat is on the left west bank of the Acre River a tributary of the Purus River that runs through the municipality from south to north
The town can be accessed by boat along the Acre River or by land along the AC010 highway which runs north from Rio Branco for 
The distance from Rio Branco as the crow flies is 
Porto Acre is limited to the north by the state of Amazonas to the west and south by the municipality of Bujari to the south by Rio Branco and to the east by the municipality of Senador Guiomard

In 1899 Acre belonged to Bolivia and the present municipal seat was named Puerto Alonso
That year Luis Glvez Rodrguez de Arias expelled the Bolivians and declared the Independent State of Acre
He renamed Puerto Alonso to Cidade do Acre and made it the headquarters of the new state
The state created a flag minted its own currency drafted a constitution appointed ministers and formed an army
However Galves was deposed and arrested after a few months and the Bolivians regained control

At the start of 1902 Jos Plcido de Castro accepted an invitation to lead a revolt against Bolivia
He took a boat up the Acre river ostensibly to conduct land surveys in the south but in practice carrying arms and ammunition 
He stopped off briefly in Puerto Alonso to meet the Bolivian governor Lino Romero and evaluate his future opponent
In the south he organised the rubber tappers and other inhabitants for the revolt
He then returned to Brazil bypassing Puerto Alonso to avoid alerting the Bolivians

Plcido captured Xapuri on 6 August 1902 and next day proclaimed that Acre was independent
On 14 October 1902 the rebels captured some of the outer defences of Puerto Alonso and the armed Bolivian launch Rio Afua which they renamed the Independencia
Plcido de Castro surrounded the town on 8 January 1903 and launched an attack on 15 January 1903 that soon petered out
His men started to dig zigzag trenches to the Bolivian lines
Eventually with his forces exhausted and almost out of ammunition Romero surrendered on 24 January 1903

The municipality of Porto Acre gained autonomy on 28 April 1992 when it was separated from the Rio Branco municipality
The first mayor and councillors took office of 1 January 1993
According to the 2010 census the municipality has a population of 14806
The municipality has an area of and a population density of 571 inhabitants per square kilometre
The local football team is Valncia Porto Acre

Porto Acres economy is based on extraction of rubber Brazil nut and wood processing smallscale livestock horticultural products and general commerce
The Acre River is still used for movement of goods and people
During the dry season its fertile banks are used to grow watermelon banana vegetables cassava and other food crops
There are nine settlement projects with a total area of  or 441 of the municipal area

Australian Film Commission
The Australian Film Commission AFC was an Australian government agency with a mandate to promote the creation and distribution of films in Australia as well as to preserve the countrys film history It also had a production arm responsible for production and commissioning of films for the Australian Government It was established by the Whitlam Government in 1975 as the successor to the Australian Film Development Corporation set up by the Gorton Government The AFC had offices in Sydney Melbourne Canberra and Brisbane

The AFC was funded in part by the national government and in part from its return on investments in film production as well as interest on film development loans It financially assisted film and television production and also produced films generally intended for government purposes through its production arm Film Australiapreviously known as the Commonwealth Film Unit A Film Australia feature film for children Let the Balloon Go was released in 1976

Conditional event algebra
A conditional event algebra CEA is an algebraic structure whose domain consists of logical objects described by statements of forms such as If A then B B given A and B in case A Unlike the standard Boolean algebra of events a CEA allows the defining of a probability function P which satisfies the equation PIf A then B  PA and B  PA over a usefully broad range of conditions

In standard probability theory one begins with a set  of outcomes or in alternate terminology a set of possible worlds and a set F of some not necessarily all subsets of  such that F is closed under the countably infinite versions of the operations of basic set theory union  intersection  and complementation   A member of F is called an event or alternatively a proposition and F the set of events is the domain of the algebra  is necessarily a member of F namely the trivial event Some outcome occurs

A probability function P assigns to each member of F a real number in such a way as to satisfy the following axioms

It follows that PE is always less than or equal to 1 The probability function is the basis for statements like PA  B  073 which means The probability that A but not B is 73

The statement The probability that if A then B is 24 means put intuitively that event B occurs in 24 of the outcomes where event A occurs The standard formal expression of this is PBA  024 where the conditional probability PBA equals by definition PA  B  PA

It is tempting to write instead PA  B  024 where A  B is the conditional event If A then B That is given events A and B one might posit an event A  B such that PA  B could be counted on to equal PBA One benefit of being able to refer to conditional events would be the opportunity to nest conditional event descriptions within larger constructions Then for instance one could write PA  B  C  051 meaning The probability that either A or else if B then C is 51

Unfortunately philosopher David Lewis showed that in orthodox probability theory only certain trivial Boolean algebras with very few elements contain for any given A and B an event X such that PX  PBA is true for any probability function P Later extended by others this result stands as a major obstacle to any talk about logical objects that can be the bearers of conditional probabilities

The classification of an algebra makes no reference to the nature of the objects in the domain being entirely a matter of the formal behavior of the operations on the domain However investigation of the properties of an algebra often proceeds by assuming the objects to have a particular character Thus the canonical Boolean algebra is as described above an algebra of subsets of a universe set What Lewis in effect showed is what can and cannot be done with an algebra whose members behave like members of such a set of subsets

Conditional event algebras circumvent the obstacle identified by Lewis by using a nonstandard domain of objects Instead of being members of a set F of subsets of some universe set  the canonical objects are normally higherlevel constructions of members of F The most natural construction and historically the first uses ordered pairs of members of F Other constructions use sets of members of F or infinite sequences of members of F

Specific types of CEA include the following listed in order of discovery

CEAs differ in their formal properties so that they cannot be considered a single axiomatically characterized class of algebra GoodmanNguyenvan Frassen algebras for example are Boolean while Calabrese algebras are nondistributive The latter however support the intuitively appealing identity A  B  C  A  B  C while the former do not

Takeda Skaku
Born in the Aizu domain Fukushima Prefecture Skaku grew up in the time of the Boshin War The second son of Takeda Skichi a samurai of the Takeda clan who worked his farm and taught at a local school in a Buddhist temple His mother Tomi Kurokochi was a daughter of Dengoro Kurokochi a Yari and Kenjutsu master It is believed that Skaku received his first martial arts training from his father who had a dojo on their property
Skichi was apparently expert in the use of both sword and spear and had once been a sumo wrestler of ozeki rank It is believed that Skaku was exposed to the teachings of Hzinry Takadaha and Onoha Ittry schools of spear and swordsmanship respectively

Skaku then left to go on a period of austere training where he travelled fought and trained at the schools of many teachers a not uncommon practise of the time Reputedly Skaku spent some time as a livein student of Kenkichi Sakakibara headmaster of the Jikishinkagery and considered to be one of the most famous and skilled swordsmen of the era

With the outlawing of the samurai class and the prohibition against carrying swords Haitrei Edict apparentally Sokaku decided to emphasize the empty handed jujutsu oriented techniques of his ancestors art These apparently were oshikiuchi or secret teachings of the Aizu clan up to that point These along with other skills he had acquired were combined to create an art which he christened first Daitry jjutsu and later Daitry Aikijjutsu

In about 1875 rumor reached Skaku that Saig Takamori had launched his rebellion in Satsuma against the forces of the new Meiji government He decided immediately that he would go to lend his support He made it as far as Kyushu but was unable to reach his destination so he returned to Osaka where he spent the next ten years as a guest in the Kyshin Meichiry dojo of swordsman Momonoi Shunzo

Skaku lived a somewhat itinerant life travelling the length and breadth of the country giving seminars in martial arts to military officers police officers and martial arts enthusiasts often of high social standing He left extensive records of those he taught in his eimeiroku and shareikoku  attendance and fee ledgers

Taking over the role of headmaster of the art was Skakus son Tokimune Takeda who established the Daitokan school in Hokkaid to promote the art and rechristened it Daitry Aiki Bud Tokimune is said to have contributed much of the teaching system which exists for the art today naming and classifying the techniques and further simplifying the weapons component of the system He emphasized the Ona ha Ittoryu portion of the weapons curriculum over other elements that Skaku taught to some advanced students

Sokakus highest ranking students were Hisa Takuma and Masao Tonedate both high executives of the Asahi newspaper in Osaka whose own students established the Takumakai and the Daibukan

Other important students of Skakus were Yukiyoshi Sagawa who some believe was the most talented of his early students Kodo Horikawa Kotaro whose students established the Kodokai and the Roppokai Ktar Yoshida Hosaku Matsuda and Tomekichi Yamamoto

His most famous student was the founder of aikido Morihei Ueshiba and it is the popularity of this modern martial arts form that is responsible for much of the interest in Daitry today

Hosaku Matsuda was taught by Skaku who in turn taught Yoshiji Okuyama who in turn founded the Hakkry Jujutsu school Okuyama taught Michiomi Nakano who later as Dshin S founder of Nippon Shorinji Kempo Choi YongSool the founder of Hapkido was adopted by Sokaku and trained with him as well

The influence of the teachings of Sokaku Takeda are readily discernible in the physical techniques of aikido Hakko Ryu Nippon Shorinji Kempo hapkido and judos goshin jutsu selfdefense kata via Kenji Tomiki today

Humanistic coefficient
A humanistic coefficient  is a conceptual object methodological principle or method of conducting social research wherein data analysis stresses the perceived import of analyzed experiences to their participants The term was coined by Polish sociologist Florian Znaniecki

Znaniecki coined the term in Polish in his Wstp do socjologii Introduction to Sociology 1922 and translated it into English as humanistic coefficient in his book The ObjectMatter of Sociology 1927

Grossly and simply speaking the humanistic coefficient is the difference between trying to describe or explain social facts as if they were purely physical phenomena or doing it instead by taking into account the culture of the folk or milieu in which those facts happen

In Znanieckis own words an observer of cultural life can understand the data observed only if taken with the humanistic coefficient only if he does not limit his observation to his own direct experience of the data but reconstructs the experience and the data in the social context of the people involved Elsewhere he wrote This essential character of cultural data we call the humanistic coefficient because such data as objects of the students theoretic reflection already belong to somebodys elses experience and are such as this active experience makes them

Piotr Sztompka defines the humanistic coefficient as a connection that exists between each social fact and actions and experiences of particular individuals and the resulting need for those facts to be studied from specific perspective that requires the research to place him or herself in the position of those individuals Elbieta Haas in turn defines it as the notion of the human collectives constructing and reconstructing of reality thus related to the concept of social constructionist

According to the concept of the humanistic coefficient all social facts are created by social actors and can only be understood from their perspective No social facts can exist without connection to some individuals although that connection does not have to necessarily be consciously perceived Thus the sociologist should study reality by trying to understand how others see the world not as an independent observer objectively in other words the scientist needs to understand the world of the subject Ken Plummer puts it curtly as the object of study is always linked to somebodys human meanings

While some have criticized the humanistic coefficient approach as too close to subjectivism Znaniecki himself saw is as antisubjectivist he noted that social facts like cultural systems can exist even if nobody perceives their existence He was also critical of any value coming from personal subjective observations arguing that such observations have value only if they can be objectively described Both natural and social sciences operate within the bounds of the humanistic coefficient but the natural sciences may abstract the pheomena they analyze from it while the social sciences are methodologically obliged to account for it Thus Znaniecki argued that the difference between natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences but in the subject of what is being studied for Znaniecki natural sciences studied things and social sciences  cultural values He saw sociology as a nomothetic science that should be able to use a similar methodology as natural sciences

The humanistic coefficient concerns the ontology of culture but it also has an epistemological aspect as it describes how sociological concepts should be constructed in an environment where social facts investigated by the researchers can be accessed only through experiences and actions of the subjects he or she observes

The humanistic coefficient is a major element in the sociological theory of Znaniecki

Xapuri
Xapuri  is a municipality located in the southeast of the Brazilian state of Acre 
It was the scene of an early bloodless victory during the war to make Acre independent of Bolivia The town is known as the birthplace of the rubber tapper Dr Adib Domingos Jatene and the environmentalist Chico Mendes

Xapuri is at the point where the Xapuri River meets the Acre River
Its name is said to come from the Indian word Chapury meaning river meeting
Another explanation is that its name comes from the indigenous tribe of Xapury people
The town is about northwest of the BR317 highway which leads from Rio Branco to the east to Brasilia to the west It has broad streets and wooden houses
The area of the municipality is 
It is 12th largest in area in Acre
It is bounded by the municipality of Sena Madureira to the west Rio Branco to the north Capixaba to the east Epitaciolndia to the south and Brasilia to the southwest

The municipality contains part of the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve a sustainable use environmental unit created in 1990
The reserve is fairly well maintained apart from a few locations of deforestation but its surroundings are quite deforested compromising its buffer zone

Xapuri was born in 1883 shortly after Volta da Empreza todays Rio Branco was founded
The first Europeans came to the region in the first rubber boom a period of uncontrolled land grabbing and extraction of forest resources
The village of Xapuri became one of Acres main rubber trading posts and the region was an important producer of rubber and Brazil nuts
Until the Acre War of 190203 it was part of Bolivia although most of the new colonists were Brazilian
At the time of the Acre War the Bolivians called the post Mariscal Sucre

At the start of 1902 Jos Plcido de Castro accepted an invitation to lead a revolt against Bolivia
Although he argued for immediately attacking the garrison of 230 troops at Puerto Alonso now Porto Acre Plcido de Castro was persuaded to first take the outpost at Xapuri
He entered Xapuri with 33 men in the early morning of 6 August 1902 and captured the sleeping garrison without spilling blood
On 7 August 1902 he issued a manifesto proclaiming that Acre was independent
After further fighting the last Bolivian forces surrender at what is now Porto Acre on 24 January 1903

The village of Xapuri was officially elevated to the status of a town on 22 March 1904 by the prefect of Alto Acre Colonel Augusto da Cunha Matos
On 22 March 1905 it was elevated to the status of city by the interim prefect Captain Odilon Pratagi Brasiliense
Xapuri was officially made a municipality on 23 October 1912
Infrastructure was soon built including trading houses and schools
For many years Xapuri was known as the Little Princess of Acre Princesinha do Acre due to its great wealth from rubber

The city became famous after the 1988 assassination of the rubber tapper and environmentalist Chico Mendes who was born in Xapuri
His house has been preserved as one of the attractions of the town

The municipality of Xapuri has the 9th largest population in Acre
As of 2010 the population was 16091
The estimated population in 2016 was 17608
The population density of 2010 was 301 people per square kilometre

The town is an important Acre tourist destination for its monuments to the Acre War and the house of Chico Mendes and has an ecolodge at the Seringal Waterfall 
Apart from cattle ranching and subsistence farming there is a condom factory wood flooring factory and furniture workshops
There are several settlement projects for extraction of nuts and rubber subsistence agriculture and forestry
The people also raise livestock hunt and fish
The Xapuri I and II projects are trying to bring back extractors and farmers who had moved to the city and to promote recovery of areas of pasturage and slashandburn agriculture by replanting fruit trees and timber trees

Highpower field
A highpower field HPF when used in relation to microscopy references the area visible under the maximum magnification power of the objective being used Often this represents a 400fold magnification when referenced in scientific papers

The area provides a reference unit for example in reference ranges for urine tests

Used for grading of soft tissue tumors Grading usually on a scale of I to III is based
on the degree of differentiation the average number of
mitoses per highpower field cellularity pleomorphism

Volkspele
Volkspele is a South African folk dance tradition

Directly translated Volkspele means folkgames and can be translated to folkdance Folkdance was the brainchild of South African Dr SH Pellisier who was visiting Sweden in 1915 with a friend to become more proficient in carpentry After finishing their days work they met with other young people in their respective countries national dress to practise their folksinging and dancing The South Africans were the only ones left out as they did not have any traditional dances

Back in South Africa Pellisier translated four Swedish dances and taught them to pupils at the Afrikaans High School in Boshof where he was Deputy Headmaster During a Sunday School picnic on the farm Vuisfontein near Boshof on 22 February 1914 they performed the dances for the first time The picnic games became known as volkspele

With the help of the Reddingsdaadbond an organisation which was established to assist poor Afrikaners after the Anglo Boer War groups of dancers called laers were established throughout the country

Gettogethers called saamtrekke are usually organised where all the laers get together to sing and do folkdancing The folkdancers also present displays and have courses on different levels seniors people out of school and juniors learners in school for either a weekend or longer During the June school holidays there are also courses for grade 57 pupils known as the Judith Pellissierweek  named after the wife of Dr Pellissier grade 89 pupils known as the Vormingsweek  Formative and for grade 1012 pupils known as the Pellisierweek From time to time there are overseas tours or a folkdance group or two will tour with South African folkdancers in South Africa giving displays at various towns At these saamtrekke displays tours and courses the dress volkspeledrag is as the photos below show

Tours have been conducted to Europe Namibia The United States and Turkey with groups from Italy Germany Belgium and others touring South Africa

The dress originated from the formal dress the pioneers or Voortrekkers wore It is called national dress as in the European countries All folkdancers in South Africa must use the same style with only the colours differing Each laer has its own colours for the ladies dresses as well as for the mens waistcoats  these are embroidered with indigenous flower designs

Goldies theorem
In mathematics Goldies theorem is a basic structural result in ring theory proved by Alfred Goldie during the 1950s What is now termed a right Goldie ring is a ring R that has finite uniform dimension finite rank as a right module over itself and satisfies the ascending chain condition on right annihilators of subsets of R 

Goldies theorem states that the semiprime right Goldie rings are precisely those that have a semisimple Artinian right classical ring of quotients The structure of this ring of quotients is then completely determined by the ArtinWedderburn theorem

In particular Goldies theorem applies to semiprime right Noetherian rings since by definition right Noetherian rings have the ascending chain condition on all right ideals This is sufficient to guarantee that a rightNoetherian ring is right Goldie The converse does not hold every right Ore domain is a right Goldie domain and hence so is every commutative integral domain

A consequence of Goldies theorem again due to Goldie is that every semiprime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of prime principal right ideal rings Every prime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a matrix ring over a right Ore domain

Khao Phing Kan
Khao Phing Kan   or Ko Khao Phing Kan   is an island in Thailand in Phang Nga Bay northeast of Phuket The islands are limestone karst towers and are a part of Ao Phang Nga National Park

About from the shores of Khao Phing Kan lies a tall islet called Ko Ta Pu   or Ko Tapu   Since 1974 when they were featured in the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun Khao Phing Kan and Ko Ta Pu have been popularly called James Bond Island

Khao Phing Kan means hills leaning against each other in Thai reflecting the connected nature of the islands Ko Ta Pu can be literally translated as crabs eye island and Ko Tapu can be translated as nail or spike island reflecting its shape With ko  meaning island and khao  meaning hill the terms ko khao and Ko Khao are frequently interchanged in the naming of the islands After appearing in the 1974 James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun Khao Phing Kan and sometimes Ko Ta Pu became widely referred to as James Bond Island especially in tourist guides and their original names are rarely used by locals

Before 1974 the island was a rarely visited indigenous area However it was chosen as one of the locations for the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun as the hideout for Bonds antagonist Francisco Scaramanga After the movie release it turned into a popular tourist destination Popularity and increased tourism left Khao Phing Kan with substantial litter

In 1981 the island became the most famous part of the newly established Ao Phang Nga Marine National Park Since 1998 it is forbidden for tourist boats to approach Ko Ta Pu This measure aims to stop erosion of the limestone rocks on and near the islet that might eventually result in the islands collapse

Khao Phing Kan consists of two forestcovered islands with steep shores They lie in the northwestern part of Phang Nga Bay from the mainland amid a group of a dozen of other islands Its western part is about in diameter whereas the eastern part is about long and wide and is elongated northwards The island has a few caves and two sandy beaches in the southwest and between the twin islands The former hosts the government office where every visitor has to pay a tax The latter is used as the port for the tourist boats arriving from the mainland and has several souvenir shops selling items like coral and shells and plasticencased butterflies scorpions and spiders Beaches and caves are regularly flooded with the tides which have an amplitude of  so access to some caves is only possible during low tide The Thai name for Khao Phing Kan reflects the particular shape of the island which appears as if a flat limestone cliff tumbled sideways and leaned on a similar rock in the centre of the island

Waters around the island are only few metres deep and are palegreen in colour The bottom is covered with silt brought to the Phang Nga Bay by several rivers from the north

Ko Ta Pu is a limestone rock about tall with the diameter increasing from about near the water level to about at the top It lies about to the west from the northern part of Khao Phing Kan

A local legend explains the formation of Ko Ta Pu as follows Once upon a time there lived a fisherman who used to bring home many fish every time he went to the sea However one day he could not catch any fish despite many attempts and only picked up a nail with his net He kept throwing the nail back into the sea and catching it again Furious he took his sword and cut the nail in half with all his strength Upon impact one half of the nail jumped up and speared into the sea forming Ko Ta Pu

A scientific version of the Ko Ta Pu formation says that in the Permian period the area was a barrier reef Then upon tectonic movements it ruptured and its parts were dispersed over the area and flooded by the rising ocean Wind waves water currents and tides gradually eroded the islands thus formed sometimes producing peculiar shapes such as Ko Ta Pu Tiderelated erosion is visible at the bottom
of the rock

In the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun Francisco Scaramanga describes Ko Ta Pu as a mushroomshaped rock which houses two large solar panels that come up on top of Ko Ta Pu and lock on to the Sun

Ko Ta Pu is also featured in another James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies identified as in Vietnam and in the Italian film Quo Vado identified as in the Philippines

AiFak
AiFak  is a 2004 Thai drama film It is based on the SEA Write Awardwinning novel by Chart Korbjitti Khamphiphaksa The Judgment also the Englishlanguage title for the film

A young man Fak is a revered novice Buddhist monk and the entire village has turned out to the local temple to hear him preach a sermon Faks talk is interrupted a coughing fit by his widower father though and Fak struggles to maintain his focus Fak then decides he must put aside his aspirations for monkhood to take care of his father Then he is conscripted by lottery into the army He hopes that when he completes his national service he will return to the village be ordained as a monk and devote his life to religion

On his return home from the army the bus to his village breaks down During the stop Fak steps over to the side of the road near a lotus pond to urinate There among the lotus he sees a beautiful woman bathing fully clothed as is customary in Thailand Fak zips up and eventually arrives at home where he finds his father in a very happy state His fathers reason for being so happy is that he has remarried Faks stepmother then appears from behind a mosquito net its the woman from the lotus pond Her name is Somsong and though she is sweet and devoted there is something clearly wrong with her perhaps some type of mental illness

Though there are happy times with Fak joining his father at work as a janitor for the local school his reunion with his father is shortlived after his father becomes ill and dies Because Fak made a promise to his father that he would look after his stepmother Faks goal of returning to the monkhood must again be put aside

Though Fak is well liked in the village the villagers do not like Somsong and have labeled her crazy And after Faks fathers death the villagers start to treat Fak differently they believe he is having an affair with his stepmother Fak at first ignores the gossip but it becomes harder and harder to deny because of Somsongs behavior On one occasion during a likay performance at a village fair Fak is accosted by Somsong after she sees Fak talking with a young woman Somsong is suffering from delusions that she and Fak are married and she is jealous Somsong also has the unfortunate habit of shedding her clothes and running naked in public or simply lifting her dress and exposing herself During one of these episodes some villagers happen upon Fak just as hes chased the nude Somsong down and is attempting to cover her up But what the villagers think they are witnessing is Fak having sex with his stepmother Fak has been judged

Fak has taken his fathers old job as school janitor One day a dog thats thought to be rabid wanders onto the school grounds Fak is given the job of killing it He grabs a hoe and uses it to strike the animal hitting it with a glancing blow that only injures it and makes it angrier Fak eventually finishes the snarling dog off but it is a bloody task For a brief moment Fak is seen as a hero by the students and faculty and he feels a bit better about himself

Fak must prepare for his fathers cremation He invites the schools headmaster the village headman and others He orders 50 sandalwood blossoms for attendees to place on the burning casket But no one shows up for the ceremony except for the monks he engaged to chant over his father and the local undertaker

Fak makes friends with the undertaker a lowly person who is not well liked by the superstitious villagers because they believe he is unclean Even Fak didnt particularly like the man but after Fak tells him that he has never had sexual relations with Somsong the man believes him

After the cremation rite the undertaker offers Fak some rice whiskey Fak at first doesnt like the taste or the way it makes him feel But he has a few more drinks and starts enjoy himself Looking for relief from the pressure of taking care of his mentally ill stepmother and the harsh judgment of the villagers Fak turns to the bottle and becomes an alcoholic His downward spiral continues until he has angered the villagers and they turn on him and beat him leaving him to be assisted home by Somsong

Defending champion and number two seed John Part suffered a surprise third round defeat to Mark Dudbridge his first match of the 2004 campaign

The final became only the second ever and first PDC world final to go to a sudden death leg The first time it happened was when Phil Taylor beat Mike Gregory in the 1992 final Taylor was again involved and came out victorious against Kevin Painter However he had to fight from 41 down to win his 11th world title

The two losing semifinalists came from different ends of darts experience Fiftysixyearold Bob Anderson a World Champion 16 years earlier lost to Painter and Wayne Mardle was making his first PDC World Championship semifinal appearance Mardle lost to Taylor for the second year running following a third round defeat as an unseeded player in 2003

To accommodate the change in the number of entries into the competition to 48 the format of the World Championship was again changed 16 qualifiers would contest the first round with the eight winners going through to the second round to meet players ranked between 25 and 32 inclusive in the PDC These eight winners would go through to join the top 24 in the third round where the tournament proceeded from the last 32 to the Final

All eight first round matches would take place on the first day of the tournament as it opened up in Purfleet In the openIng match Richie Buckle showed excellent form in eliminated Jan van der Rassel 31 with an 8715 average Van der Rassel a tough competitor lost two sets by 32 so it could have been a totally different story Next man through was Erik Clarys a Belgian known for success at Lakeside he dispatched Dan Lauby 30 Lauby only averaging 63 and able to win two legs in the contest  In the afternoon there were also wins for Wayne Atwood 30 and Colin McGarry 30 over Toru Sano and Rory Orvis respectively

Arguably the best match of the first round came in the opening game in the evening Robbie Widdows known for his performances in the BDO played Henry ONeill in a five set thriller ONeill taking the fourth 32 and holding Widdows to 44 in the decider Experience told and Robbie took the final two legs to sneak through 64 in the final set Englands Simon Whatley the next man for Widdows

To follow that up we saw a superb recovery from Scotlands Alex Mackay against Barry Jouannet of Australia Jouannet dominating proceedings took the first two sets 32 31 to go twonil up McKay replied with two 31 sets of his own to level the match up at 22 and to go favourite Jouannet recovered from the setback however to go 22 in the decider and into the tiebreak However Mackays 8538 average would be enough to get him through 32 To finish the day Steve Smith and Steve Maish would go through beating Norman Madhoo Guyanas first ever dart qualifier 31 and Tony Payne known for his Embassy attempts 30 respectively

Players ranked 2532 in the World rankings came into play as the tournament began its second round Matches were still over best of 5 sets The afternoon session brought a succession of 30 scorelines for the qualifiers from yesterday Richie Buckle defeated Steve Brown and lost just four legs against the man who had been in the SemiFinals here a decade earlier Colin McGarry knocked out Mark Holden who would throw his darts away and retire after this 30 loss however Holden was suffering from Dartitis Wayne Atwood was at his best in eliminating Mick Manning 30 Manning lost the first two sets 30 before putting up resistance in the third set before losing it 32 Atwood averaged 8793 and moves into a match against two time finalist and number 3 seed Peter Manley in the third round The final match saw Mark Walsh knocked out 30 by Erik Clarys

The evening session followed the form book more however there was the prospect of lightning striking twice in the same place Alex McKay again recovered from behind to level the match at 22 with Lionel Sams The match of the round it proved to be as the pair served up a memorable contest Each of the opening 4 sets went 32 making the tiebreak inevitable Sams edged the fifth set by five legs to three to go through with an 8583 average Following this he proposed to his girlfriend Caroline live on Sky

Mark Dudbridge would go through 30 against Steven Smith however this didnt tell the full story as Smith took five legs and Mark took two deciding legs to go 20 up and the third by 31 to book his date against John Part the defending champion in the third round Simon Whatley would start off a great week for him in a 31 win over Robbie Widdows who didnt score as heavily as he had in the first round In the final match Big Cliff Lazarenko went out 31 to Steve Maish

7 third round matches as the top players entered the fray Matches had now been extended to the best of 7 sets so the players require 4 sets to go through

The 1st match saw to players with an excellent pedigree in the World Championship and not for the first time a tremendous fightback Dave Askew SemiFinalist in 2001 and 2002 took a 31 lead against Keith Deller However the 1983 world champion Deller fought back taking six of the next seven legs to level the match at 33 and set up a deciding set  Deller took it in the tiebreak winning the set 53 to go through However both players played short of the best and Deller could qualify with a 76 average The second match saw the number 3 seed Peter Manley pushed the entire way by Wayne Atwood Atwood led 10 21 and 32 in sets and was at one stage just one leg away from victory before Manley sneaked the sixth set 32 Experience began to tell and Manley qualified with a 31 set victory in the decider A 170 finish from Manley helping the 3rd seeds cause The final match of the afternoon saw the number 6 seed Dennis Smith go through 42 over Les Fitton however Fitton pushed the final set to the deciding leg having the chance to go to the seventh set but Smith would go through

Four matches took place in the evening in the first Erik Clarys run came to an end The 2 time former world championship finalist Ronnie Baxter taking the match 42 however Clarys had levelled up at 22 from 20 behind A 170 finish from Baxter began to put the pressure back on the Belgian as the match concluded Then Bob Anderson 16 years after his first world title began his push for a second title In tremendous form he took the first three sets losing just three legs in the process to go 30 up on the 11th seed Andy Jenkins Jenkins took the fourth set 31 and got to 22 in the fifth before Anderson prevailed to book his place in the fourth round with an 8469 average

The big shock of the day and the entire event so far came in the third match of the evening John Parts reign as Champion would come to an end as he lost 43 to Mark Dudbridge Dudbridge took the first two sets 32 and 31 to open up a 20 lead Part responded by showing glimpses of the form that beat Taylor a year ago to level the match up at 22 However Dudbridged nicked the fifth set by 32 to go 32 up and 1 leg away from the match Part again responded taking the sixth set 31 to level the match at 3 sets apiece

The seventh set went into the tiebreak when the pair became locked at 22 in legs 22 became 33 as the 2nd seed tried desperately to hold onto his crown However Dudbridge would take the next two legs to decide the match as he went through to the fourth round The drama of this match probably meant that another thriller was overlooked in Kevin Painters 43 win over Paul Williams Painter had gone 31 up playing great darts however Williams had levelled up at 33 Painter would take the decider 31 to go through to the fourth round with an 8862 average

Seven more matches as the third round continued at the Circus Tavern In the opening game of the afternoon session Steve Beaton the 1996 BDO World Champion knocked out Jamie Harvey 40 However 40 was a rough scoreline on Harvey as Beaton took each set bar the opening set in deciding legs to break Bravedarts heart and go through The next surprise in the World Championship came in the shape of the 1995 BDO World Champion Richie Burnett going out 43 to Simon Whatley Whatley holding his nerve in a tense sudden death leg taking the final set 65 to knock out the 13th seed Whatley now would face Roland Scholten or Lionel Sams in the fourth round The final match of the afternoon would see the first of the home players in action Colin Lloyd seeded 5 averaged 9861 to go through 41 against Peter Evison Lloyd had been particularly clinical Evison taking the opening set 32 but Lloyd would take the remaining four with the loss of just one leg

In the evening session Steve Maish would go out to the other local hero Dagenhams number 12 seed Wayne Mardle by four sets to two Mardle who pushed Taylor to eight sets in their third round classic a year ago would take the final two sets after Maish had held his own Mardle would now face Lloyd for a place in the quarterfinals Then followed arguably the biggest surprise of the day Roland Scholten would bow out 42 to Lionel Sams Sams however would be relieved to hold on after squandering a 3 set lead and managing to take the 6 set by 31 Had Scholten managed to level at 33 then surely he would have been favourite to win the match

The former world Champion Phil Taylor would open up his quest to become the champion for the 11th time by quickly disposing of Colin McGarry Taylor took the first two sets 30 and then the next two 31 to go through 40 dropping just two legs and averaging 9889  He would be now meeting old rival Dennis Priestley as the 16th seed went through with a tense 43 win over Richie Buckle

With the increased number of days play the tournament held two matches in the afternoon session on New Years Eve The first one saw a repeat of the 1993 world final however John Lowe was unable to repeat the result He had led 30 against Alan Warriner but Warriner quickly dropping down the rankings recovered to win the match 43 taking the final set with a 42 tie
break margin

The final match of the third round saw the number 8 seed eliminated Denis Ovens recovered from 20 and 31 down to level the match at 33 However Alex Roy would go through to the fourth round with a straight legs victory in the decider winning through to meet Warriner in the last 16

Following the traditional evening off for New Years Eve the World Championships started 2004 at the fourth round stage In the last 16 matches were still best of 7 sets and all eight last 16 matches would be played today Following the surprising results in the third round just nine of the 16 seeds were remaining following the last 32 matches

In the opening match of the day Simon Whatley continued his run with a 41 win over Lionel Sams Sams had taken the first set 32 but Whatley replied in kind and then took 9 of the next 12 legs to book his place in Fridays quarterfinal matches Also heading through was Peter Manley the highest remaining seed from the bottom half of the draw knocked out 1983 champion Keith Deller 42 however he had been made to work for his victory Another 7 set thriller would be served up as Warriner moved through against Alex Roy Warriner took the first six legs to go 2 sets up Roy followed by taking 6 of the next 8 legs to level the match at 22 The titfortat game continued as Warriner and Roy both took their next sets comfortably the seventh set going to Alan by 3 legs to 0

The 7th seed Ronnie Baxter was heading home he lost 42 to Kevin Painter who hoped to reach the SemiFinals for the second successive year Painter took 9 of the first 14 legs as he went 30 up Baxter pinched the next two sets by 3 legs to 2 to close the gap to 1 set However this took a good deal out of Baxter and Painter strolled the sixth set to go through with a 9138 average Bob Anderson would also be going through to the quarterfinals he was unstoppable in the early stages against Dennis Smith taking a 31 lead over the number 6 seed However Smith responded taking the next two sets with the loss of three legs to level the match at 3 sets all Like Baxter Smith seemed jaded and Anderson took the decider 30 to go through to a match with Peter Manley

In the Home players duel Wayne Mardle and Colin Lloyd produced the match of the round taking a 31 lead Lloyd seemed to be cruising towards the quarterfinals his best run in a major since the 2002 world championship However from 31 down Mardle found a second wind winning 9 of the last 11 legs to take him through to the quarterfinals his first World Championship quarterfinal in the PDC In the battle of the old and current Masters the top seed Taylor was given a stern test by Dennis Priestley In a match played in a friendly spirit Taylor bossed the first two sets before Priestley took the third Taylor would edge the last two sets by 3 legs to 2 to win 41 however a 128 leg count doesnt do justice to the scoreline  In the final match Parts conqueror Mark Dudbridge would go through a 41 winner over Steve Beaton

Friday was quarterfinals day and matches had been extended to the best of 9 sets the first men to reach 5 sets would now qualify for the last four

The amazing run of form for Bob Anderson continued Averaging just under 91 Anderson took the first two sets and when Manley levelled the scores took the next three to win the match 52 and go through to the SemiFinals In the other afternoon match it was the end of the road for Mark Dudbridge Kevin Painter clinically winning 51 to book his match against Anderson

In the evening session Simon Whatley would also be found out he could take just six legs as Wayne Mardle booked his first ever PDC semifinal with a 51 win His opponent would be Phil Taylor after The Power took the first three sets in the grudge match against Alan Warriner and went on to win by five sets to one averaging 9826

A week ago 48 players lined up now just four remained Matches in the SemiFinals had been extended to the best of 11 sets however neither match went close

In the first match it was the end of the road for the 56 year old Bob Anderson Kevin Painter took nine of the first 10 legs in opening up a three set lead against the man drained after impressive wins over Jenkins Smith and Manley Anderson recovered to 22 in both the 4th and 5th sets however he was unable to convert them into victories as Painter moved 50 up and within one of a place in the final Painter took the sixth set by 31 to go through to the final a 60 winner Painter averaged 9672 but Anderson could be proud of his run which had seen him eliminate three seeds and get within one match of a second world final an average of 8769 for the tournament for the elder statesman of the game

In the second semifinal Phil Taylor took control early on against Wayne Mardle who played well After 4 sets Taylor was 40 up however he had been fortunate as two sets had been won in deciders Mardle got on the board in the fifth set by 32 and at 22 in the 6th was close to closing the gap to two sets Taylor pinched the 6th however to go 51 up Mardle replied by taking the 7th set but it delayed the inevitable Taylor taking the match 62 with a 10002 average

The final saw Phil Taylor up against Kevin Painter over the best of 13 sets If the 2003 final had been a classic this one lived up to its reputation Painter took the opening two sets in deciding legs to go 20 up At 22 in the third Painter had a chance to go 30 up but Taylor closed the gap However Painter took the next two sets 31 and 32 meaning that like John Part a year ago he led Taylor 41 after five sets at 22 in the sixth set Painter had his chances to lead 51 However Taylor recovered the sixth set and at the half way point the scoreline was 42 to Painter

The 6th set possibly changed things in the context of the match Painter who could arguably have been 60 up by this point against the 10time former world champion now began to struggle and Taylor took the seventh set threenil to close the gap to just the one set Painter held onto the lead by pinching the 8th set in a deciding leg to go 53 up However Taylor put on a spurt that saw him take 9 of the next 12 legs and to go in front by 6 sets to 5

Painter responded brilliantly taking the twelfth set 31 to level the match up at 66 The match entered the tiebreak in the 13th set and became the first PDC World Final to go to a sudden death leg as Painter and Taylor got level at 55 after almost four hours since the match began Painter who had thrown first in the set and twice was faced with a threedart outshot to win the title while leading 21 and 32 pulled his dart at the bullseye and Taylor hit the outerbull to throw first in the deciding leg Taylor opened up the leg with just 45 however Painter couldnt capitalise and was left on 316 after nine darts He again rallied setting up another threedart finish as Taylor eyed Double top Taylor missed at Double top then he missed at Double Ten and with unbearable tension hit the Double five to secure his 11th world title He then announced his retirement but changed his mind four days later

2003 PDC World Darts Championship
The 2003 Ladbrokescom World Darts Championship was the tenth World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it split from the British Darts Organisation in 1993 The tournament took place between 27 December 2002 and 4 January 2003 at the Circus Tavern Purfleet England Ladbrokes who sponsored the 1996 event with their Vernons brand took over sponsorship of the event from Skol

The field at the televised stages expanded for the first time since 1999 An extra qualifying round was introduced increasing the total number of players from 32 to 40 John Part defeated the defending champion and number one seed Phil Taylor in the final to end two incredible runs by Taylor  eight successive World titles and 44 successive victories at the Circus Tavern

This was Parts second world championship having also won the 1994 BDO Championship the first tournament after the split


All matches are the best of 7 sets

Highest threedart checkout 170 Roland Scholten Les Fitton

Tournament 180s scored 277 in 818 legs

Most 180s scored individual 27 John Part 22 Phil Taylor 18 Richie Burnett
This table shows the number of players by country in the World Championship the total number including the 1st round

Steve Brown the 1994 World Championship Semifinalist would become the first man through to the second draw with a 42 win over David Platt Platt a wildcard who had qualified via a competition in the People Newspaper  one of the tournaments key partners didnt disgrace himself at all and when leading 20 it looked good that he would move onto meet Phil Taylor in the second round However Browns experience told when he levelled the scores and would move through the next two sets to win

Australian Simon Whitlock would also be in round two following a 42 win over Paul Williams Having trailed 21 Whitlock won nine of the final 14 legs to book a date with number 6 seed and 2002 Finalist Peter Manley in round 2 Shayne Burgess the former world no3 who had recovered after a disastrous run of form in 2001 and 2002 including a 100 loss to Taylor in the World Matchplay 2002 would also move on to the second round following a 42 win over Arjan Moen who had been toetotoe at 22

Wayne Mardle the new boy to the PDC circuit having been in the quarterfinals and Semifinals of the BDO event would also begin clinically dropping 2 legs as he swept aside American Ray Carver by 4 sets to 0

Also going into round 2 on the first day in Purfleet was Reg Harding one of the perennial qualifiers who never seems to get beyond the opening round  this time he did just Mark Robinson took a commanding 30 lead against Harding before the Englishman fought back sneaking the sixth set 32 to draw level at 33 The decider would go all the way as Harding moved on to a match with 14th seed Kevin Painter in the second round Mark Holden would also go through in the 7th set beating Leeds Dave Smtih 31 in the deciding set

The First round would conclude with two matches today before the second round started Bob Anderson winner of the World Title in 1988 would be in terrific form as he lost just four legs in a 40 win over Al Hedman to move easily into round 2 and a match with 7th seed Colin Lloyd Mick Manning unlucky not to reach the last 16 in 2001 when he lost a sudden death leg to Dave Askew would take the final last 32 place in a 42 win over Lee Palfreyman

The Second round then opened up  matches still best of 7 sets  best of 5 legs Dennis Smith seeded 8th moving straight into the third round with a 41 win over former champion and four time beaten finalist at the Circus Tavern Dennis Priestley whose ranking had seriously deteriorated in the previous year since his first round exit as fifth seed twelve months ago  Priestley took the first set 32 but only took three other legs as Smiffy moved quickly onto a match with either 9th seed Denis Ovens or Alex Roy

Mark Holdens hopes of the title ended today with a 41 loss to Bravedart Jamie Harvey from Scotland Harvey seeded 15th would now face 2nd seed John Part or Cliff Lazarenko in the third round and hopes of a return to the quarterfinals of 2001 were still alive

Wayne Mardle produced a comeback at the Circus Tavern against 16th seed Peter Evison Mardle took the first set 31 but then proceeded to lose 9 of 13 legs as Evison moved on to take a 31 lead after four sets Mardle then won six legs in a row including checkouts of 115 and 144 saw Mardle get back on terms as the match moved into the deciding set Evison took the first but folded as Mardle took three legs on the bounce for a total of 9 in 10 as he moved to the third round stage on his debut at the Circus The winner of the next match between Taylor and Brown being Waynes opponent

Top seed Phil Taylor began his campaign for an 11th World Championship Title and a 9th in a row with a 41 win over Steve Brown Taylor had an average of 103 and took 6 of the first seven legs to go 20 up Brown recovered with a 30 set win to close the gap to 21 but they were to be his final legs Taylor took 6 more on the bounce to move into round 3 and a match with Mardle in the last 16

Six more third round places up for grabs as the first weekend concluded Denis Ovens would be the first man to move into the third round on Sunday with a 41 win over Alex Roy Ovens built a 30 lead but lost the fourth set Ovens took set five 31 to win 41 winning the match with a 157 checkout Dennis Smith in the third round for The Heat

Its rotten to play bad here Those were the words of John Lowe as the 13th seed was soon dispatched from the World Championship 41 by Les Fitton who led Phil Taylor in 2001 Fitton was brilliant in taking control of the scrappy sets and barely allowing Lowe shots at doubles to win legs Fitton would win 14 legs to Lowes 8 as he moved on to a match with either Alan Warriner or Rod Harrington

The man most people tipped to be the only threat to Taylor 2nd seed John Part would start his World Championship here with a 41 over Cliff Lazarenko Lazarenko 50 years old and with the support of much of the crowd fell 30 down before taking the fourth 32 Part won the 5th to progress to a match with Jamie Harvey though wasnt happy with his form

Rod Harringtons ranking had slipped worse than Dennis Priestleys and when the draw for the second round was made both he and Alan Warriner could curse their misfortune to draw each other early Two years ago this was a potential quarterfinal this year one wouldnt make it beyond the New Year The Iceman seeded fourth took a 20 lead before Harrington took set three to close the gap Warriner moved 31 ahead with a 30 set win before Harrington took the fifth However the home crowd were to be disappointed as Warriner moved on to round two by winning set six 32 for a 42 victory

Dave Askew had been to both the 2001 and 2002 Semifinals before losing 60 to Phil Taylor In the 2003 World Championship he began his campaign with a nervy 43 win over 1996 BDO World Champion Steve Beaton Askew led 10 trailed 21 led 32 before Beaton hauled himself level with askew at 3 sets each Askew took the 7th set 31 to move into the third round and a date with either Roland Scholten or Shayne Burgess

It would indeed be Scholten Seeded 5 Scholten took the first set 32 against Shayne Burgess Bulldog levelled up by winning the second set 31 However it was one way traffic from there Scholten winning 9 legs in a row to move through by four sets to one

The second round concluded today as the tournament moved towards its break for New Years Eve 7th seed Colin Lloyd one of the other Home players from Essex was given the fright of his life following a nervy 43 win over Bob Anderson who had recovered from 31 down to level at 33 and in the end Lloyd would be relieved to see the final double nailed as he won through to face Chris Mason who beat 10th seed Andy Jenkins 42 in a tight game early on before Mason twice a BDO semifinalist won through

Mick Manning also went out 41 to the number 3 seed Ronnie Baxter Hopeful that he could go one step further than his 1999 and 2000 World Championship final losses 65 to Barneveld and 60 to Hankey in the BDO and become the 2003 World Champion Baxter will now be linking up with 14th seed Kevin Painter who went through 41 against Reg Harding

The final third round pairing was Richie Burnett against Keith Dellar After six sets it was 33 Burnett won the deciding set 31 to win the match 43

6th seed Peter Manley was blown away 41 by Simon Whitlock of Australia Whitlock coolly under pressure took the first three sets in deciding legs to go 30 up when it could have been 30 Manley or 21 Manley sneaked home in the fourth to close the gap to 31 but he never looked like a winner a clearly shellshocked Whitlock taking the 5th set 30 to win 41

Following the traditional New Years Eve break the World Championships resumed in 2003 at the third round stage Matches now had been extended to best of 9 sets so the first man to five goes through to the quarterfinals

First man through to the quarterfinals today was Roland Scholen who swept past 12th seed Dave Askew by 5 sets to nil His opponent in the next round would be Alan Warriner who had a real battle with Les Fitton Fitton led 42 before Warriner levelled at 44 The set went 22 so the tiebreaker came into operation 33 and 44 before Warriner squeezed home 64 Had it been 55 then the sudden death leg would have taken place for the second time in the 2003 event

Dennis Smith would also be through the 2000 semifinalist sweeping home 51 against Denis Ovens in what was a cruel scoreline for The Heat as four of the six sets went 32 and the other pair 31 Smith would now meet Taylor or Mardle

The first of many classics between the pair was upon us

A 152 checkout from Mardle in the first leg set the tone for a strange game but a classic match  6 legs in a row from the Power saw him go 20 up and at 22 in the third set could have gone 30 up Mardle did win that set to close the gap Taylor edged the fourth 32 to go 31 in front before Mardle edged sets five and six 32 to level the scores at 33 However Taylor took the seventh and eighth sets 31 and to his and wife Yvones clear relief he was in the quarterfinals

Joining him would be number 2 seed John Part who had a tough time against Jamie Harvey of Scotland Harvey led 3 sets to 2 before Part recovered to win the final three sets and keep alive the possibility of a Final with Taylor on Sunday Parts opponent would be Chris Mason who ended the Essex crowds hopes of a home world Champion Chris in honest was ruthless taking 5 sets in a row after Lloyd had gone onenil up

Simon Whitlocks Purfleet adventure ended with a 53 loss to 11th seed Richie Burnett who should have won with more to spare as he quickly went 41 up Whitlock closed the gap to 43 but the Welshman took set eight 30 to set up a tie with 14th seed Kevin Painter who shocked Ronnie Baxter 53

A week ago 40 players lined up now eight remained QuarterFinals were still best of 9 sets and the first man to five would take a spot in the Semifinals on Saturday

John Part kept his hope of a Final with Taylor alive following a highquality 50 drubbing of Chris Mason Part made no mistake on dealing swiftly with Mason and dropped just four legs winning 15 as he moved into the last four 14th seed and surprise package Kevin Painter would be his opponent after The Artist brushed aside Richie Burnett to move to the Semifinals two more matches for the masterpiece  Four sets in a row from Painter to win 52 against Burnett who said hed had a terrible season

Part wasnt the only one desperate to meet Taylor 4th seed Alan Warriner claimed a 52 win over Roland Scholten and then stormed out of his Sky Sports interview to tell Taylor who was practising if you beat Smiffy I will sort you out

Warriner would get his chance though just for the second time this week Taylor had been extended and had to use his experience of getting through the tough matches in previous years to beat Dennis Smith 53 Smith led 32 and when 43 behind was 22 in legs Taylor seeded 1st again looked relieved to be through

Three of the top four seeds played on semifinals night Matches were extended to the Best of 11 sets so 6 sets and youre into the final

The first match was Part against Painter The first three sets went 22 and Part took a 2 sets to 1 lead it was just 87 in legs Painter won the fourth 31 before they shared 2 threetwo sets to make it 33 The leg count now 1514 to Painter showing how tight the match was Part won the seventh set 32 but Painter won the eight set 30 to level again

Part would sneak the final two sets 32 to win 64 In the end Painter could count himself unlucky as he took the most legs 2421 but still lost 64 The buildup to the Taylor v Warriner Semifinal was massive with Sky living on the storm out that Warriner could beat Taylor In the end it was a damp squib Taylor soon went 20 up in 6 straight legs Warriner won the third 31 but Taylor took the fourth 30 and the fifth 32 to go 41 up Taylor then won the sixth and seventh sets 30 Taylor won 61 and 195 in legs

The final would again be the best of 13 sets The last time these two had met Part had squeezed home and Taylor breezed through the night before It had led to a 70 for Taylor conceding three legs

Any inclinations of a match like that were soon ended as Part nailed a 121 checkout for the opening leg then hit double four and double ten to take the opening set 30 At 22 in set two Taylor missed double seven enabling Part to take this set too Taylor took the first leg of set three but Part nailed the next three legs to go three sets up

A 122 checkout from Taylor helped him to take his first set of the match but Part soon restored his threeset advantage Then Taylor stepped up a gear taking 12 of the next 14 legs and all of a sudden The Power had a 5 sets to 4 lead

Part however recovered brilliantly and took the tenth set 31 then edged the eleventh 32 to move within just one set of victory Taylor though fought back to take the twelfth set 31 forcing a deciding set

First blood in the decider went to Part with a 72 checkout before he missed double 15 for a 110 finish that would put him just one leg away from the title However Taylor missed double 16 thus giving Part another opportunity to make it 20 which he took It meant Taylor needed to take a minimum of four legs if Part wasnt to win another

Taylor closed the gap to 21 with a 98 checkout before in the fourth leg he needed to hit 121 to force a tiebreak He hit 17 and treble 18 before narrowly missing the bull It left Part with three darts for a 77 finish and the title Under enormous pressure he hit 19 18 and finally double top to end Taylors runs of eight successive World titles and 44 matches unbeaten at the Circus and take his second world championship in all after a truly thrilling final

Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox
Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox are the names of a pair of large statues of the American folk hero Paul Bunyan and his ox located in Bemidji Minnesota This roadside attraction has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1988 Much like the architecture found in such structures as the Benewah Milk Bottle the Teapot Dome Service Station or the comparably colossal Dinosaur Park sculptures in South Dakota it served to attract the attention of motorists passing by and coincided with the dramatic rise in the popularity of automobiles

The statues have been hailed by the Kodak Company as the second most photographed statues in the United States behind only Mount Rushmore in South Dakota

The city of Bemidji is located in a vast woodland and lake region As early as the 1890s the town saw a modest tourist trade When rail connections came to Bemidji in 1898 promoters began the development of lakeshore sites for cottages hotels and resorts Most of these resorts catered to hunters and anglers In the 1920s the rise in automobile popularity contributed to a significant boom in Bemidjis tourist industry but it along with the rest of the economy suffered during the Great Depression Enter Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox

As a means of stimulating tourism in Bemidji a number of local civic organizations sponsored a winter carnival meant to hype the citys resources for winter sports Due to Bemidjis once prominent status as a logging and lumbering center the celebrations focused on Paul Bunyan the largerthan life lumberjack who is an American folk hero On January 14 1937 the carnival opened with Earl L Grinols Sr the carnival king The onset of the carnival brought the unveiling of two giant statues one of Bunyan and the other of his giant blue ox Babe the pair would serve as carnival mascots Babe was brought into town on a Grinols Implement  Fuel Co truck arranged so that its exhaust exited through Babes nostrils

In March 2006 the Rotary Club of Bemidji raised 53000 and along with a 68000 federal grant set about to repair some damage to the statues In addition the money was to be used in maintenance with the majority slated for stabilizing the ground beneath the statues to lessen shifting in freezing temperatures The work also focused on a crack in Babe from the neck to the hindquarters which continued to widen despite yearly fixes by the city with caulk and blue paint

In October of 2013 local organizers ran the first Bemidji Blue Ox Marathon and planned the course to run past the statues

Paul Bunyan is approximately tall and measures across at his base From toe to heel Paul Bunyan measures  Babe the Blue Ox is about tall and across at the front hooves From nose to tail Babe measures about

Military history of South Africa
The military history of South Africa chronicles a vast time period and complex events from the dawn of history until the present time It covers civil wars and wars of aggression and of selfdefence both within South Africa and against it It includes the history of battles fought in the territories of modern South Africa in neighbouring territories in both world wars and in modern international conflicts

The arrival of the permanent settlements of the Dutch East India Company at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652 brought them face to face with the local people such as the Khoikhoi called Hottentots by the Dutch the San Bushmen and some Bantu peoples of South Africa While the Dutch traded with the Khoikhoi nevertheless serious disputes broke out over land ownership and livestock This resulted in attacks and counterattacks by both sides which were known as the KhoikhoiDutch Wars The First KhoikhoiDutch War took place in 1659 the second in 1673 and the third in 16741677

During 1664 tensions between England and the Netherlands rose with rumours of war being imminent  that same year Commander Zacharius Wagenaer was instructed to build a pentagonal castle out of stone at  On 26 April 1679 the five bastions were built The Castle of Good Hope is a fortification which was built on the original coastline of Table Bay and now because of land reclamation seems nearer the centre of Cape Town South Africa Built by the VOC between 1666 and 1679 the Castle is the oldest building in South Africa The Castle acted as local headquarters for the South African Army in the Western Cape but today houses the Castle Military Museum and ceremonial facilities for the traditional Cape Regiments

The Battle of Muizenberg was a small but significant battle for the future destiny of South Africa which took place at Muizenberg near Cape Town South Africa in 1795 it led to the capture of the Cape Colony by the United Kingdom A fleet of seven Royal Navy ships  five thirdrates Monarch 74 Victorious 74 Arrogant 74 America 64 and Stately 64 with the 16gun sloops Echo and Rattlesnake  under ViceAdmiral Elphinstone anchored in Simons Bay at the Cape of Good Hope in June 1795 having left England on 1 March Their commander suggested to the Dutch governor that he place the Cape Colony under the protection of the British monarch  in effect that he hand the colony over to Britain  which was refused Simons Town was occupied on 14 June by a force of 350 Royal Marines and 450 men of the 78th Highlanders before the defenders could burn the town Following skirmishes on 1 and 2 September a final general attempt to recapture the camp was prepared by the Dutch for the 3rd but at this point the British reinforcements arrived and the Dutch withdrew A British advance on Cape Town with the new reinforcements began on the 14th on the 16th the colony capitulated

The British assumed control of the Cape of Good Hope for the next seven years The Cape was returned to the restored Dutch government known as the Batavian Government in 1804 In 1806 the British returned and after again defeating the Dutch at the Battle of Blaauwberg stayed in control for more than 100 years

The Xhosa Wars also known as the Kaffir Wars or Cape Frontier Wars were a series of nine wars between parts of the Xhosa people and European settlers with their Xhosa allies from 1779 and 1879 in what is now the Eastern Cape in South Africa The wars were responsible for the Xhosa peoples loss of most of their land and the incorporation of its people into Europeancontrolled territories

The NdwandweZulu War of 18171819 was a war fought between the expanding Zulu kingdom and the Ndwandwe tribe in South Africa Shaka revolutionised traditional ways of fighting by introducing the assegai a spear with a short shaft and broad blade used as a closequarters stabbing weapon Under Shakas rule losing an assegai was punishable by death So it was never thrown like a javelin He also organised warriors into disciplined units known as Impis that fought in close formation behind large cowhide shields In the Battle of Gqokli Hill in 1819 his troops and tactics prevailed over the superior numbers of the Ndwandwe people who failed to destroy the Zulu in their first encounter

The Ndwandwe and the Zulus met again in combat at the Battle of Mhlatuze River in 1820 The Zulu tactics again prevailed pressing their attack when the Ndwandwe army was divided during the crossing of the Mhlatuze River Zulu warriors arrived at the Ndwande King Zwides headquarters near presentday Nongoma before news of the defeat and approached the camp singing Ndwandwe victory songs to gain entry Zwide fled with some of his offspring including Madzanga Most of the Ndwandwe abandoned their lands and migrated north and eastward This was the start of the Mfecane a catastrophic bloody migration of many different tribes in the area initially escaping the Zulus but themselves causing their own havoc after adopting Zulu tactics in war Shaka was the ultimate victor and his more peaceful descendants still live today throughout Zululand with customs and a way of life that can be easily traced to Shakas day

Mfecane Zulu also known as the Difaqane or Lifaqane Sesotho is an African expression which means something like the crushing or scattering It describes a period of widespread chaos and disturbance in southern Africa during the period between 1815 and about 1835

The Mfecane resulted from the rise to power of Shaka the Zulu king and military leader who conquered the Nguni peoples between the Tugela and Pongola rivers in the beginning of the 19th century and created a militaristic kingdom in the region The Mfecane also led to the formation and consolidation of other groups  such as the Matabele the Mfengu and the Makololo  and the creation of states such as the modern Lesotho

The Battle of Italeni in what is now KwaZuluNatal South Africa in early 1838 between the Voortrekkers and the Zulus during the period of the Great Trek resulted in the Zulu armies repulsing the Voortrekkers On 9 April near the Babanango Mountain Range a large Zulu impi army appeared consisting of approximately 8000 warriors The Voortrekker commandos returned to their camp on 12 April Boer general Piet Uys formed a raiding party of fifteen volunteers including his son Dirkie Uys During subsequent fighting Uys his son the Malan brothers as well as five of the volunteers were killed and the Voortrekkers were forced to retreat It has been speculated that without the lessons learnt as a result of the Battle of Italeni  such as fighting from the shelter of oxwagons whenever possible and choosing the place of battle rather than being enticed into unfavourable terrain  the Voortrekkers would not have succeeded in finally beating the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River eight months later

The Battle of Blood River  was fought on 16 December 1838 on the banks of the Blood River Bloedrivier in what is today KwaZuluNatal South Africa In the aftermath of the Weenen massacre a group of about 470 Voortrekkers led by Andries Pretorius defended a laager circle of ox wagons against Zulu impis ruled by King Dingane and led by Dambuza Nzobo and Ndlela kaSompisi numbering between 10 and 20 thousand The Zulus repeatedly and unsuccessfully attacked the laager until Pretorius ordered a group of horse riders to leave the encampment and engage the Zulus Partly due to the fact that the Voortrekkers used rifles and at least one light cannon against the Zulus spears as well as the good location and motivation of the Voortrekkers only three Voortrekkers were wounded and none perished that contrasted against the more than 3000 Zulu warriors who died The Voortrekkers credited God as the reason why they had won the battle as they had made a covenant asking for protection beforehand

The AngloZulu War was fought in 1879 between Britain and the Zulus and signalled the end of the Zulus as an independent nation It was precipitated by Sir Bartle Frere High Commissioner for Southern Africa who manufactured a casus belli and prepared an invasion without the approval of Her Majestys government

At the Battle of Isandlwana 22 January 1879 the Zulu overwhelmed and wiped out 1400 British soldiers This battle is considered to be one of the greatest disasters in British colonial history Isandlwana forced the policy makers in London to rally to the support of the prowar contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulu The first invasion of Zululand ended with the catastrophe of Isandlwana where along with heavy casualties the main centre column lost all supplies transport and ammunition and the British would be forced to halt their advances elsewhere while a new invasion was prepared At Rorkes Drift 2223 January 1879 139 British soldiers successfully defended the station against an intense assault by four to five thousand Zulu warriors

The Battle of Intombe was fought on 12 March 1879 between British and Zulu forces The Siege of Eshowe took place during a threepronged attack on the Impis of Cetshwayo at Ulundi The Battle of Gingindlovu uMgungundlovu was fought between a British relief column sent to break the Siege of Eshowe and the Impis of Cetshwayo on 2 April 1879 The battle restored the British commanders confidence in their army and their ability to defeat Zulu With the last resistance removed they were able to advance and relieve Eshowe The Battle of Hlobane was a total disaster for the British 15 officers and 110 men were killed a further 8 wounded and 100 native soldiers died The Battle of Kambula took place in 1879 when a Zulu army attacked the British camp at Kambula resulting in a massive Zulu defeat The Battle of Ulundi took place at the Zulu capital of Ulundi on 4 July 1879 and proved to be the decisive battle that finally broke the military power of the Zulu nation

The First Boer War also known as the First AngloBoer War or the Transvaal War was fought from 16 December 1880 until 23 March 1881 and was the first clash between the British and the South African Republic ZAR Boers It was precipitated by Sir Theophilus Shepstone who annexed the South African Republic Transvaal Republic for the British in 1877 The British consolidated their power over most of the colonies of South Africa in 1879 after the AngloZulu War and attempted to impose an unpopular system of confederation on the region The Boers protested and in December 1880 they revolted
The battles of Bronkhorstspruit Laings Nek Schuinshoogte and Majuba Hill proved disastrous for the British where they found themselves outmaneuvered and outperformed by the highly mobile and skilled Boer marksmen With the British commanderinchief of Natal George Pomeroy Colley killed at Majuba and British garrisons under siege across the entire Transvaal the British were unwilling to further involve themselves in a war which was already seen as lost As a result William Gladstones British government signed a truce on 6 March and in the final peace treaty on 23 March 1881 gave the Boers selfgovernment in the South African Republic Transvaal under a theoretical British oversight

The Jameson Raid 29 December 1895  2 January 1896 was a raid on Paul Krugers Transvaal Republic carried out by Leander Starr Jameson and his Rhodesian and Bechuanaland policemen over the New Year weekend of 189596 It was intended to trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate workers known as Uitlanders or in English Foreigners in the Transvaal but failed to do so Though the raid was ineffective and no uprising took place it did much to bring about the Second Boer War and the Second Matabele War

The affair brought AngloBoer relations to a dangerous low and the ill feeling was heightened by the Kruger telegram from the German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II It congratulated Paul Kruger for defeating the raid as well as appearing to recognise the Boer republic and offer support The emperor was already perceived as antiBritish and a naval arms race had started between Germany and Britain Consequently the telegram alarmed and angered the British

The Second Boer War also known as the Second AngloBoer War the Second Freedom War Afrikaans and referred to as the South African War in modern times took place from 11 October 1899  31 May 1902 The war was fought between Great Britain and the two independent Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic referred to as the Transvaal by the British After a protracted hardfought war the two independent republics lost and were absorbed into the British Empire

In all the war had cost around 75000 lives  22000 British soldiers 7792 battle casualties the rest through disease 60007000 Boer Commandos 2000028000 Boer civilians mostly women and children due to disease in concentration camps and an estimated 20000 black Africans Boer allies who died in their own separate concentration camps The last of the Boer forces surrendered in May 1902 and the war ended with the Treaty of Vereeniging in the same month The war resulted in the creation of the Transvaal Colony which in 1910 was incorporated into the Union of South Africa The treaty ended the existence of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State as Boer republics and placed them within the British Empire

The Boers referred to the two wars as the Freedom Wars Those Boers who wanted to continue the fight were known as bittereinders or irreconcilables and at the end of the war a number like Deneys Reitz chose exile rather than sign an undertaking that they would abide by the peace terms Over the following decade many returned to South Africa and never signed the undertaking Some like Reitz eventually reconciled themselves to the new status quo but others waited for a suitable opportunity to restart the old quarrel At the start of World War I the bittereinders and their allies took part in a revolt known as the Maritz Rebellion

The Union of South Africa which came into being in 1910 tied closely to the British Empire joined Great Britain and the allies against the German Empire Both Prime Minister Louis Botha and Defence Minister Jan Smuts both former Second Boer War generals who had fought against the British then but who now became active and respected members of the Imperial War Cabinet See Jan Smuts during World War I

The Union Defence Force was part of significant military operations against Germany In spite of Boer resistance at home the Afrikanerled government of Louis Botha unhestitatingly joined the side of the Allies of World War I and fought alongside its armies The South African Government agreed to the withdrawal of British Army units so that they were free to join the European war and laid plans to invade German SouthWest Africa Elements of the South African army refused to fight against the Germans and along with other opponents of the Government rose in open revolt The government declared martial law on 14 October 1914 and forces loyal to the government under the command of General Louis Botha and Jan Smuts proceeded to destroy the Maritz Rebellion The leading Boer rebels got off lightly with terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines See World War I and the Maritz Rebellion

The Union Defence Force saw action in a number of places


More than 146000 whites 83000 blacks and 2500 people of mixed race Coloureds and Asians served in South African military units during the war including 43000 in German SouthWest Africa and 30000 on the Western Front An estimated 3000 South Africans also joined the Royal Flying Corps The total South African casualties during the war was about 18600 with over 12452 killed  more than 4600 in the European theatre alone
The Commonwealth War Graves commission has records of 9457 known South African War dead during World War I 

There is no question that South Africa greatly assisted the Allies and Great Britain in particular in capturing the two German colonies of German South West Africa and German East Africa as well as in battles in Western Europe and the Middle East South Africas ports and harbours such as at Cape Town Durban and Simons Town were also important reststops refuellingstations and served as strategic assets to the British Royal Navy during the war helping to keep the vital sea lanes to the British Raj open

On the eve of World War II the Union of South Africa found itself in a unique political and military quandary While it was closely allied with Great Britain being a coequal Dominion under the 1931 Statute of Westminster with its head of state being the British king the South African Prime Minister on 1 September 1939 was none other than Barry Hertzog the leader of the proAfrikaner antiBritish National party that had joined in a unity government as the United Party

Hertzogs problem was that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against Nazi Germany The PolishBritish Common Defence Pact obligated Britain and in turn its dominions to help Poland if attacked by the Nazis After Hitlers forces attacked Poland in the morning of 1 September 1939 Britain declared war on Germany within a few days A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa especially in the halls of power in the Parliament of South Africa that pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britains side led by the proAllied proBritish Afrikaner and former Prime Minister Jan Smuts and General against thencurrent Prime Minister Barry Hertzog who wished to keep South Africa neutral if not proAxis

On 4 September 1939 the United Party caucus refused to accept Hertzogs stance of neutrality in World War II and deposed him in favour of Smuts Upon becoming Prime Minister of South Africa Smuts declared South Africa officially at war with Germany and the Axis Smuts immediately set about fortifying South Africa against any possible German sea invasion because of South Africas global strategic importance controlling the long sea route around the Cape of Good Hope

Smuts took severe action against the proNazi South African Ossewabrandwag movement they were caught committing acts of sabotage and jailed its leaders for the duration of the war One of them John Vorster was to become future Prime Minister of South Africa See Jan Smuts during World War II

Prime Minister Jan Smuts was the only important nonBritish general whose advice was constantly sought by Britains wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet in 1939 as the most senior South African in favour of war On 28 May 1941 Smuts was appointed a Field Marshal of the British Army becoming the first South African to hold that rank Ultimately Smuts would pay a steep political price for his closeness to the British establishment to the King and to Churchill which had made Smuts very unpopular among the conservative nationalistic Afrikaners leading to his eventual downfall whereas most Englishspeaking whites and a minority of liberal Afrikaners in South Africa remained loyal to him See Jan Smuts during World War II

South Africa and its military forces contributed in many theatres of war South Africas contribution consisted mainly of supplying troops airmen and material for the North African campaign the Desert War and the Italian Campaign as well as to Allied ships that docked at its crucial ports adjoining the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean that converge at the tip of Southern Africa Numerous volunteers also flew for the Royal Air Force See South African Army in World War II South African Air Force in World War II South African Navy in World War II


Of the 334000 men volunteered for fulltime service in the South African Army during the war including some 211000 whites 77000 blacks and 46000 coloureds and Asians nearly 9000 were killed in action

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has records of 11023 known South African war dead during World War II

However not all South Africans supported the war effort The AngloBoer war had ended only thirty five years earlier and to some siding with the enemy was considered disloyal and unpatriotic These sentiments gave rise to The Ossewabrandwag Oxwagon Sentinel originally created as a cultural organisation on the Centenary of the Great Trek becoming more militant and openly opposing South African entry into the war on side of the British The organisation created a paramilitary group called Stormjaers storm chasers modelled on the Nazi SA or Sturmabteilung Storm Division and which was linked to the German Intelligence Abwehr and the German Foreign Office Dienstelle Ribbentrop via Dr Luitpold Werz  the former German Consul in Pretoria The Stormjaers carried out a number of sabotage attacks against the Smuts government and actively tried to intimidate and discourage volunteers from joining the army recruitment programs

In the Korean War the 2 Squadron The Flying Cheetahs took part as South Africas contribution It won many American decorations including the honour of a United States Presidential Unit Citation in 1952

Some sources list 35 deaths from 2 Squadron

The Simonstown Agreement was a naval cooperation agreement between the United Kingdom and South Africa signed 30 June 1955 Under the agreement the Royal Navy gave up its naval base at Simonstown South Africa and transferred command of the South African Navy to the government of South Africa In return South Africa promised the use of the Simonstown base to Royal Navy ships

US Intelligence believed that Israel participated in South African nuclear research projects and supplied advanced nonnuclear weapons technology to South Africa during the 1970s while South Africa was developing its own atomic bombs
According to David Albright writing for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Faced with sanctions South Africa began to organize clandestine procurement networks in Europe and the United States and it began a long secret collaboration with Israel although he goes on to say A common question is whether Israel provided South Africa with weapons design assistance although available evidence argues against significant cooperation According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative in 1977 Israel traded 30grams of tritium in exchange for 50 tons of South African uranium and in the mid80s assisted with the development of the RSA3 ballistic missile Also in 1977 according to foreign press reports it was suspected that South Africa signed a pact with Israel that included the transfer of military technology and the manufacture of at least six atom bombs

Chris McGreal has claimed that Israel provided expertise and technology that was central to South Africas development of its nuclear bombs In 2000 Dieter Gerhardt Soviet spy and a former commodore in the South African Navy claimed that Israel agreed in 1974 to arm eight Jericho II missiles with special warheads for South Africa


Between 1966 and 1989 South Africa waged a long and bitter counterinsurgency campaign against the Peoples Liberation Army of Namibia PLAN in SouthWest Africa PLAN was backed by the Soviet Union and a number of Warsaw Pact member states as well as several sympathetic newly independent African governments It also received considerable combat support from the Peoples Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola FAPLA and a sizeable contingent of Cuban military advisors In response South Africa underwent a massive military expansion to combat the PLAN threat which included the formation of several elite special forces units such as Koevoet 32 Battalion and the Reconnaissance Commando Regiment South African troops raided neighbouring states to strike at PLAN forward operating bases which occasionally entailed clashes with FAPLA and the Zambian Defence Force This largely undeclared conflict became known as the South African Border War during the late 1970s

SADF expeditionary forces targeted guerrilla bases refugees and rural infrastructure in Angola and Zambia depending initially on border raids patrols and air strikes to keep PLAN at bay This was eventually extended to a permanent SADF military presence throughout southern Angola with the objective of forcing PLAN bases to relocate further and further north While this strategy was successful it resulted in the parallel expansion of FAPLA with Soviet assistance to meet what Luanda perceived as a direct South African threat to Angolan sovereignty FAPLA and the SADF clashed continuously between 1981 and 1984 and again from 1987 to 1988 culminating in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale

The South African Border War was closely linked to the Angolan Civil War South African expeditionary units had openly invaded Angola in 1975 during Operation Savannah an illfated attempt to support two rival Angolan factions the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola UNITA and the National Liberation Front of Angola FNLA during the civil war The SADF was forced to withdraw under overwhelming pressure from thousands of Cuban combat troops When South Africa began intensifying its campaign against PLAN in the 1980s it reasserted its alliance with UNITA and took the opportunity to bolster that movement with training and captured PLAN weaponry

The Battle of Cuito Cuanavale proved to be a major turning point for both conflicts as it resulted in the Angolan Tripartite Accord in which Cuba pledged to withdraw its troops from Angola while South Africa withdrew from SouthWest Africa SouthWest Africa received independence as the Republic of Namibia in 1990

South Africa has produced a variety of significant weapons vehicles and planes for its own uses as well as for international export Some have been established weapons produced under licence and in other instances South Africa has innovated and manufactured its own weapons and vehicles The predominant manufacturer of weapons is Denel

During the 1960s and 1970s Armscor produced a great deal of South Africas armament as South Africa was under UN sanctions It was during this time that Armscor contracted with Gerald Bulls Space Research Corporation for advanced 155mm howitzer designs which it eventually produced used and exported to countries such as Iraq

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s it was common for antiapartheid political movements to form military wings such as Umkhonto we Sizwe MK which was created by the African National Congress and the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army APLA of the PanAfricanist Congress These functioned as de facto guerrilla armies carrying out acts of sabotage and waging a limited rural insurgency The guerrillas occasionally clashed with each other as their respective political organs jockeyed for internal influence

Though fought on a much smaller scale than the South African Border War the SADFs operations against MK and APLA mirrored several important aspects of that conflict Much like PLAN for example MK often sought sanctuary in states adjacent to South Africas borders The SADF retaliated with targeted assassinations of MK personnel on foreign soil and a combination of air strikes and special forces raids on MK bases in Zambia Mozambique Botswana and Lesotho

Both MK and APLA were disbanded and integrated with the South African National Defence Force SANDF following the abolition of apartheid

The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging AWB  Afrikaner Resistance Movement  was formed in 1973 in Heidelberg Transvaal a town southeast of Johannesburg It is a political and paramilitary group in South Africa and was under the leadership of Eugne TerreBlanche They are committed to the restoration of an independent Afrikaner republic or Boerestaat within South Africa In their heyday the period of transition in the early 1990s they received much publicity both in South Africa and abroad as an extremist white supremacist group

During the Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa the AWB stormed the venue the Kempton Park World Trade Centre breaking through the glass front of the building with an armoured car The invaders took over the main conference hall threatening delegates and painting slogans on the walls and left again after a short period
In 1994 before the advent of majority rule the AWB again gained international notoriety in its attempt to defend the dictatorial government of Lucas Mangope in the homeland of Bophuthatswana who opposed the upcoming elections and the dissolution of his homeland The AWB along with a contingent of about 90 Afrikaner Volksfront militiamen entered the capital of Mmabatho on 10 and 11 March
TerreBlanche was sentenced for the attempted murder of security guard Paul Motshabi but he only served three years In June 2004 he was released from prison Terreblanche claimed that while in prison he rediscovered God and has dropped some of his more violent and racist policies He preached reconciliation as prescribed by God in his later years TerreBlanche was murdered on his farm on 3 April 2010

The South African National Defence Force SANDF is the name of the presentday armed forces of South Africa The military as it exists today was created in 1994 following South Africas first postapartheid national elections and the adoption of a new constitution It replaced the South African Defence Force SADF and included personnel and equipment from the SADF and the former Homelands forces Transkei Venda Bophuthatswana and Ciskei as well as personnel from the former guerrilla forces of some of the political parties involved in South Africa such as the African National Congresss Umkhonto we Sizwe the Pan Africanist Congresss APLA and the SelfProtection Units of the Inkatha Freedom Party IFP

As of 2004 the integration process was considered complete with the integrated personnel having been incorporated into a slightly modified structure very similar to that of the SADF with the latters structure and equipment for the most part being retained

The commander of the SANDF is appointed by the President from one of the armed services The current commander is General Solly Shoke He in turn is accountable to the Minister of Defence currently Nosiviwe Noluthando MapisaNqakula

Some of the Traditional South African Regiments have been serving the country for over a hundred and fifty years under various iterations of political systems and different governments

The South African Department of Defences Strategic Defence Acquisition known as the Arms Deal aimed to modernise its defence equipment which included the purchase of corvettes submarines light utility helicopters leadin fighter trainers and advanced light fighter aircraft This saw the SANDF being provided with modern equipment

Recent peacekeeping actions on the behalf of the South African military include the South African intervention in Lesotho in order to restore the democratically elected government after a coup as well as extensive contributions to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi An operation to Sudan has recently begun and is scheduled to be increased to Brigade strength

Issues that face the SANDF include a severe shortage of pilots and naval combat officers due to the replacement of white officers from the former SADF with appointments from the old liberation forces and emigration The loss of trained personnel and the decommissioning of much needed equipment due to funding issues high HIVrates amongst personnel and the fact that SANDF infantry soldiers are some of the oldest in the world all raise questions regarding the current fighting efficiency of the SANDF Some of these issues are being addressed with the introduction of the Military Skills Development MSD programme as well as aggressive recruitment and training by the Reserve Force Regiments

Recently the SANDF has been involved in combat in both the Central African Republic Bangui as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo FIB The performance of the SANDF soldiers in combat in these two theatres has gone a long way towards silencing critics of the combat effectiveness of the actual soldiers but has refocused the debate on that of the political leadership as well as the procurement and recruitment issues that still abound

Four armed services make up the forces of the SANDF

Rodderberg
The Rodderberg is an extinct volcano in the east of the municipality of Wachtberg near Bonn Germany The last eruption was 250000years ago

It is situated just above the Rhinevalley Together with the Drachenfels directly opposite the Rodderberg narrows the Rhinevalley This gorge portion is the southern limit of the lowlandbay of Cologne

The Rodderberg offers views to the Siebengebirge the Rhinevalley and up to the Cologne Cathedral about 50km away

The Rodderberg detonated in a phreatomagmatic eruption about 250000years ago This happened when the magmatic plume reached the groundwater level of the Rhine about 50m higher than today After the explosion the crater was filled with water that formed a maar of about 90m depth In the last 250000years this feature filled with dust and soil until it was filled up to todays level

At present all that is left of the old Volcano is just a small hill which has a shallow craterous form on its surface  if one doesnt know that it is a volcano you would not see it

History of Pocklington
The town of Pocklington in the East Riding of Yorkshire England has a recorded written history that goes back around 1500 years and archaeological evidence shows settlement at the site as long as 2500 years ago This gives it a longer history of settlement than larger contemporary settlements in the region and country such as York and even London During this time it has experienced plague several invasions the loss of its railway and its marginalisation to a backwater under the Romans Nevertheless Pocklington has prospered where other market towns have failed It has always been the commercial and civic centre for the district and was at one point the second largest settlement in Yorkshire It is the focal point of an area which has seen significant events through the centuries many influencing English history

Pocklington gets its name via the Old English Poclintun from the Anglian settlement of Pocels or Pocelas people and the Old English word tun meaning farm or settlement A D Mills The Popular Dictionary of English PlaceNames but though the towns name can only be traced back to around 650AD the inhabitation of Pocklington as a site is thought to extend back a further 1000 years or more to the Bronze Age

It is not known exactly when there was first a settlement at Pocklington  archaeologists have found Iron Age remains in and around the town and many Bronze Age burials and other finds have been discovered in the neighbourhood More recently in 2016 builders uncovered an earlier Bronze Age settlement dating to around 800BC

In 1937 wooden planks belonging to an ancient boat were discovered by a local man in nearby Ferriby Originally estimated to date from 1300BC newer estimates using radiocarbon dating have placed the boats between the years 1890BC to 1700BC

Certainly the Wolds area as a whole was a very attractive location for settlements to ancient man who preferred to stay clear of the poorly drained and often flooded neighbouring vales  before the draining of a lot of land in the medieval era the flat land to the west and south of Pocklington was very marshy

Archaeologists have experienced problems in recovering early remains and artefacts from the area intact because of the damage and disruption caused by centuries of arable land use  one skeleton discovered in 2005 was intact apart from its skull which had been sheared off and crushed by a plough

Ptolemy relates that the Parisii an ancient Briton tribe with branches in France and after which Paris itself is named inhabited a large part of what is now the East Riding of Yorkshire in the late Iron Age 50BC Ptolemy Geography They were probably displaced to Britain by population movements on the continent It is possible that Pocklington was settled by the Parisii as early as the 5thcenturyBC but certainly by the time the Parisii participated in the general rising of Vercingetorix against Julius Caesar in 52BC there is strong evidence that their regional capital was based at Pocklington itself

Archeology has also discovered a substantial late Iron Age settlement of roundhouses in nearby Hayton

It is during the era of the Roman occupation that Pocklington suffered something of a reversal in its development It was eclipsed by York as the prominent settlement within the Yorkshire region with the City of York effectively beginning its life during this era and swiftly eclipsing Pocklignton in size and importance Despite Pocklingtons existing status and size at the time York was favoured as the site of the Roman city Eboracum in around 71AD It is thought to have been selected whilst Pocklington was ignored because of its better water access River Ouse accessible via Humber estuary and because it was a naturally crossing point on a plain of routes from all directions

Despite Ermine Street the primary Roman arterial road north from London running close by Pocklington the town was not garrisoned by Roman forces A legionary barracks and important Roman town were constructed in York which was for several years the home of the Roman Imperial Court and effectively the centre of administration for the Roman Empire but Pocklington likely remained a Romaninfluenced but little altered Iron Age settlement There is archaeological evidence for some signs of Romanization cultural in Pocklington including a Romanstyle bathhouse

The Roman name for Pocklington is not known but it is thought that Pocklington might be the presently unlocated Delgovicia meaning out of the way place or literally backwater However Millington and Malton are competing candidates for this placename also By the time Ptolemy wrote his Geography in approximately 140AD he made no mention of Pocklington but instead referred to the capital of the RomanoBritish Parisi as being located in Petuaria near modernday Brough Given that the Parisi themselves were nonliterate and Ptolemy was writing at some remove it is difficult now to know whether their capital shifted from Pocklington to Brough or whether it was always at Pocklington or always at Brough

Around this time the Roman authorities raised an irregular auxiliary unit from the area known as the Company of Newcomers Collingwood  Wright The Roman Inscriptions of Britain

There is also evidence of a Roman villa just outside Pocklington and although it is not known who occupied it is suspected to have been a RomanoBritish chief

In 2004 diggers excavating the site near Pocklington unearthed fragments of a human skeleton which almost certainly dated back to Roman times A quantity of Roman era pottery dating back to between 70AD and 410AD has also been uncovered scattered across the same field

It is known that at least as early as the 4thcentury large tracts of land in the Pocklington area and the Wolds were granted to Germanic Foederati  continental warlords possibly of the Alemanni who were given areas of farmland in return for military service It is not known to what extent this influx replaced or mingled with the earlier inhabitants

It was some time before 650AD that Pocklington gained its current name meaning farmstead belonging to Pocelas people It is not known what name Pocklington was known by before that date

It is reputed that the ancient kingdom of Deira has its capital nearby It is likely that the missionary Paulinus established the first Christian church in Pocklington on his way from Goodmanham to found York Minster Certainly the Sotheby Cross dating from the late 14thcentury in the churchyard at All Saints Church has the inscription Paulinus here preached and celebrated AD627

The Great Heathen Army of the Vikings captured much of the area in 866 and in 876 their remnants settled permanently in parts of the Yorkshire countryside Viking kings ruled this area known to historians as The Viking Kingdom of Jorvik for almost a century In 954 the last Viking king Eric Bloodaxe was expelled and his kingdom was incorporated in the newly consolidated AngloSaxon state

Many English towns are able to find mention of themselves in the Domesday Book William the Conquerors catalogue of the country Even before the Norman Conquest however records of Pocklington are found in taxation census of Anglo Saxon kings

Pocklington steadily evolved from Anglo Saxon times as the centre of the surrounding agricultural area Before the Norman conquest when King Harolds brotherinlaw Earl Morcar was Lord of the Manor it was a prosperous settlement

The Battle of Stamford Bridge was fought just 4 miles from Pocklington and was the first of two major battles in that year for control of the country the other being the Battle of Hastings The former marked the end of Viking rule in England and the latter ushered in a period of Norman rule

After the Norman conquest the manor at Pocklington became a royal manor  with the Percy family as the Kings overlords  and under this royal patronage Pocklington continued to prosper Pocklington was recorded in the Domesday Book as Poclinton and given its current size it is surprising to note that at the time of Domesday 1086 it is recorded as being the second largest settlement in Yorkshire after York itself showing clearly that it had bounced back from its marginalisation in Roman Britain

Pocklington developed through the Middle Ages while many similar places fell into dramatic decline Pocklington owed much of its prosperity in the Middle Ages to the fact it was a local centre for the trading of wool and that it lay on the main road to York an important national centre for the export of wool to the Continent Wool was Englands principal export in the Middle Ages

A weekly market and regular fairs in the town were held by Royal Charter in 1245 Regular fairs continued until the early 1900s

The towns All Saints Church is the only survivor from the Middle Ages Known as the Cathedral of the Wolds it dates from the late 12th to early 15thcenturies Although containing some fragments of the earlier Norman church its foundations go back further to the original Saxon era The clerestory is 13thcentury and the tower is 15th

Parish records show that the Black Death the bubonic plague struck Pocklington hard in 1350 a year after its first outbreak in London and the south coast

Pocklington School was founded in 1514 as the Guild of the Parish Church by senior churchmen and politician John Dolman His family became Lords of the Manor in the 14thcentury

In 1400 Pocklington was one of 30 East Riding of Yorkshire settlements which could be termed market towns By 1750 there were just 10 and Pocklington was one Over the next 150 years the town trebled in size with a host of new trades joining existing agricultural brewing and milling interests

Pocklington has one of the few Cromwellian charters in the country The town charter was granted on 8 September 1656 one of the few during Oliver Cromwells 11 years

Pocklington also lays claim to being the last place in England to hold a witch burning In 1630 the parish register for that year records Old Wife Green burnt in Market for being a witch

In 1848 a cache of more than 500 coins from 1500 to 1700 was found on the edge of town

And 19 years later the towns most notorious resident Isabella Bilington aged 32 was sentenced to death at York Assizes for crucifying her mother at Pocklington After the killing she burnt a calf and a cock as a sacrifice Her husband too was hanged as an accomplice

William Wilberforce wrote his first public letter against the slave trade while at Pocklington School from 177176 and went on to be the driving force behind the abolition of slavery in the early 19thcentury This is celebrated by the broken linked chain in the present town coat of arms

John Wesley the founder of Methodism was a frequent visitor to Pocklington in the late 18thcentury and is among several notable churchmen bishops and titular archbishops born or educated in the town A Wesleyan Methodist Church survives in use in Pocklington to this day

Entertainment also earned the town notoriety The celebrated Flying Man of Pocklington Thomas Pelling attempted in 1733 to travel along a rope between the church and the Star Inn in the Market Square He crashed to his death fracturing his skull against the wall of the church following a misunderstanding with men working the windlass He is buried where he fell at the east end of the church where a plaque celebrates his memory

In 1759 a Pocklington brewer called Timothy Overland received a piece of land on the York to Beverley road on the southern fringe of Pocklington and built the Pocklington New Inn By 1778 the establishment was a prosperous Coach House at the height of the coaching era The building is still in the same use today as the Pocklington Motel

By this time the seat of the Lord of the Manor had transferred to Kilnwick Percy Hall The present house was built in 1784 although there had been a hall there for many centuries Unfortunately a large section of it fell into disrepair and was pulled down during the 1940s The remainder has belatedly been classed as a Grade II listed Georgian mansion

Steady further growth continued during the 19thcentury which saw much of the town completely rebuilt

In 1814 an act of parliament was passed for making a navigable canal from East Cottingwith to Street Bridge about a mile from Pocklington An early draft of this Parliamentary act was recently discovered in the attic of a Pocklington house By 1818 the Pocklington Canal linked Pocklington to the River Derwent It fell into disuse with the decline of Britains canals but has been continuously resurrected by the Pocklington Canal Amenity Society since 1971 and the old mill house is now classed as a Grade II listed water mill of historic interest most of the mill mechanism still exists

In 1821 the entire parish contained 2163 inhabitants of which 1962 were of the township of Pocklington itself

In 1868 Pocklingtons inhabitants are described as being for the most part employed in agricultural pursuits and in ropemaking brickmaking brewing and malting There are besides corn mills iron foundries and agricultural implement manufactories which materially contribute to the industrial wealth of the town

In 1890 extensive repairs and alterations were made to All Saints Church and in a foreshadowing of modern interest in time capsules a message detailing the work was sealed in a glass bottle along with an 1890 newspaper and buried underneath the plith of the medieval Sotheby Cross Unearthed accidentally during repairs in 2005 the sealed message and a copy of the 1890 newspaper were reburied in the same spot along with a contemporary copy of the Pocklington Post

The group of five airfields based in and around Pocklington played an active role in the Second World War Pocklington Airfield was completed in April 1941 The first operational unit to occupy Pocklington was the Canadian No 405 Squadron with Wellington aircraft but in 1942 the RAFs 102 Ceylon Squadron took over the airfield flying night sorties to bomb targets in France They still hold an annual reunion in Pocklington It was disbanded on 20 October 1954

During the Second World War a few houses in Pocklington were subject to bombing after their street was mistaken for the airfield

Those serving on HMS Volage also keep close ties with the town that adopted them during the war sending letters and parcels The association with Pocklington continues with a new housing estate being named Volage Court in recognition of the links with HMS Volage

Pocklington used to be served by a railway connection but this was closed in the Beeching Report era of the 1960s Some existing lengths of trackway can be seen behind the old railway station now used as the sports hall for Pocklington School There has been some talk of bringing the railway line back to Pocklington but there has been substantial development along the original line after the land was sold off and the original route is no longer practical There are serious doubts also as to the financial feasibility of reopening the line

Pocklington experienced a rapid expansion in the final two decades of the 20thcentury with large amounts of green land being ceded to new housing development to meet the demands of both lower housing occupancy rates a trend common across the country and also demand for commuter belt housing for the cities of York and Leeds

Throughout its long history Pocklington has faced difficult times like recession wartime and the closing of the railway but each time the town has overcome and gone on to develop further

East Yi West Xia
East Yi West Xia  is an obsolete theory about the origin of prehistory culture in current China which says that the culture of Shang dynasty was established by two ethnic groups namely that the Western part of the Shang dynasty was developed by Xia ethnic group and the eastern part of Shang dynasty was developed by Yi ethnic group

This theory was suggested by future linguist Fu Sinian in his thesis 1933 It was further expanded by Liang Siyong who suggested that the newly discovered Yangshao culture was established by the Xia in the west and the Longshan culture by the Yi peoples of the east For Chinese and Western historians this hypothesis became the prevailing theory to interpret Chinese prehistory and remained so until about 1960

Further archaeological discoveries made the theory obsolete In 1950s it became clear that the Yinxu culture was preceded by the Erligang culture in Zhongyuan In addition the gap between the Erligang culture and the Longshan culture was joined by the Erlitou culture which was named after the Erlitou site discovered in 1959 Chinese scholars identify the Erligang and Erlitou cultures as the sites of the Shang and Xia Dynasties respectively although the archaeological boundary between the two dynasties was still debatable In 1983 the ruin of Yanshi Shang City was discovered and identified as the Erligang culture The ruin very close to the Erlitou site suggests that the Erlitou and Erligang cultures were dominated by people with different cultural background

In Shandong the Shandong Longshan culture was replaced by the Yueshi culture around 2000 BC The sites of the Yueshi culture show complementary distribution with those of the Erligang culture which expanded eastward from Zhongyuan It proved that the Shang people did not originated in the east

Though largely modified by further research Fu Sinians theory entered the history as a landmark in Chinese historiography It essentially questioned ethnic homogeneity sometimes postulated as the route of Chinese civilization This contributed to the concept of the dialogical development of cultures

Conocarpus lancifolius
Conocarpus lancifolius one of two species in the genus Conocarpus is a tree in the family Combretaceae native to coastal and riverine areas of Somalia Djibouti and Yemen It is found throughout the Horn of Africa the Arabian peninsula and South Asia

The tree has no common name in English In Somali it is called qalab in Arabic the name is damas It is also commonly found in residential compounds in Dubai

The trees wood is dense and suitable for charcoal Goats use the young trees and shoots as fodder although the leaves contain tannin Because of its high salt tolerance and relative drought tolerance the tree is sometimes planted as a pioneer species in reafforestation projects in its native habitat The tree has a symmetrical growth habit and can easily be shaped into a variety of different forms It can be shaped into short and tall hedges and is effective for creating a visual or a noise barrier With suitable plant spacing it can also be grown as a hardy singlestemmed tree which is good for shade The tree has been extensively used in Karachi for landscaping along roads and by homeowners as a tall hedging tree for screening purposes The tree thrives exceptionally well in the hot and dry climate of the city

Kryptopterus cryptopterus
Kryptopterus cryptopterus blue sheatfish is a species of catfish the type species of the genus Kryptopterus It can be distinguished from all its congeners with the exception of the newly split Kryptopterus geminus by the almost flat dorsal profile with no concavity behind the head This species grows to a length of SL

This distinctively shaped translucent fish is found in Peninsular Malaysia Borneo and Sumatra Specimens from Cambodia Laos Thailand and Vietnam previously assigned to this species are now recognized as a separate species K geminus K cryptopterus can be distinguished from this close relative by its broader head shorter snout shorter anal fin and eyes located much more ventrally

In Thailand it is one of the catfish species known in the markets as Pla Nuea On  highly valued as food in the local cuisine for its delicate flesh This fish is also often used for making fish balls

Metaphor Computer Systems
Metaphor Computer Systems 19821994 was a Xerox PARC spinoff that created an advanced workstation database gateway a unique graphical office interface and software applications that communicate The Metaphor machine was one of the first commercial workstations to offer a complete hardwaresoftware package and a GUI Although the company achieved some commercial success it never achieved the fame of either the Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows

David Liddle and Donald Massaro founded Metaphor in 1982 after leaving Xerox PARC By 1987 the company had an annual revenue of 397 million In 1991 IBM one of its primary customers acquired the company outright

The Metaphor workstation had a wireless keyboard wireless mouse wireless numeric pad and a wireless 5function keypad All these input devices docked in the desktop workstation where they were recharged Objects on the desktop and open applications had a uniform command set that could be controlled by the keypad which had Copy Move Delete Options and Size Workstations were connected with Ethernet The industrial design of the workstation was done by Mike Nutall of Matrix Product Design It won a gold medal from the IDSA The workstation itself was engineered by James Yurchenco at David Kelley Design Both Matrix and David Kelley Design were precursors of IDEO

Two different workstations models were produced Workstation One had an external electronics enclosure Workstation Two had integrated electronics A Workstation Three which included a color screen was designed through final prototypes but was never taken into production

Xerox PARC in 1973 began development of the Alto widely shown in 1979 The Alto was the first computer with a bitmap display mouse and a desktop metaphor as a graphical user interface GUI Xerox commercialized it as the Xerox Star

The Metaphor GUI provided a unique visualization of endtoend elements in an enterprise In total Metaphor branded this as a Data Interpretation System DIS which is a class of Decision Support System DSS 
The DIS software was designed to show in one workflow the access of data from SQL databases its analysis and then its presentation This was accomplish by using graphically iconic applications for database gateway spreadsheet plot email and printing tools all connected by arrows These were animated when the workflow ran The workflow collection was called a Capsule

The heart of the Metaphor DIS system was the Capsule Basically a capsule was a simplified BATCH program Because Metaphor applications were built so they communicated with each other they could be moved into a folder and automated in a Capsule The name was taken from the manned space capsules of the time

The functionality of the Word Processor Spreadsheet and Data Retrieval tools were no better than their Microsoft Office counterparts in fact they had a smaller subset of features than Office The primary advantage of Metaphors system was the degree to which applications were linked together Complex reiterative dataretrieval jobs were able to be created onthefly by a user with no programming knowledge

A user could visually drag fields from multiple databases into the Data Retrieval tool which would generate its own SQL code based on the fields links and criteria displayed and send the output directly into a spreadsheet for sorting calculations and graphs The report could then be sent into a preformatted Word Processing document sent to the printer and even emailed to a predesignated distribution list The whole process would repeat for each SKU Region Price Code etc without any human interaction

Even in todays GUI designs this abstract conception of the desktop has never been attempted because it requires the interoperation of every application a uniform dataflow model and a communication protocol usable by a supervisor in a programmatic way

In March 2000 IBM licensed the Metaphor IBM Intelligent Decision Server IDS technology to Relational Development Systems RDS which was renamed Meta5

Metaphor and IBM created a venture called Patriot Partners in 1990 The attempt was to create an organization that could produce a solid business line of objectoriented software Rather than capitalize the venture IBM purchased the Metaphor software division in 1991 and operated it as a wholly owned independent subsidiary and the hardware and field repair division was spun off into its own company Sequence Support Services In May 1992 Sequence Support Services ceased operations In October 1994 Metaphor ceased operations

Hurricane Dean 1989
Hurricane Dean was the fourth named storm and second hurricane of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season Dean formed on July 31 and reached tropical storm status the following day east of the Leeward Islands Dean brushed the northern Leeward Islands as a Category 1 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson Hurricane Scale bringing light rain but producing no damage before turning northward and striking Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane Dean continued northward before making landfall in southeastern Newfoundland

Since Dean was initially difficult to forecast it posed a possible threat to the Lesser Antilles as a result several evacuations occurred and many hurricane watches and warning were issued However as Dean turned northward all watches and warnings in the Lesser Antilles were discontinued As Dean approached Bermuda a hurricane watch was issued and was later upgraded to a hurricane warning After Dean tracked away from the island the hurricane warning was discontinued In addition a hurricane warning was briefly in effect for Sable Island Nova Scotia The storm left 89million 1989USD  USD and sixteen injuries across Bermuda but no fatalities were reported In Atlantic Canada Dean dropped light rain across Nova Scotia and Sable Island

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified using the Dvorak Technique by satellite analysts at the National Hurricane Center in part due to persistent deep convection Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles The depression moved westward at 17mph 28kmh intensifying as it did so and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm which was named Dean by the National Hurricane Center

Continuing generally westward Dean continued to gradually intensify and became a hurricane on August 2 after an Air Force reconnaissance flight had recorded hurricaneforce winds The following day a decreasing ridge of high pressure to the north and a trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States caused Dean to slow in its forward motion and turn northwest The trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States was deepening causing Dean to curve northward while remaining nearly stationary After remaining nearly stationary Dean began to accelerate to a forward speed of 17mph 28kmh as it headed toward Bermuda Thereafter Dean intensified into a Category 2 hurricane whilst the eastern half of the eyewall brushed Bermuda Dean continued to intensify slightly after passing the island of Bermuda and became a Category 2 hurricane on August 7 While Dean was a Category 2 hurricane it attained its peak intensity with winds of 105mph 165kmh and a minimum pressure of 968mbar hPa 2859inHg

After peak intensity the forward speed of Dean continued to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane While approaching southern Newfoundland Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8 Shortly thereafter Dean then made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65mph 105kmh Later that day Dean emerged into the far north Atlantic and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day

Hurricane Dean was very difficult to forecast in its early stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands the track prediction models were not consistent and as a result uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays

Regardless the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings for Guadeloupe on August 2 and the rest of the Leeward Islands extending to the Virgin Islands The uncertainty of the hurricanes forecast track forced residents and tourists in the Lesser Antilles to evacuate In the British Virgin Islands 80 American and Canadian tourists evacuated to hotels In Puerto Rico residents were advised to secure or stow away loose objects and stock up on emergency supplies 11million residents in the city of San Juan went to supermarkets to get much needed supplies in anticipation that the storm might hit Puerto Rico In Humacao the National Guard evacuated 1966 people living along a coastal highway The islands of Martinique and Dominica were placed under a hurricane watch The warning for Guadeloupe was discontinued at 2200 UTC when the hurricane posed no threat to the island Simultaneously the hurricane watches in effect for Martinique and Dominica were also discontinued As Dean continued westward the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands The watch was soon canceled as Dean made its northward turn towards Bermuda

In Bermuda the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch on August 5 The hurricane watch was later changed to a hurricane warning the following day Deans approach to the island canceled numerous inbound and outbound flights In Atlantic Canada the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for Nova Scotia and Sable Island while the Canadian forecasters issued a high wind advisory

The outer bands of Hurricane Dean produced heavy rainfall and winds up to 75mph 121kmh across Antigua and Barbuda There was no reported damage in the Leeward Islands or the Virgin Islands since the hurricane turned northward In the Atlantic a sailboat bound for Bermuda was caught off guard by the hurricane The boat which carried no radio equipment was spotted by a hurricane hunter plane The occupants of the boat suffered no injuries In Bermuda the hurricanes eastern eyewall produced 81mph 130kmh sustained winds with gusts up to 113mph 182kmh Bermuda highest rainfall total from Dean was 245in 508mm while parts of the island received 35in 762127mm of rain

Strong winds from Hurricane Dean caused considerable power line damage leaving 65000 residents without electricity The winds also caused minor roof damage In Hamilton Harbor 20 pleasure boats were damaged or sent adrift due to the rough seas Flooding from the hurricane damaged fifteen houses Sixteen people were injured by the hurricane five of the injuries were considered serious There were however no reports of fatalities from Deans impact on Bermuda Damage in Bermuda amounted up to 89million 1989USD  USD

Although Dean remained away from the United States coastline it produced storm tides of 17ft 051m to North Carolina In Atlantic Canada hurricaneforce winds were reported in Nova Scotia and Sable Island Newfoundland reported winds of only 50mph 80kmh Moderate rainfall was reported on Newfoundland with most areas of the island experiencing at least 1in 254mm of precipitation Rainfall on Newfoundland peaked at 27in 6858mm on the south coast of the island near the location of Deans landfall A majority of rainfall was reported on the west side of Dean but minimal precipitation had been recorded to the east of the storm High winds were reported on the eastern side of the storm however with lighter winds along the western quadrants of Dean Offshore waves up to 26ft 792m were reported and Sable Island reported rainfall of 059in 15mm Although there were no reports of damage in Atlantic Canada from Hurricane Dean three sailors had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard when their boat got dismasted during the storm

Prlwytzkofsky
Prlwytzkofsky is a fictional written variant of the Dutch language based on the idiolect of the PolishGerman Professor Zbigniew Prlwytzkofsky sometimes spelled Prlwytzkofski as featured in the Tom Puss Tom Poes in Dutch and Oliver B Bumble Olivier B Bommel in Dutch series by Marten Toonder

The Professor uses several wellknown catchphrases

The language is characterised by an abundance of composite words built on the combination of words literally translated from German but in a small number of cases including a Slavic word Often the particular combination in Dutch may create a hint or an echo of a totally unconnected word For instance mislinger loserfailure a person combines the Dutch word mis miss  wrong failure with the German word gelingen succeed creating a word which hints at slinger pendulum or festoon The actual Dutch word is mislukkeling Professor Prlwytzkofsky calls disturbed brains verhoornde hersenschors  horned cerebral cortex Verhoornd horned rhymes with verstoord disturbed which is the meaning here but actually translates the German word for brain which is Gehirn Without knowledge of the German word one may be led to think that the phrase refers to the brains of a cuckold

A Slavic influence is obvious in Prlwytzkofsky calling his assistant Alexander Pieps a mouse Irkoetsk shortstatured assistant who always manages to do things in the wrong way but of course also referring to the Siberian town

Clearest examples of Germanization are

but since all words not of the female sex but ending in a consonant or diphthong take Der as their article this also hides a Slavic substratum and simplifies the Prlwytzkofsky gender system compared to Dutch and German

Magnetic domain
A magnetic domain is a region within a magnetic material in which the magnetization is in a uniform direction This means that the individual magnetic moments of the atoms are aligned with one another and they point in the same direction When cooled below a temperature called the Curie temperature the magnetization of a piece of ferromagnetic material spontaneously divides into many small regions called magnetic domains The magnetization within each domain points in a uniform direction but the magnetization of different domains may point in different directions Magnetic domain structure is responsible for the magnetic behavior of ferromagnetic materials like iron nickel cobalt and their alloys and ferrimagnetic materials like ferrite This includes the formation of permanent magnets and the attraction of ferromagnetic materials to a magnetic field The regions separating magnetic domains are called domain walls where the magnetization rotates coherently from the direction in one domain to that in the next domain The study of magnetic domains is called micromagnetics

Magnetic domains form in materials which have magnetic ordering that is their dipoles spontaneously align due to the exchange interaction These are the ferromagnetic ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials in which the dipoles align in response to an external field but do not spontaneously align do not have magnetic domains

Magnetic domain theory was developed by French physicist PierreErnest Weiss who in 1906 suggested existence of magnetic domains in ferromagnets He suggested that large number of atomic magnetic moments typically 1010 were aligned parallel The direction of alignment varies from domain to domain in a more or less random manner although certain crystallographic axis may be preferred by the magnetic moments called easy axes Weiss still had to explain the reason for the spontaneous alignment of atomic moments within a ferromagnetic material and he came up with the socalled Weiss mean field He assumed that a given magnetic moment in a material experienced a very high effective magnetic field due to the magnetization of its neighbors In the original Weiss theory the mean field was proportional to the bulk magnetization M so that

formula1

where formula2 is the mean field constant However this is not applicable to ferromagnets due to the variation of magnetization from domain to domain In this case the interaction field is

formula3

Where formula4 is the saturation magnetization at 0K

Later the quantum theory made it possible to understand the microscopic origin of the Weiss field The exchange interaction between localized spins favored a parallel in ferromagnets or an antiparallel in antiferromagnets state of neighboring magnetic moments

The reason a piece of magnetic material such as iron spontaneously divides into separate domains rather than exist in a state with magnetization in the same direction throughout the material is to minimize its internal energy A large region of ferromagnetic material with a constant magnetization throughout will create a large magnetic field extending into the space outside itself diagram a right This requires a lot of magnetostatic energy stored in the field To reduce this energy the sample can split into two domains with the magnetization in opposite directions in each domain diagram b right The magnetic field lines pass in loops in opposite directions through each domain reducing the field outside the material To reduce the field energy further each of these domains can split also resulting in smaller parallel domains with magnetization in alternating directions with smaller amounts of field outside the material

The domain structure of actual magnetic materials does not usually form by the process of large domains splitting into smaller ones as described here When a sample is cooled below the Curie temperature for example the equilibrium domain configuration simply appears But domains can split and the description of domains splitting is often used to reveal the energy tradeoffs in domain formation

As explained above a domain which is too big is unstable and will divide into smaller domains But a small enough domain will be stable and will not split and this determines the size of the domains created in a material This size depends on the balance of several energies within the material Each time a region of magnetization splits into two domains it creates a domain wall between the domains where magnetic dipoles molecules with magnetization pointing in different directions are adjacent The exchange interaction which creates the magnetization is a force which tends to align nearby dipoles so they point in the same direction Forcing adjacent dipoles to point in different directions requires energy Therefore a domain wall requires extra energy called the domain wall energy which is proportional to the area of the wall

Thus the net amount that the energy is reduced when a domain splits is equal to the difference between the magnetic field energy saved and the additional energy required to create the domain wall The field energy is proportional to the cube of the domain size while the domain wall energy is proportional to the square of the domain size So as the domains get smaller the net energy saved by splitting decreases The domains keep dividing into smaller domains until the energy cost of creating an additional domain wall is just equal to the field energy saved Then the domains of this size are stable In most materials the domains are microscopic in size around 10  10 m 

An additional way for the material to further reduce its magnetostatic energy is to form domains with magnetization at right angles to the other domains diagram c right instead of just in opposing parallel directions These domains called flux closure domains allow the field lines to turn 180 within the material forming closed loops entirely within the material reducing the magnetostatic energy to zero However forming these domains incurs two additional energy costs First the crystal lattice of most magnetic materials has magnetic anisotropy which means it has an easy direction of magnetization parallel to one of the crystal axes Changing the magnetization of the material to any other direction takes additional energy called the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy

The other energy cost to creating domains with magnetization at an angle to the easy direction is caused by the phenomenon called magnetostriction When the magnetization of a piece of magnetic material is changed to a different direction it causes a slight change in its shape The change in magnetic field causes the magnetic dipole molecules to change shape slightly making the crystal lattice longer in one dimension and shorter in other dimensions However since the magnetic domain is squished in with its boundaries held rigid by the surrounding material it cannot actually change shape So instead changing the direction of the magnetization induces tiny mechanical stresses in the material requiring more energy to create the domain This is called magnetoelastic anisotropy energy

To form these closure domains with sideways magnetization requires additional energy due to the aforementioned two factors So flux closure domains will only form where the magnetostatic energy saved is greater than the sum of the exchange energy to create the domain wall the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and the magnetoelastic anisotropy energy Therefore most of the volume of the material is occupied by domains with magnetization either up or down along the easy direction and the flux closure domains only form in small areas at the edges of the other domains where they are needed to provide a path for magnetic field lines to change direction diagram c above

The above describes magnetic domain structure in a perfect crystal lattice such as would be found in a single crystal of iron However most magnetic materials are polycrystalline composed of microscopic crystalline grains These grains are not the same as domains Each grain is a little crystal with the crystal lattices of separate grains oriented in random directions In most materials each grain is big enough to contain several domains Each crystal has an easy axis of magnetization and is divided into domains with the axis of magnetization parallel to this axis in alternate directions

It can be seen that although on a microscopic scale almost all the magnetic dipoles in a piece of ferromagnetic material are lined up parallel to their neighbors in domains creating strong local magnetic fields energy minimization results in a domain structure that minimizes the largescale magnetic field The magnetization of neighboring domains point in different directions confining the field lines to microscopic loops between neighboring domains within the material so the combined fields cancel at a distance Therefore a bulk piece of ferromagnetic material in its lowest energy state has little or no external magnetic field The material is said to be unmagnetized

However the domains can also exist in other configurations in which their magnetization mostly points in the same direction creating an external magnetic field Although these are not minimum energy configurations due to a phenomenon where the domain walls become pinned to defects in the crystal lattice they can be local minimums of the energy and therefore can be very stable Applying an external magnetic field to the material can make the domain walls move causing the domains aligned with the field to grow and the opposing domains to shrink When the external field is removed the domain walls remain pinned in their new orientation and the aligned domains produce a magnetic field This is what happens when a piece of ferromagnetic material is magnetized and becomes a permanent magnet

Heating a magnet subjecting it to vibration by hammering it or applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field from a degaussing coil tends to pull the domain walls free from their pinned states and they will return to a lower energy configuration with less external magnetic field thus demagnetizing the material

The contributions of the different internal energy factors described above is expressed by the free energy equation proposed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz in 1935 which forms the basis of the modern theory of magnetic domains The domain structure of a material is the one which minimizes the Gibbs free energy of the material For a crystal of magnetic material this is the LandauLifshitz free energy E which is the sum of these energy terms

where

Some sources define a wall energy E equal to the sum of the exchange energy and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy which replaces E and E in the above equation

A stable domain structure is a magnetization function Mx considered as a continuous vector field which minimizes the total energy E throughout the material To find the minimums a variational method is used resulting in a set of nonlinear differential equations called Browns equations after William Fuller Brown Jr Although in principle these equations can be solved for the stable domain configurations Mx in practice only the simplest examples can be solved Analytic solutions do not exist and numerical solutions calculated by the finite element method are computationally intractable because of the large difference in scale between the domain size and the wall size Therefore micromagnetics has evolved approximate methods which assume that the magnetization of dipoles in the bulk of the domain away from the wall all point in the same direction and numerical solutions are only used near the domain wall where the magnetization is changing rapidly

There are a number of microscopy methods that can be used to visualize the magnetization at the surface of a magnetic material revealing the magnetic domains Each method has a different application because not all domains are the same In magnetic materials domains can be circular square irregular elongated and striped all of which have varied sizes and dimensions

Large domains within the range of 25100 micrometers can be easily seen by Kerr microscopy which uses the magnetooptic Kerr effect which is the rotation of the polarization of light reflected from a magnetized surface

Lorentz microscopy is a transmission electron microscopy technique used to study magnetic domain structures at very high resolution Offaxis electron holography is a related technique used to observe magnetic structures by detecting nanoscale magnetic fields

Another technique for viewing submicroscopic domain structures down to a scale of a few nanometers is magnetic force microscopy MFM is a form of atomic force microscopy that uses a magnetically coated probe tip to scan the sample surface

Bitter patterns are a technique for imaging magnetic domains that were first observed by Francis Bitter The technique involves placing a small quantity of ferrofluid on the surface of a ferromagnetic material The ferrofluid arranges itself along magnetic domain walls which have higher magnetic flux than the regions of the material located within domains
A modified Bitter technique has been incorporated into a widely used device the Large Area Domain Viewer which is particularly useful in the examination of grainoriented silicon steels

Stenhouse Bay South Australia
Stenhouse Bay is a place in the Australian state of South Australia near the southwest extremity of the Yorke Peninsula located in the gazetted locality of Inneston about west of the state capital of Adelaide 

Stenhouse Bay was named after Andrew Stenhouse who was a principal of the Permasite Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd which held leases for the harvesting of gypsum north of Cape Spencer

Since 1999 it has been located within the locality of Inneston
Its official status as of 2013 is that of a locality unbounded which is listed on the South Australian place name gazetteer with the advice that it is not to be used as an address 

The Waratah Gypsum Company had works here for the quarrying and exporting of rock gypsum Gypsum after being washed roasted and ground was used in the manufacturing of plaster of paris and cement The quality of the gypsum in this area was exceptionally high class and most of Australias needs were supplied from here

The Waratah Gypsum Company closed its works and the town was sold to the South Australian Government which demolished the town except for the few houses required for the rangers of the National Parks and Wildlife Organization who look after Innes National Park

Stenhouse Bay has been the site of an automatic weather station since 20 November 1995

After almost 60 years the shop at Stenhouse Bay trading in recent years as Innes Park Trading Post and Rhinos Tavern was demolished before Christmas in 2013 

The iconic trading post and tavern was closed and fenced off just before the peak Christmas period Park visitors must now travel 5km out of the park back to Marion Bay for fuel camping goods and a restaurant meal The closure meant the department lost between 30000 and 50000 in annual lease revenue

In 1921 Camp Midvale was founded as a haven for working people seeking refuge recreation community and nature by a group of outdoor enthusiasts called the Nature Friends Naturfreunde In 1935 Nature Friends volunteers carved the present swimming pool out of the hillside by hand 

In 1974 the Metropolitan Recreation Association a successor group of the Nature Friends donated the Camp Midvale property to the Ethical Culture Society because they were unable to financially maintain it and most of the wooded area of over was placed under the New Jersey Green Acres program to be preserved from development in perpetuity 

Ethical Culture members Walter and May Weis endowed money to the remaining developed part of the property in order to realize their dream of preserving land for the purpose of environmental education Thus the Weis Ecology Center WEC a private nonprofit organization was created to offer the public a unique opportunity to learn about the Northern New Jersey Highlands Region 

The WEC was then taken over by the New Jersey Audubon Society who closed the pool in 1994 

In 1995 New Jersey Audubon agreed to allow the community to open the pool and in 1996 The Community Association of the Highlands incorporated reopening the site as the Highlands Natural Pool In 1998 NJASWEC formally donated the pool to the community

Hawala scandal
The Hawala scandal also called the Jain Diaries case or the hawala scam was an Indian political and financial scandal involving payments allegedly sent by politicians black money through four hawala brokers namely the Jain brothers It was a US18 million bribery scandal that implicated some of the countrys leading politicians It also led to a fixed tenure of minimum 2 years for CBI Directors to prevent politicians from interfering with the Directors duties

In 1991 an arrest linked to militants in Kashmir led to a raid on hawala brokers revealing evidence of largescale payments to national politicians On 25 March 1991 as per the court proceedings published by the Supreme court of India Ashfak Hussain Lone a person alleged to be an official of the terrorist organisation Hizbul Mujahideen was arrested in Delhi During his interrogation the police learnt that his organisation was funded through hawala using Surendra Kumar Jain and his family as a conduit Based on this and further information received during Lones interrogation the Central Bureau of Investigation CBI conducted raids on the premises of Surrender Kumar Jain his brothers relations and businesses During the raids the CBI seized Indian and foreign currency two diaries and two note books at the premises These diaries contained detailed accounts of vast payments made to people identified only by initials The initials corresponded to the initials of high ranking politicians both in power and out of power and of high ranking bureaucrats At this stage the investigation stopped at the CBI and neither the Jains nor the contents of their diaries were investigated by the CBI Meanwhile officers of the CBI involved in the investigation were transferred out to other places by orders from ruling politicians However the case continued to make headlines in the newspapers media as it was pursued by a few journalists

On 4 October 1993 writ petitions were filed at the Supreme court of India in the public interest under Article 32 of the Constitution of the India These contained allegations that Government agencies like the CBI and the revenue authorities had failed to perform their duties and legal obligations as they had failed to investigate matters arising out of the seizure of the Jan diaries that the apprehension of terrorists had led to the discovery of financial support to them by clandestine and illegal means using tainted funds obtained through havala transactions that this had also disclosed a nexus between politicians bureaucrats and criminals who were recipients of money from unlawful sources given for unlawful consideration that the CBI and other Government agencies had failed to investigate the matter take it to its logical conclusion and prosecute all persons who were found to have committed and offence that this was done with a view to protect the persons involved who were very influential and powerful that the matter disclosed a nexus between crime and corruption at high places in public life and it posed a serious threat to the integrity security and economy of the nation that probity in public life the rule of law and the preservation of democracy required that the Government agencies the compelled to duly perform their legal obligations and to proceed in accordance with law against every person involved irrespective of where he was placed in the political hierarchy In India the Havala method is an illegal method of transacting in foreign currency It is illegal and contentious due to two reasons Firstly it is highly secretive as it does not reveal the identity of people on either side of the transaction even to the havala operators Secondly it violates the FERA regulations of India as it does not use approved channels of regular banks for foreign currency transactions However it is often used in India for two reasons Firstly to transfer legally earned salaries example  by ordinary workers overseas in Saudi Arabia and UAE to their hometowns as hawala transaction costs are a fraction of banks and havala operators can be found in the smallest villages of India Secondly by politicians bureaucrats and nefarious elements to transfer corruption money

Those accused included L K Advani V C Shukla P Shiv Shankar Sharad Yadav Balram Jakhar and Madan Lal Khurana The entire list contained politicians from the BJP Congress and independent MLAs and MPs with amounts varying between Rs 50000 to Rs 75 crore The prosecution that followed was partly prompted by a public interest petition see Vineet Narain and yet the court cases of the Hawala scandal eventually all collapsed without convictions Many were acquitted in 1997 and 1998 partly because the hawala records including diaries were judged in court to be inadequate as the main evidence The Central Bureau of Investigations role was criticised In concluding the Vineet Narain case the Supreme Court of India directed that the Central Vigilance Commission should be given a supervisory role over the CBI

The supreme court proceeding did not relate to the hawala case per se but rather to the suspicious transfer of the CBI Director Joginder Singh and the rampant misuse of political power to curb the investigations of the CBI and Revenue department In its judgment delivered on 18 December 1997 the court through judges SPBharucha and SCSen gave a ruling consisting of a 26 points list of pronouncements the most important of which made it impossible for politicians in the government to remove the Director of the CBI for 2 years thus ensuring that the CBI and its officers would have freedom to carry out their work without political interference

The Jain Hawala story was broken by two Delhibased journalists Ram Bahadur Rai and Rajesh Joshi working for the Hindi daily Jansatta Then Vineet Narain the journalist filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme court of India

The Association of ScienceTechnology Centers ASTC is a nonprofit global organization based in Washington DC United States that provides a collective voice professional support and programming opportunities for science centers museums and related institutions Through strategic alliances and global partnerships ASTCs goal is to increase awareness of the valuable contributions its members make to their communities and the field of informal STEM learning

Founded in 1973 ASTC now represents approximately 650 members in nearly 50 countries including not only science centers and museums but also nature centers aquariums planetariums zoos botanical gardens and natural history and childrens museums as well as companies consultants and other organizations that share an interest in informal science education

Science centers connect people with science give science a presence in the community and offer people of all ages and backgrounds the opportunity to ask questions discuss and explore

Science centers provide firsthand experience and an opportunity to develop intuitions about the natural world In science centers handson activities may include things such as feeling infrared radiation and experiencing angular momentumso when they encounter these concepts in other settings theyll be likelier to understand Many schools rely on science centers for memorable field trips and auditorium programs handson curriculum science kits and teacher training

Science centers also encourage curiosity In the words of Frank Oppenheimer founder of San Franciscos Exploratorium No one flunks a museum For some the interests awakened by science center experiences have turned into a passion for science and the beginning of a lifetime devoted to teaching or research

ASTCs goal is to support these efforts of science centers and museums in addition to their staff visitors and communities

Some ASTC member institutions also participate in ASTCs Passport Program The Passport Program allows members of a participating institution to visit other participating institutions for free provided the member is visiting an institution more than 90 miles from their home institution More than 300 institutions in over a dozen countries are currently participating in the Passport Program

Atan Burhagohain
Atan Burhagohain Assamese    was one of the most influential Burhagohains in the nearly 600 years of the Ahom kingdom Atan Burhagohain Rajmantri Dangaria was the Prime Minister of Assam for more than seventeen years from January 1662 to March 1679 During this period Assam passed through a series of crises in the form of foreign invasions and internal disruptions and Atan Burhagohain conducted the affairs with rare foresight probity judgment and patriotism The versatile qualities of the Burhagoain and the proof that he gave of his lofty and noble ideals made him the darling of the people Kings potentates and the populace were united in showering tokens of their admiration and respect on this man of their countrys destiny Twice the crown was offered to him which he did twice refuse saying It does not behove a minister to become a monarch kingship should go to the scion of a royal family and saintship to the descendant of a saint

He was appointed as the Prime Minister in January 1662 at the time Garhgaon was occupied by Mir Jumla He oversaw the military resistance to the Mughal general negotiated the Treaty of Ghilajharighat planned the rejuvenation of the Ahom kingdom and was one of the architects of the Ahom victory at the Battle of Saraighat He was known for his military tactics of guerrilla warfare that came to be known as daga juddha and also for his statesmanship and wise counsel He was appointed the Rajmantri Dangaria Prime Minister by the Ahom king Chakradhwaj Singha and in the turmoil following the excesses of Debera Borbarua he was offered the Ahom throne itself which he refused Despite his wisdom and keen political sense he was unable to see through the treachery of Laluk Sola Borphukan and was murdered by the Borphukans henchmen in 1679

According to the Buranjis the Burhagohain was tall in stature and his strides resembled that of a goose His face was broad and he had two moles on the forehead He was ruddy in complexion He wore a buffalocoloured gati or a cloth tightly wrapped round the body with two ends made into a knot near the waist and he carried a big hengdang or sword Since he belonged to the Bahgaria clan he is generally referred to as Bahgaria Atan Burhagohain

Atan Burhagohain was one of the key people in the victory of the Assamese in the Battle of Saraighat The Prime Minister was personally in charge of the command of the northern division of the Ahom army on the north bank of Guwahati His camp was situated at Lathia Parvat and he had with him 80 chorbachas or commando soldiers in his Pali meaning a unit of command under a commander in Assamese

From his base at Lathia fort he initiated a campaign of guerrilla attacks on the Mughals employing many well known commandos Lai Lechai Chili Mabi Mari Achor Tunai Baduli and other spies who entered the enemys camps at night and removed their treasures money and disabled their arms

Atan Burhagohain was also a highly skilled military engineer and after the occupation of Gauhati he was directed by the King to oversee the construction of the necessary fortifications on both banks of Brahmaputra Before the final Saraighat battle on seeing the fortification and preparation of the Ahom army Raja Ram Singha commented to his lieutenant Rashid Khan
This conversation was communicated to the Ahoms by a traveller named Hangalbhanga Laskar On hearing this the Premier Atan Burhagohain promulgated this message to the army

Atan Burhagohain was not only a highly trained soldier he was also an able administrator and astute statesman Immediately upon ascending the throne King Chakradhwaj Singha was impatient and contemplated immediate attack on the Mughal forces He pleaded with the King that such attack would be suicidal that first they should properly train the army build the armory stock food provisions and other war material as the hostilities may continue for a number of years He addressed the king and his councillors on this occasion

He said sakalo dravyat thaki chaul kotha he prodhan rice is the most indispensable and important of all the items Long before Napoleon stated that an Army marches on its stomach Atan Burhagohain had realised this and convinced his king to make necessary preparations

Atan Burhagohain further pleaded

Atan Burhagohain also advised to have the boatsmen and oarsmen trained
The counsel of Prime Minister Atan Burhagohain roused the monarch to a consciousness of the realities of the situation and extensive preparation was made for two years before the onslaught on the Mughals

After the reoccupation of Gauhati by the Ahoms Atan Burhagohain was appointed by the king to erect the necessary fortifications on both banks of Brahmaputra strengthen them stock them with provisions and men Lachit Borphukan was asked to post a contingent of soldiers at each strategic point under an able commander Under the Premiers supervision the civil administration of Kamrup was reorganised on sound footing and Chaudhuris and Patwaries were appointed to realise the stipulated jaigiridhan or land revenue The administration of the parganas of Kamrup was vested under various senior officers Barphukan Darang Barbhag and Bangeswar Paniphukan Khata and Banbhag Duara Phukan Pubpar and Paschimpar Deka Phukan Sarubangsar and Kacharimahal Chetia Phukan Ramsa and Sarukhetri Dayangia Rajkhowa Bar Khetri TarSalagarua Rajkhowa Barhanti Dikhowmukhia Rajkhowa Chamaria PaniSalaguria Rajkhowa Nagarberha PaniDihingia Rajkhowa Bagaribari TaruaDihingia Rajkhowa Barpeta Namdangia Rajkhowa Barnagar PaniAbhoypuria Rajkhowa Bajali BarAbhoypuria Rajkhowa Bekeli and SaruAbhoypuria Rajkhowa Bausi

During the war Raja Ram Singha asked his envoy Panditrai
To this Panditrai replied
Ram Singha commented It is really wonderful that a man can be so intelligent at this tender age Panditrai added The Burhagohain is also an archdiplomat Ram Singha concluded Who will be able to cope with such a minister when he comes to years Pride should be the heritage of that land where such a counsellor has taken his birth

Earl Fitzwilliams private railway
Earl Fitzwilliams private railway near Rotherham South Yorkshire was constructed in order to link the Earls coal interests to the southeast of his Wentworth estate with the Greasbrough Canal also owned by his estate which gave an outlet to the River Dun Don Navigation 

This was not the first connection between the coal pits at that time owned by the Marquess of Rockingham and the canal for in the middle years of the 18th century a wagonway had been built to link the Bassingthorpe pits to the newly opened Rotherham Cut of the River Dun Navigation The Greasbrough Canal connecting to the navigation on the boundaries of Rotherham and Parkgate was opened in 1780 to serve the Marquesss interests and the wagonways from his coal pits at Bassingthorpe were diverted to the canal head Two years later the Marquess died and the estate passed to his nephew Earl Fitzwilliam

The Earl owned coal pits at High Stubbin and Swallow Wood and these pits were from the early 19th century joined by a wagonway to the Greasbrough Canal In 1839 the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway opened a branch from its main line at Holmes which had been opened the previous year to join with the Earls railway at Parkgate This line ran alongside the construction works of the North Midland Railway before joining the canal bank This connection broke the near monopoly of the Duke of Norfolks estate in supplying coal to the developing industries of the city and gave the Earls coal a competitive edge in the marketplace 

In 1840 the estate bought a sixcoupled steam locomotive for use on the line and to accommodate this the wagonway was rebuilt

A connection was made from the North Midland Railway to the Earls line which rendered the branch from Holmes redundant This connection was closed in 1977 a year before New Stubbin Colliery itself The Manchester Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway constructed a line from Rotherham Road alongside the canal and below the North Midland line to reach the canal head The line opened in 1873 and the agreement between the Earls Colliery Company and the MS L terminated on 31 December 1978 when the line closed 

In 1915 Viscount Halifax invested heavily into improvement of the rail line

The line can be divided into two sections both originally ropeworked The lower section serving New Stubbin Colliery sunk between 1913 and 1915 changed to locomotive working

Its last steam locomotives were two examples built by Hudswell Clarke  Co of Leeds No 34 an outside cylinder sixcoupled side tank locomotive works No1523 built in 1925 and delivered new to the ApplebyFrodingham Steel Company in Scunthorpe which came to the line in the 1950s and No 37 an outside cylinder sixcoupled saddle tank They worked until the mid1960s when the line became fully dieselised Hudswell Clarke again supplying the power

Trouble Cat Stevens song
Trouble is a song written by the English singersongwriter and musician Cat Stevens during a period from 1969 to 1970 

Stevens was recovering during what amounted to nearly a year of convalescence after being diagnosed with a collapsed lung and tuberculosis He spent three months in King Edward VII Hospital Midhurst England transferring afterward to another nine months of bedrest at home Stevens who was near death at the time he was admitted in the hospital used the time he was recuperating for contemplation and wrote dozens of songs including Trouble many of which were recorded much later 

When he was hospitalized Stevens was often alone in a very spare and plain room He was told that at the time he was admitted he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him The effect on the 19yearold pop star was pronounced He said To go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital getting injections day in and day out and people around you are dying it certainly changes your perspective I got down to thinking about myself It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut The song itself shows Stevens switching from heavily orchestrated pop music to a folkrock emphasis

While recovering Stevens donated his spare time and some of his newer more introspective songs for Colin Higgins and Hal Ashbys 1971 film soundtrack of Harold and Maude Most of the tunes used for the movie appear on Stevenss next albums Mona Bone Jakon and Tea for the Tillerman with the exception of two songs which were not released until the release of the album  in 1984 If You Want to Sing Out Sing Out and Dont Be Shy

In Harold and Maude the song Trouble is used in the scene of Maudes impending death with her devoted young lover heartbroken over the turn of events

Dinny Meehan
Dennis L Meehan June 5 1889  March 31 1920 was the leader of the White Hand Gang in the 1910s Dinny Meehan was described by the police as the most desperate gang leader in Brooklyn 

Born in Brooklyn Meehan apparently joined the White Hand Gang in his late teens In 1912 he was arrested for shooting and killing Chris Maroney who led a faction of White Handers from the Navy Yard section of Brooklyn After a sensational trial Meehan was acquitted adding to his criminal reputation Over the years he had served time in the Elmira Reformatory Blackwells Island and the City Workhouse Dinny often boasted that he would never see the inside of a state penitentiary 

Unlike some crime bosses Dinny Meehan often joined his men on criminal jobs By 1920 there were a total of three cases pending against him he was out of jail on a 5000 bond for robbing a man on Fifth Avenue leading his men in the hijacking of a truckload of shoes worth 10000 and overseeing the theft of 10000 worth of silk from a Red Hook warehouse

On the afternoon of March 31 1920 Dinny Meehan and his wife Sadie were asleep in bed at their apartment at 452 Warren Street in Red Hook Their fouryearold son played in the living room while Sadies mother Rose Leighton dozed in a recliner Neither of them knew that five strange men were in the apartment until the last second As the men made for the bedroom the young boy admonished them not to wake his parents The leader of the group playfully patted the youngsters head and said they just wanted to look in A total of five shots were fired one passed through Dinny Meehans head and then lodged in the shoulder of his wife who later recovered from her wounds The gunmen dashed from the building and made their escape in an automobile truck 

Meehans murder has been traditionally thought to have been arranged by Brooklyn Black Hand boss Frankie Yale and carried out by Yales underboss Augie Pisano and two hitmen from Cleveland Ralph DeSarno and Giovanni Sciacca At the time of the killing however police believed that a possible motive was the gang leaders role in supplying strikebreakers to take the places of employees of the United Fruit Company on piers along the Hudson and East Rivers These employees had recently walked out when their demands for higher wages were turned down The arrest of a Frank Madden an associate of the International Longshoremens Association Local 856 and his subsequent plea of Not Guilty for the charge of Meehans murder confirms this It was also rumored that there was internal strife in the White Hand Gang Just before his murder Meehan was acquitted in a robbery case while one of his henchman Edward Gilchrist was convicted Dinny was said to have doublecrossed Gilchrist causing resentment within his gang Sadie Meehan told police in November 1923 that her husbands killer was in fact Wild Bill Lovett head of the archrival Jay Street Gang Meehans murder has remained officially unsolved

Rewalsar Lake
Rewalsar Lake is a midaltitude lake located on a mountain spur in the Mandi district 225km southwest from Mandi in India Its elevation is about 1360 m above sea level

The lake is shaped like a square with the shoreline of about 735 m It is held as a sacred spot for Hindus Sikhs and Buddhists
There are three Buddhist monasteries at Riwalsar The lake also has three Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Krishna Lord Shiva and to the sage Lomas Another holy lake Kunt Bhyog which is about 1750 m above sea level lies above Rewalsar It is associated with the escape of Pandavas from the burning palace of waxan episode from the epic Mahabharata

It was from here that the Indian teacher and Tantric Padmasambhava left for Tibet Known to the Tibetans as Guru Rinpoche the Precious Master it was under Padmasambhavas influence that Mahayana Buddhism spread over Tibet There are islands of floating reed on Rewalsar lake and the spirit of Padmasambhava is said to reside in them It is here that the sage Lomas did penance in devotion to Lord Shiva and the Sikh guru Gobind Singh 22 December 1666  7 October 1708 the tenth Guru of Sikhism also resided here for one month

The Sisu fair held in late Februaryearly march and the festival of Baisakhi are important events at Rewalsar

Mandarava and Padmasambhava were energetically drawn to one another Vihardhara fearful of the contamination of the royal bloodline and what he perceived as Mandaravas apostasy endeavoured to have Mandarava and Padmasambhava purified by immolation through the flames of a pyre Instead of finding their corpses incensed and charred Vihardhara finds that the fire of the pyre has been transformed into Lake Rewalsar out of which arises a blooming lotus that supports the unharmed Mandarava and Padmasambhava who through this manifestation of their realisation have achieved their secret names of Vajravarahi and Hayagriva respectively after which Vihardhara furnishes the union with his unreserved blessings

Legend has it that the great teacher Padmasambhava Guru Rinpoche used his enormous power to take flight to Tibet from Rewalsar In Rewalsar his spirit is said to reside in the tiny island of floating reed that drifts over the water

On April 1 2012 a monumental statue of Padmasambhava measuring 375 m 123 ft was consecrated blessed and inaugurated by the 14th Dalai Lama The building project was spearheaded and overseen by Wangdor Rinpoche and funded by donations It took nearly 10 years to complete with the foundation alone taking three years 

The statue was constructed almost entirely by hand by tradespeople from the immediate Rewalsar area and by master artists from Nepal and Bhutan It is made primarily of cement layered by hand over a skeleton of iron rebar while the walls are made of handcut stone Bhutanese sculptors carved intricate details into the cement while still wet It was then painted by masters from Nepal who finished the delicate details by hand The buildings interior is filled with traditional dzong tsa tsas prayer flags and medicine pills made by local craftworkers

Chlamydogobius
Chlamydogobius is a genus of gobies from Australia All but one coastal species C ranunculus are found in inland waters such as springs pools creeks and streams

Most species live in extreme environments for example several species of Chlamydogobius are found in the water that emerges from geothermal springs such as the Dalhousie goby found in the waters around Dalhousie Springs

These fish can live in water with a wide range of temperatures pH salinity and oxygen levels for example they are found in water with a pH between 68 and 90 and temperatures between  They can tolerate salinity as high as 60 parts per thousand almost twice that of sea water They have been found in water with extremely low oxygen levels as low as 08 ppm Their water habitats often exhibit oxygen levels below 5 milligrams of oxygen per litre

To cope with extremely low oxygen levels they will emerge from the water to gulp air known as aerial respiration They also will position themselves over beds of algae to capture the produced oxygen

They will hide in the mud and silt at the bottom of a stream or in a plant or under a rock to avoid more extreme water temperatures Sometimes they will emerge from very hot water for brief periods to take advantage of evaporative cooling
They can survive even if there are drought conditions that reduce the size of their habitat If there is a flood that results in drastically increased water flow they anchor themselves to rocks with their pelvic fins

Chlamydogobius fish are able to change their colours to blend in with their environments

Human drilling activities in Australia have often reduced the pressure of the aquifers that feed the Australian hot springs that Chlamydogobius rely on so some species are endangered

There are currently six recognized species in this genus

Trisbuffered saline
Trisbuffered saline abbreviated TBS is a buffer used in some biochemical techniques to maintain the pH within a relatively narrow range Tris with HCl has a slightly alkaline buffering capacity in the 792 range The conjugate acid of Tris has a pK of 807 at 25C The pK declines approximately 003 units per degree Celsius rise in temperature This can lead to relatively dramatic pH shifts when there are shifts in solution temperature Sodium chloride concentration may vary from 100200 mM tris concentration from 5100 mM and pH from 7280 A common formulation of TBS is 150 mM NaCl 50 mM TrisHCl pH 76 TBS can also be prepared by using commercially made TBS buffer tablets or pouches

TBS has many uses because it is isotonic and nontoxic It can be used to dilute substances used in laboratory experiments Additives can be used to add to a compounds functionality

TBS is often used in immunoblotting for both membrane washing and antibody dilution

American game show winnings records
In the United States a game show is a type of radio television or internet program in which contestants television personalities or celebrities sometimes as part of a team play a game which involves answering trivia questions andor solving puzzles usually for money andor prizes Game shows are usually distinguishable from reality television competition shows in which the competition consumes an entire season of episodes in a game show prizes can typically be won in a single match in some cases particularly in the ones that offer recordsetting prizes contestants can play multiple matches and accumulate a larger total

Since the genre began many shows have offered prizes of large sums of money to contestants Teddy Nadler set the original monetary winnings record of 264000 during his appearance on The 64000 Challenge in 1957 Nadler was not surpassed until 1980 when Thom McKee won 312700 on TicTacDough In 1999 John Carpenter won 1000000 on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire becoming the first person to win a sevenfigure prize on an American game show Since then many players have gone on to win that amount and even surpassed it As of 2019 Brad Rutter is the highestearning American game show contestant of all time having accumulated a total of 4888440 He succeeded Ken Jennings as the highestearning contestant by virtue of his victory on May 16 2014 in the Jeopardy Battle of the Decades tournament

Most daytime game show top prizes were limited to 25000 during the 1960s and 1970s a restriction made for both budgetary concerns and to assuage criticism that arose from the 1950s quiz show scandals The single day record for shows in daytime television was set by Michael Larson in 1984 who won 110237  on Press Your Luck Larson achieved his record by memorizing the shows board patterns He repeatedly hit the boards squares that awarded contestants money and an additional spin That spin would in turn replace the spin he had just used effectively allowing him to spin the board in the second round as long as wanted Because of this his game had to be split into two episodes which aired June 8 and June 11 1984 as his turn caused the game to go well over the shows halfhour allotted time At the time of the shows airing CBS only allowed contestants to win up to 50000 on a game show contestants would retire after winning 25000 the winnings limit increased to 75000 in November of that year and would increase to 100000 and later 125000 before being eliminated in 2006 In 2003 Game Show Network produced a documentary about the event

In 2006 Larson was succeeded by Vickyann ChrobakSadowski who set the record by winning 147517  on the 35th season premiere of The Price Is Right in 2006 ChrobakSadowskis record was later broken by Sheree Heil from her appearance on The Price Is Right in 2013 She won 170345 in cash and prizes on the episode that aired December 30 2013 including an Audi R8 won in the pricing game Gas Money 10000 cash and Prada shoes 

On the October 28 2016 episode of The Price Is Right which aired during Big Money Week Christen Freeman won 210000 in cash during a playing of Cliff Hangers During the episode game rules were modified to offer a top prize of 250000 which was reduced by 10000 for every step the mountain climber took In addition to her One Bid prize and an additional 1000 won during the Showcase Showdown Freemans grand total was 212879  setting a new daytime record

While the 1950s had multiple big winners Herb Stempel and Charles Van Doren of Twenty One being two of the most notable Teddy Nadler set a record during the 195657 television season that would stand for the next two decades winning 264000  on The 64000 Challenge The quiz show scandals of 1958 and 1959 prompted the cancellation of most of the bigbudget game shows and the imposition of strict limits on prize amounts which meant that through the 1960s and 1970s game show contestants could not match their 1950s counterparts

It was not until 1980 that Nadlers record fell During the summer of that year a US Naval officer named Thom McKee began a run on TicTacDough that carried over into the following season Since champions on Tic Tac Dough played until they were defeated and games on the show could end in ties with the pot carrying over McKee was able to keep building his total as long as he kept playing and winning McKee won 312700  in cash and prizes in 43 games which included eight cars on Tic Tac Dough and its sister show The Jokers Wild a contestant automatically won a car after every fifth game they won

While McKee was the biggest solo winner until 1999 nine couples on The 1000000 Chance of a Lifetime won the shows top prize of 1000000  in a combination of prizes and a longterm annuity during the shows run in syndication from January 1986 to September 1987 However this program had no solo players

In 1999 McKee was passed by Michael Shutterly who was the biggest winner in the first season of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in the United States Shutterly was the first contestant on the show to get to the 15th and final question but elected to walk instead with 500000  which made him the biggest winner in American game show history at the time Shutterly had previously won 49200 as a 4 day champion on Jeopardy in 1988 making his career winnings total 549200 

During the second season of Millionaire in the United States the show crowned its first milliondollar winner On November 19 1999 John Carpenter won the shows top prize without using any lifelines save for a phone call on the final question to tell his father he was going to win the million dollars After Carpenter answered the final question which concerned Richard Nixons appearance on LaughIn in 1968 host Regis Philbin proclaimed Carpenter the shows and worldwide formats first top prize winner

Carpenters record remained intact until the following year In early 2000 Rahim Oberholtzer a contestant on the revival of Twenty One won four games in his appearances on the show along with 120000 in the shows Perfect 21 bonus round for a total of 1120000 For surpassing Carpenters mark host Maury Povich proclaimed Oberholtzer the TV Game Show King

Late in its run the Fox show Greed brought back some of its previous winners to try for an extra 1000000 Curtis Warren who was part of the first team to win 1000000 on the show of which his share was 400000 plus 10000 for winning a terminator round was one of the contestants brought back to do so on February 11 2000 Warren was given a question about TV shows that had been made into movies with eight choices of which he had to identify the four correct answers He successfully did so giving himself 1410000  and the record for the time being

Warrens record was even shorter lived than Oberholtzers had been lasting only four days Three days before Warrens win David Legler who also appeared on NBCs Twenty One began a run as champion on the show Four days after Warrens win the run continued with Legler having earned a grand total of 1765000  in six wins to surpass Warrens record and become the third contestant in two months to top 1000000 on a game show

Legler held the record for well over a year outlasting Twenty One itself by July 2000 the milliondollar game show boom went bust and both Greed and Twenty One along with several others were canceled leaving only Millionaire By the start of 2001 the producers of Millionaire decided that it had been too long 71 episodes over a fivemonth period since their top prize had been won and instituted an accumulating jackpot which added 10000 to the grand prize amount for each episode it was not won Kevin Olmstead claimed the top prize on April 10 2001 winning a jackpot of 2180000  Olmstead became the first contestant to top 2000000 in total winnings on a game show and supplanted Legler as the alltime leader

In 2004 ABC launched an ultra highstakes version of Millionaire entitled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire with a 10000000 top prize Two separate Super Millionaire series aired one in February and one in May of that year However despite the higher stakes and the potential for someone to top the alltime record for winnings the largest prize awarded was 1000000  won by Robert Essig

One week after Super Millionaire came to an end Ken Jennings of Salt Lake City Utah became the new champion on Jeopardy The episode broadcast on June 2 2004 was the first in a long winning streak for the software engineer made possible due to a change at the beginning of that season the shows twentieth on air in syndication eliminating the longstanding rule limiting consecutive appearances for a champion to five With no limit to his appearances Jennings began to break many game show records As his streak continued deeper into the 21st season Jennings was inching closer and closer to Olmsteads record Jennings topped Olmsteads Millionaire winnings with his 65th consecutive win finishing the day with 45099 and a new cumulative total of 2197000

Jennings won nine more games before his streak came to an end on November 30 2004 He had extended his record total to 2520700 at the time of his defeat after which he was awarded an additional 2000 for finishing in second place per Jeopardy rules Shortly after Jennings defeat Jeopardy decided to see how he would fare in tournament play On February 9 2005 the show launched its Ultimate Tournament of Champions inviting back 144 other past champions to compete over the next three months in a fiveround singleelimination tournament with a 2000000 grand prize The field included the highestwinning fivetime champions and winners of some previous tournaments though not all invitees were able to participate Jennings received a bye into the finals of the tournament where he faced semifinal winners Jerome Vered and Brad Rutter in a threegame cumulative total match Vered had set a singleday scoring record during his appearance on the show in 1992 while Rutter had won the 2001 Tournament of Champions and the 2002 Million Dollar Masters tournament and was the shows highestearning contestant of alltime before Jennings

In the tournaments threeday final Rutter defeated Jennings and Vered to win the tournament and 2000000 and in the process he supplanted Jennings as the winningest all time American game show contestant Including the 118 million he had won in his previous Jeopardy appearances five regular season games a Tournament of Champions win the Million Dollar Masters win and three matches in the earlier rounds of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions Rutters total stood at 3255102 while Jennings was now second with 3022700 having gained an additional 500000 for his secondplace finish in the tournament

Jennings slowly began to chip away at Rutters record first by winning 71429 in 2006 as part of the Mob on NBCs 1 vs 100 A year later Jennings won the Grand Slam tournament on Game Show Network and the 100000 top prize by defeating Ogi Ogas in the final round Finally on October 10 2008 Jennings passed Rutter by winning 500000 on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader He extended the record by winning 300000 in The IBM Challenge where he and Rutter took on IBM supercomputer Watson in a special 2011 Jeopardy event Rutter won 200000 in the challenge in which both he and Jennings pledged half of their winnings to charity He then added 100000 more later in 2011 when he appeared on Million Dollar Mind Game raising his total to 3555102 second only to Jennings 392341429

In 2014 Jennings and Rutter were both invited to play in the Jeopardy Battle of the Decades a tournament conducted by the producers of Jeopardy to celebrate its thirtieth season in syndication Both men advanced to the twoday tournament final with Roger Craig filling the third position Needing a win to reclaim his record Rutter took the top prize in the tournament after Jennings who needed to answer the second days Final Jeopardy clue correctly to win after making a sufficient wager failed to do so Rutter won the top prize of 1000000 while Jennings won the 100000 second prize

Jennings later appeared on Millionaire in November 2014 Winning the top prize was the only way he could have reclaimed the record from Rutter however Jennings finished with only 100000 leaving him in second place He was then a contestant on the ABC primetime show 500 Questions in 2016 however as he only lasted four questions he was unable to add to his total

Both Jennings and Rutter competed in the Jeopardy AllStar Games in 2019 Under the format of that tournament teams of three competed in a relay to win a 1000000 top prize split between them thus either Jennings or Rutter would be able to add up to 33333334 to their totals as captains of their respective teams if they won the total was not enough for Jennings to surpass Rutter Rutters team won the tournament with Jenningss team finishing in second and winning 300000 to split between them
A month after the AllStar Games came to an end James Holzhauer became the new champion on Jeopardy The episode which was broadcast on April 4 2019 was the first episode in what is an ongoing winning streak where he became the third contestant to win 1000000 or more in the shows history As of May 1 Holzhauer who also has 5833333 in winnings from his win on The Chase ranks eighth in earnings among all game shows Jeopardy has taped three months of additional episodes that have not yet been broadcast it finished taping for the season which runs through July in April and thus Holzhauer may have already won substantially more money than has publicly been reported

Rectus sheath
The rectus sheath also called the rectus fascia is formed by the aponeuroses of the transverse abdominal and the external and internal oblique muscles It contains the rectus abdominis and pyramidalis muscles

It can be divided into anterior and posterior laminae

The arrangement of the layers has important variations at different locations in the body

For context above the sheath are the following two layers


Within the sheath the layers vary

Below the sheath are the following three layers

The rectus in the situation where its sheath is deficient below is separated from the peritoneum only by the transversalis fascia in contrast to the upper layers where part of the internal oblique also runs beneath the rectus Because of the thinner layers below this region is more susceptible to herniation

Since the tendons of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis only reach as high as the costal margin it follows that above this level the sheath of the rectus is deficient behind the muscle resting directly on the cartilages of the ribs and being covered only by the tendons of the external obliques

Boduberu
Boduberu Dhivehi  is similar to some of the songs and dances found in east and south west Africa It is likely that the music was introduced to The Maldives by sailors from the Indian Ocean region It may be said that Boduberu first made an appearance in The Maldives in the 11th Century AD or possibly before that 
Boduberu is performed by about 20 people including three drummers and a lead singer They are accompanied by a small bell a set of drums also known as a bodu beru and an onugandu  a small piece of bamboo with horizontal grooves from which raspy sounds are produced by scraping The songs may be of heroism romance or satire The prelude to the song is a slow beat with emphasis on drumming and dancing As the song reaches a crescendo one or two dancers maintain the wild beat with their frantic movements ending in some cases in a trance

The costume of the performers is a sarong and a white short sleeved shirt

Boduberu evolved among the common citizens as an alternative to court music In the early days the people gathered together to perform Boduberu and it became widely accepted as the music of the common people The performing of the music is often referred as vibrating the island A notable point about Boduberu is its noise and sometimes meaningless lyrics sung The lyrics do not have a meaning because it consists of a mixture of local neighbouring and some African words Today meaningful songs written in the local language Dhivehi are sung to the rhythm of Boduberu

Boduberu is usually sung after a hard days work The location is up to the performers Today Boduberu is an important item of entertainment at stage shows celebrations and festivals

The bodu beru is a Maldivian drum made of wood from coconut tree trunk and often grouped in trios The instrument is used to accompany a dance of the same name the Boduberu

Strathgryffe
Strathgryffe or Gryffe Valley both also spelled Gryfe Gaelic Srath Ghriobhaidh is a strath centred on the River Gryffe in the west central Lowlands of Scotland The River Gryffe passes through the council areas of Inverclyde and Renfrewshire rising in Kilmacolm and joining the Black Cart Water between Houston and Inchinnan

The river and its strath extend over the historic county of Renfrewshire Strathgryfe anciently a feudal lordship is associated historically with the origins of the county and anciently the name was used not only for the Strath of Gryffe itself but for a traditional Province covering the whole of what later became Renfrewshire

The lands of Strathgryffe were granted by King David I to Walter fitz Alan first High Steward of Scotland and founder of the Stewart family in Scotland in the 1130s The Stewarts would be based in Strathgryffe for centuries thereafter

The introduction of Sheriffs created a further source of political authority in Strathgryffe In the mid 19th century local government reforms replaced the ancient provinces by new Counties shires aligned to sheriffdom boundaries As the sheriff for Strathgryffe had based himself in Renfrew the county was called county of Renfrew

A Strath is a wide glen The term is rendered in Scots Gaelic as Srath and in the ancient Modern Welsh as Ystrad

Stragrif is mentioned in the 1169 charter of Paisley Abbey which placed the churches of the area under the control of the new abbey Later the name Gryff is recorded in the Military Survey of Scotland 17471755 compiled by William Roy a predecessor to the Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain However it seems that Gryfe was the established usage until more recent times

The Gryffe name is becoming the predominant usage in the area seen for example in new signposts showing the name of the river and the names of organisations such as the Gryffe Valley Rotary Club and Gryffe High School in Houston Renfrewshire

There are a number of villages in Strathgryffe varying considerably in size The following straddle or are immediately adjacent to the River Gryffe

The geography of the area is a contrasting mix of green fields surrounding the river with rough moorland in the higher areas particularly Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park

Charles Vernon Culver
Charles Vernon Culver September 6 1830  January 10 1909 was a Republican member of the US House of Representatives from Pennsylvania

Culver was born in Logan Ohio He received a liberal preparatory schooling and attended the Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware Ohio He moved to Pennsylvania and settled in Reno Pennsylvania and engaged in mercantile pursuits He also became interested in the development of oil in Venango County Pennsylvania and the establishment of national banks in thirteen cities throughout the East

He was elected as a Republican to the Thirtyninth Congress He was not a candidate for renomination in 1866 While a member of Congress he became bankrupt and was imprisoned in 1866 but was eventually acquitted after a long trial He resumed operations in the oil business with headquarters in Franklin Pennsylvania He died while on a business trip in Philadelphia in 1909 He was interred in Franklin Cemetery in Franklin Pennsylvania

Culver had made a small profit in Logan Ohio by investing some bank money in oil He took that money and began buying up banks throughout the oil region He bought land two miles below Oil City Pennsylvania where he established the town of Reno and The Reno Oil and Land Company and starting selling stock in what appears to have been a basic pyramid scheme

Culver also attempted to establish the RenoPithole railroad to run between Reno and Pithole Pennsylvania the leading oil boom town at the time Culver was not one for half measuresto run the railroad he hired Ambrose Burnside and to hook investors he brought deeppocketed men of wealth from all over the country to tour his asyetnonexistent oil fields

Ultimately Culvers plan collapsed and he was pursued by creditors and courts up and down the oil region The collapse of his banks triggered a financial panic throughout the oil region that drove many oilmen out of the business and created chaos that set the stage for men like John D Rockefeller to move in

A more complete and colorful account of Culvers career can be found in the book The Great Oildorado by Hildegarde Dolson

Split nut
A split nut is a nut that is split lengthwise into two pieces opposed halves so that its female thread may be opened and closed over the male thread of a bolt or leadscrew This allows the nut when open to move along the screw without the screw turning or vice versa to allow the screw to pass through the nut without turning Then when the nut is closed it resumes the normal movement of a nut on a screw in which axial travel is linked to rotational travel

A split nut assembly is often used in positioning systems for example in the leadscrew of a lathe It is one of the machine elements that makes singlepoint threading practical on manual nonCNC lathes The very earliest screwcutting lathes in the late 18th and early 19th centuries did not have them but within a few decades split nuts were common on lathes

The two halves of the nut have chamfered ends 60 to axis which helps the threads to find engagement during the closing action Usually the screw and nut are also oiled for lubrication Such provisions prolong the service life of the threads by minimizing wear

Split nuts work best with trapezoidal threads

Split nuts may not engage and disengage with multi start threads screw thread due to the overlapping leads

Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme
The Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme Somme Bay Railway is a preserved railway in northern France The railway is managed by a nonprofit organization which runs from March to December between the towns of the Baie de Somme area Le Crotoy and CayeuxsurMer via NoyellessurMer and SaintValerysurSomme on metre gauge tracks formerly part of Socit gnrale des chemins de fer conomiques The association was founded in 1970 and over the years it has become a major player in tourism development in the Picardy coast and is also responsible for the preservation safeguarding and enhancement of the fleet full of cars wagons steam locomotives and diesel locomotives The line is one of the closest French heritage lines to the UK Noyelles is from BoulognesurMer and from Calais A part of the line has dual gauge track and although forming part of a group of five lines at least a part of it has always been open to traffic

A branch to SaintValery had been proposed as early as 1845 In 1853 the Chemin de Fer du Nord was granted permission to build a single track branch from Noyelles to SaintValery This long line crossed the River Dien by means of a long wooden trestle bridge The original passenger station at SaintValery stood at the site later occupied by SaintValery Canal station The line opened to traffic on 5 June 1858 It was 1885 before the CF du Nord was able to get permission to use steam locomotives at SaintValerys docks horse power having to be used before them

In the 1880s there were various schemes to build narrow gauge lines of either or metre gauge in the Somme dpartement Eventually a metre gauge line nearly long was built by the Socit gnrale des chemins de fer conomiques SE from Noyelles to Le Crotoy opening on 1 July 1887 A second metre gauge line opened on 6 September 1887 from Noyelles to Cayeux from Noyelles with stations at SaintValery Ville and LanchresPend The line between Noyelles and SaintValery being laid between the rails of the standard gauge branch which was also extended into SaintValery Ville The line between Noyelles and SaintValery kept its Intrt Gnral status and the other lines had Intrt Local status with separate tickets being issued for each part of the route

The railway carried holidaymakers to seaside resorts and transporting local freight of galets sugar beet chicory and shellfish Running around the entire length of the Somme Bay in the Somme dpartement in Picardy northern France it connected Le Crotoy with NoyellessurMer SaintValerysurSomme and CayeuxsurMer including the sands at BrightonPlage Other minor stations or halts were provided near assorted villages hamlets and farms In its literature the operating Association claims that past passengers have included Colette Jules Verne Anatole France and ToulouseLautrec

These lines with two others were grouped together as the Rseau des Bains de Mer The other two lines were one from Noyelles to ForestlAbbaye and one from Abbeville to DompierresurAuthie which had a junction with the line from Noyelles at ForestlAbbaye The Rseau des Bains de Mer was a part of the 

The CFBS line was affected by three wars The FrancoPrussian War the First World War and the Second World War

France declared war on Prussia on 19 July 1870 SaintValery was a strategic port and thus its capture was an objective of the Prussians In October 1870 the French requisitioned Jules Vernes boat SaintMichel I for the defence of the Baie de Somme The boat was crewed by Crimean War veterans In December 1870 horses and equipment were requisitioned for use by the French cavalry A consignment of six hundred saddles left SaintValery by train for Noyelles on the 30 December The Prussians occupied SaintValery from February 1871 until September 1873

The CFBS line was particularly involved towards the end of the First World War starting with Operation Michael on 21 March 1918 It was realised that the German advance threatened the Allies ability to use railways in the area and that there was a lack of line capacity in certain places Therefore a double track standard gauge line was constructed linking the main line from Calais with the AbancourtSt Omer line The engineer Raoul Dautry claimed he could build the line in 100 days Work began on 15 May 1918 and the line opened to traffic on 15 August 1918 just 106 days later Thus the line was known as La Ligne de Cent Jours or The Line of One Hundred Days The line was last used on 1 January 1919 and the track lifted in March and April of that year thus ending the short life of the line

On 21 May 1940 German troops invaded the Baie de Somme area Noyelles was the scene of Allied air strikes on various occasions In September and October 1942 coastal defences were constructed in the Baie de Somme area In February 1944 the Germans flooded the lowlying land near Noyelles by blocking the River Dien where the railway to SaintValery crossed it by a long embankment this embankment had replaced a trestle in 1912 In April and May 1944 preparations were made to prevent the Allies from using the area to invade France

On 24 October 1941 a train was attacked at Noyelles and the locomotive was destroyed In November 1941 one of the metregauge trains was attacked between Noyelles and SaintValery with several railway workers wounded Cayeux saw much increased traffic in galets temporary gauge lines being laid on the beach and down the streets of the village A metregauge line was laid along the road from Lanchres to Ault on the standard gauge line from Woincourt to  with a branch or separate gauge line at Hautebut to a quarry near the coast The Germans brought in a number of locomotives to work these lines and after the war nine of them were dumped just outside SaintValery where three still remain a fourth having been removed for restoration in 1997  see below

On 2 December 1942 the water tower at SaintValery was destroyed On 4 May 1944 the depot at SaintValery along with two rail cars and a locomotive were destroyed by fire In June the SaintValery area was bombed as a diversion from the DDay landings On 19 August the Resistance blew up the water tower at Noyelles followed by an ammunition train on 1 September English and Polish troops relieved SaintValery on 2 September and proceeded to bombard the Germans across the bay at Le Crotoy

The main types of freight carried by the railway were

A chicory processing works was built at SaintValery Canal A siding was laid in 1929 to serve it The derelict building was demolished in 1998

The main sugar beet season was from October to January thus providing useful income out of the tourist season A raperie shredding plant was built at Lanchres It had its own railway system and locomotives which also worked on the CFBS line to Noyelles

Before the railway came the port of SaintValery handled galets flint or silica pebbles brought on rafts from Cayeux The galets were used in the building and ceramics industries

Local shellfish taken from the Baie de Somme were sent to market at Abbeville Shellfish not available locally were also brought in to Le Crotoy for use in a restaurant there

SaintValery handled timber jute textiles soap phosphates and coal Phosphates were mined at CrcyenPonthieu and transported via a metre gauge line from there to Noyelles and thence to SaintValery Freight between Noyelles and SaintValery was sometimes carried in standard gauge wagons but hauled by the metre gauge locomotives This practice continued until 1973

After the Second World War a plan was put forward to extend the standard gauge to Le Crotoy and Cayeux with a new line to at a cost of some FRF150200 million In 1963 another proposal was made to extend the dual gauge track to Lanchres at a cost of some FRF93 million Even as late as 1968 plans were being proposed to extend the standard gauge to Cayeux this time with the closure of the branch to Le Crotoy

The line from SaintValery Ville to Cayeux was relaid with rails recovered from the standard gauge WoincourtOrival line which closed to passengers in May 1939 and completely from 1 January 1947 In 1949 the CFBS acquired some second hand steam locomotives after the closure of the Rseau Albert Three secondhand railcars were acquired in 1955 and a new railcar was acquired in 1957 along with two second hand diesel locomotives A third diesel locomotive was acquired in 1960 In 1971 a pair of De DionBouton type OC1 bogie railcars X157 and X158 were acquired from the Rseau Breton RB having been previously used on the Chemin de Fer des CtesduNord CdN X158 was subsequently transferred to the Chemins de Fer de la Corse and is now preserved by the CdN Society at Langueux A trailing railcar was also acquired from the RB in 1971 having previously been built as a powered railcar

The CFBS steam locomotives were mainly confined to the sugar beet trains after the war The very last CFBS steam train running on 5 April 1959 The steam locomotive from the raperie at Lanchres worked until 1965 The raperie itself closed in 1966 at the end of the 6566 season

Even as late as 1958 the CFBS lines were carrying some 5055000 tonnes of freight including 3540000 tonnes of sugar beet and 10000 tonnes of galets In that year a railcar caught fire at Cayeux and the fire destroyed the loco shed which was rebuilt In 1961 the SE merged with the Compagnie Gnrale de Chemins de Fer et de Transports Automobiles CFTA The CFTA had interests in road transport and instigated a system of rationalisation and cuts The company livery changed from green to red and cream Both goods and passenger traffic declined during the middle 60s and the line from Noyelles to Le Crotoy closed with effect from 31 December 1969 CFTA worked the line to Cayeux for three more years galets being carried by rail as late as 1970 The line from SaintValery to Cayeux closed with effect from 31 December 1972 The SNCF continued to use the standard gauge line between Noyelles and SaintValery for occasional freight trains The SNCF line between Noyelles and SaintValery was last used on 6 February 1989 and closed with effect from 1 January 1993

Local opposition to the closure of the line to Le Crotoy was strong and a preservation group was formed on 13 November 1969 initially under the name of Association Ferroviaire Picardie and from 14 March 1970 the Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme CFBS The initial aim of the society was to preserve the line from Noyelles to Le Crotoy as a tourist line The first tourist trains ran on 4 July 1971 but although the railway had permission from SNCF to run into Noyelles they were not allowed to drop or collect passengers there under an agreement with the local bus company This arrangement lasting until 1986

With the announcement that the Cayeux line was to close the CFBS set up a new company the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer Touristiques et Industriels de Picardie CFTIP which was founded 17 April 1973 From 1973 to 1981 it was the CFTIP rather than the CFBS which was responsible for running the trains The CFTIP was unsuccessful in its bid to take over the freight traffic from Noyelles to SaintValery from SNCF In 1976 there was a split within the CFBSCFTIP a splinter group the Chemin de Fer Touristique de la Cte dOpale CFTO running trains between SaintValery Ville and Cayeux The CFTO folded in December 1977 and the Cayeux line reverted to the CFTIP By the late 1970s the growth in the numbers of passengers meant that more coaches were needed but those inherited from the SECFTA were in poor condition Nine coaches were acquired from Switzerland between 1978 and 1984

The CFBS again suffered a drop in passengers in the early 80s but in 1982 the CFTIP was wound up and the CFBS confirmed as its successor in an agreement with SNCF and the Somme Dpartement
At the end of the operation of the public service by the CFTA an association of volunteers passionate about railways the nonprofit Association of Railway Bay of Somme SFBC established on March 13 1970 decides to operate as a tourist railway line Sea Baths group linking NoyellessurMer in Crotoy closed since December 31 1969  The operation of the line is then only during the summer Winter is conducive to maintenance of the line and equipment

Thanks to the financial support of different institutions the municipalities served Grand Picardy coast formerly SMACOPI General Council Regional Council State  DRAC European Union etc enabled the CFBS to perform maintenance of the tracks stations and equipment All this caused a continuous increase in the number of visitors in the mid 1990s which increased from 20 000 to 100 000 per year In 2011 the association exceeded the symbolic threshold of 150000 passengers and there were more than 162 000 passengers carried in 2013

Although the whole line is preserved the section from SaintValery to Cayeux is operated only on certain days between April and September including all save 4 days in July and August Five of the minor stations or halts are still in use in addition to the stations in the above named towns

The SFBC is an association made up of over 400 members including at least 80 active volunteers and employs the equivalent of 22 fulltime employees The CFBS selffinances its operating costs salaries maintenance coal etc and participates in investments facilities infrastructure equipment etc

The CFBS operates its network with metergauge track but dualgauge track remains between the station Noyelles and SaintValery Port Transhipment facilities for cargo still exist in Noyelles that are used in every Steam Festival
The various lines are single track with passing loops in the station allowing trains to cross
Except Noyelles station equipped with a mechanical signaling system of the old SNCF type there is little signalling on the line and traffic safety is ensured by instructions A Line Manager ensures the operational use of the network and can communicate by groundtotrain radio with all trains Automatic level crossings are installed at intersections with major roads and unguarded crossings to other crossings
The workshop equipment is installed in SaintValery Canal Station Turntables exist at Noyelles SaintValery Ville and Port Le Crotoy and at Cayeux However the locomotives can travel in both directions of traffic without being rotated E332 is the only CFBS locomotive which cannot be turned on any of the turntable except SaintValery Port

There is still a track connection with the SNCF which is commonly used during the Steam Festival

The line from Noyelles sur Mer to Le Crotoy is metre gauge

The line from Noyelles sur Mer to SaintValery Ville is of dual gauge with metre gauge tracks laid within standard gauge track thus having four rails At SaintValery there is a branch to the SaintValery docks which is dual gauge but having three rails only The line from SaintValery Ville to Cayeux Brighton Plage is metre gauge

The Festival of steam was organized for the first time in 1988 on the occasion of the centenary of the Network de Bains de Mer The CFBS organized a steam engine rally in NoyellessurMer the point of correspondence between the Network Bains de Mer and that of the SNCF  It quickly became a major event and the CFBS reorganizes it every three years with many steam engines from all over the Europe It has become a major event for lovers of railways but also for the people of the Somme bay and tourists The railway is of course put forward but also the tractors buses rolls saws  and many other machines from the past are exhibited
The last event took place on 27 and 28 April 2013  The association has set up a website dedicated to the event which recounts the various steam events until 2009  For the 2013 event many materials have come from other networks including seven steam locomotives including 150 p13 of the Train City and 020 Peckett n o 12 Marcia of the Kent  East Sussex Railway  several carriages and a SpragueThomson of Paris metro owned by ADEMAS  This event welcomed nearly 21000 visitors including 7250 travelers

From Le Crotoy to Cayeux the stations are

This station is on the metre gauge branch from Noyelles opened on 1 July 1887 There is a shed where the steam engines can be stored and light maintenance can be carried out

A small halt serving the village of Favires

A small halt serving the village

A station was opened at Noyelles in 1847 being on the standard gauge line between Boulogne and Amiens In 1858 a single track branch opened to SaintValery sur Somme Metre gauge branches opened to Le Crotoy and Cayeux in 1887 the latter being laid between the rails of the standard gauge branch to SaintValery The final line to be built to Noyelles was a metre gauge branch to Forest lAbbaye which opened on 24 August 1892 and closed to passengers on 10 March 1947 and freight on 1 February 1951

This was the site of the original terminus of the standard gauge branch from Noyelles opened on 5 June 1858 It is now the site of their depot although some of the original buildings still survive

This was the main station for SaintValery when the dual gauge line was opened in 1887 the station at SaintValery Ville then being a halt

This station opened on 6 September 1887 The station has always been dual gauge

A small halt serving the villages of Pend and Routhiauville

This station is on the metre gauge branch from Noyelles to Cayeux it opened on 6 September 1887 and serves the villages of Lanchres and Pend

This halt was opened in 1890 after local people called for a station to be built

This station is the terminus of the metre gauge branch from Noyelles It opened on 6 September 1887 In 1912 a extension was built to serve a or gauge railway worked by horses to bring galets flints for onward shipment Another short extension was also built at Cayeux after WWII to serve the Sansom factory this was in use until the 1960s

The Association du Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme has restored a number of locomotives railbuses carriages and wagons to full use others await overhaul or restoration All vehicles are metre gauge unless otherwise denoted

None of the original steam locomotives that worked on the Rseau des Bains de Mer have survived into preservation The locomotive that most represents those that did work the line is the HaineStPierre loco which carries works number 13161921 A group of eleven similar locos works numbers 130414 inclusive were built in 1921 for the SE and four of those are known to have worked on the Rseau des Bains de Mer system including the CFBS lines











The CFBS is twinned with the Kent and East Sussex Railway a preserved standard gauge railway in England The twinning agreement was signed on 27 April 1996 at Noyelles The KESRs P Class locomotive was present The railway is also twinned with the Association des chemins de fer des CtesduNord on the northwest coast

KSYN
KSYN 925 FM known as Kissin 925 is a CHR radio station licensed to Joplin Missouri It serves the FourState Region Cities in KSYNs primary coverage area include Joplin Neosho Monett and Nevada Missouri Pittsburg Parsons Fort Scott and Chanute Kansas Miami and Vinta Oklahoma and Bella Vista Rogers and Bentonville Arkansas

FounderKSYN was founded in 1960 by William B Bill Neal Following an injury that occurred during the Battle of the Bulge Neal was transferred to Paris France where he began his career in broadcasting with the Armed Forces Radio Service In addition to KSYN Neal owned WMBH and founded Joplin AM station KQYX In 2000 Neal was awarded the Pioneer in Broadcasting Award from Missouri Southern State University in recognition of his work in the development of FM radio and for his role in popularizing the modern AM talk radio format He is also one of only six individuals to be honored with the Lifetime Member award from the Missouri Broadcasters Association

The 1960s  1970sOn December 19 1960 KSYN became the first FM radio station to operate in the Four State Region It was the tenth FM station established in Missouri and the states most powerful with a 100000 watt tower that stood more than 90 stories tall In these early days KSYN could be heard clearly as far away as Kansas City Missouri and Tulsa Oklahoma

While the increasing popularity of Rock n Roll helped propel KSYNs rapid ascent to number one in listener ratings Neal still had to overcome a fundamental problem few people in those days owned FM receivers To meet this challenge KSYN provided free radios to area businesses and organizations so that they could hear for themselves the differences in sound quality between AM and FM A small black and silver sign was provided with each radio for display reading The Wonderful Sound of FM  KSYN To reach mobile listeners the station gave away hundreds of FM car radios at live remotes and on the air to callers who answered trivia questions correctly To those unable to obtain free FM radios the station offered receivers for sale at wholesale prices

During this period KSYN was known for largescale innovative promotions In a 2000 interview with Missouri Southern State University Bill Neal remarked that Radio is about promotion Translating this philosophy into action the station regularly underwrote the costs of bringing popular artists to Joplin It also developed an annual KSYN Olympics which was held at Wildcat Park and Shadow Lake Events included bikini contests boat races and numerous other competitions designed to entertain the large and often raucous crowds One particularly memorable promotion involved a helicopter that showered 40000 in cash and prizes over downtown Joplin This promotion effectively closed downtown for a day leading the city to inform the station owner that any future permit applications would not be viewed favorably

In the late 1960s and throughout most of the 1970s broadcasting hall of fame announcer Bob James hosted a popular news talk show on Sunday mornings that featured local and state public officials high school and college coaches and other newsmakers James is perhaps best known for his coverage of the Connor Hotel collapse which occurred November 11 1978 During the days following the incident KSYN provided indepth coverage of the events from its mobile news unit which was parked downtown near what remained of the hotel James reporting focused on the search and rescue efforts for three men who were trapped beneath the rubble When after 77 hours rescue workers found one of the men alive in a corner of the hotels basement James was there to report the news that so many had been waiting to hear With Bob James as News Director KSYN was an important source for both news and entertainment

The 1980sKSYN may have reached its apex in terms of popularity and influence in the early and middle 1980s In 1985 for example KSYN had 175 percent of the total listenership winning the top spot for every segment of the day Radio was still largely free of competition from other music delivery platforms MTV was just catching on and the internet MP3 players and satellite radio had yet to be created 

Rather than sitting back and allowing the popularity of the format to carry the station Bill Neal sought to cement KSYN as an indelible part of local popular culture He accomplished this by further accelerating promotional activities During these years KSYN tee shirts and bumper stickers were ubiquitous throughout the Four State Area The station regularly gave away thousands of dollars in cash not to mention countless tee shirts hats cases of soft drinks and Worlds of Fun tickets And KSYN didnt just broadcast the music it brought the artists who made the music to Joplin sponsoring top shelf acts such as Joan Jett and The Blackhearts Jefferson Starship Air Supply Stevie Ray Vaughan John Waite Survivor Night Ranger and Cheap Trick In addition KSYNs current moniker draws its heritage from this period when in the early 1980s it was known as Kissin 925 Your Number One Hit Music Leader

The 1990sLed by Tulsa Oklahomas Garth Brooks the early 1990s saw a powerful resurgence in country music Seemingly overnight country overtook rock as the most popular radio format Put simply country was in and rock was out This phenomenon knocked KSYN from atop the listener ratings for consecutive years for the first time in its history And while country musics popularity has receded from this highwater mark it remains to this day the most popular format in the Four State Region

Although the early 1990s and country music brought an end to KSYNs 40year reign at the pinnacle of listener ratings this period is not without its high points Chief among these is that the broadcasting station was refurbished Compact disk players replaced tapes and records improving sound quality Computers took the place of several refigeratorsized mechanical processors enhancing programming reliability And remote satellite programs replaced overnight announcers saving costs while adding an element of national entertainment to the lineup In short the station took a giant leap toward the 21st Century

By 1995 rock had begun to recover and so had KSYNs listener ratings Given the overall favorable dynamics it was in this year that William B Neal chose to conclude his career in broadcastinga career that spanned more than a half centuryby selling KSYN to Big Mack Broadcasting Inc Big Mack was owned by Chuck Dunaway who was like his predecessor an influential figure within the radio business having been inducted into both the Texas and Ohio Broadcasting Halls of Fame

Chuck Dunaways career in radio began in 1952 as an announcer for KBST in Big Spring Texas Quickly rising through the ranks in the late 1950s he assumed the afternoon drivetime slot for New Yorks top rated station WABCAM Dunaway eventually parlayed his success as an announcer into station proprietorship purchasing his first radio station in 1982 and eventually owning six in the Joplin market alone Under Dunaways relatively brief period of ownership KSYN continued much as it had under Neal Chuck Dunaways legacy at KSYN could be described as that of a steady and experienced hand who bridged the gap between longterm owners

The Modern Era
If one were looking to quickly categorize KSYNs history it could be logically divided into two parts the William B Neal era which spans from 1960 to 1995 and the James L Zimmer era which began in 1998 and continues into the present

Since 1998 KSYN has been owned by James L Jim Zimmer under the Zimmer familys Zimmer Radio Group 19982006 and Zimmer Radio Inc 2007present During the Zimmer era the station has been brought fully into the modern computer age and KSYNs position near the top of listener surveys has been reestablished

Under Zimmer KSYN became only the second station in the FourState Region to begin broadcasting in HD Radio and was one of the first to embrace the internet platform for content distribution The stations HD2 channel Kissin HD2 offers improved sound quality and a slightly different format than the primary Kissin 925 in the form of more urban oriented music

Godai Tomoatsu
Godai was born in Satsuma domain in what is now part of Kagoshima city Kagoshima Prefecture and was sent by the domain to study naval science and technology at the Kaigun Denshujo in Nagasaki At the outbreak of the AngloSatsuma War of 1864 he was appointed captain of the Tenu Maru Along with Matsuki Koan he was taken prisoner by the Royal Navy when his ship was captured He was chosen as one of 15 students to be sent to Great Britain to study at the University College London in defiance of the Tokugawa bakufus official national seclusion policy

In 1865 Godai made contact with Thomas Glover who steered negotiations with the Platt textile machinery giant in Oldham Lancashire England This visit led to the establishment of the Kagoshima Mill in Satsuma in 1867  reputed to be Japans first modern factory Manchester engineers spent a year in Kagoshima to supervise building factory production and the training of local workers The Manchester Seven  as they became known had a special White Mansion constructed for their comfort and is today a museum Godais UK visit also included the Manchester Chamber of Commerce  reputed to have inspired the foundation of the pioneering Osaka Chamber and Industry

Godai later returned to Europe to negotiate with the Comte des Cantons de Charles Montblanc 18321893 to establish a joint venture commercial enterprise for the development of Satsumas natural resources in exchange for European weapons and manufactured goods This FrenchSatsuma trading company attracted French investment into the Satsuma domain to establish a steamship shipyard and textile silk spinning factories and to send promising students from Satsuma overseas Its existence also allowed Satsuma to participate as if it were an independent country in the Paris Exhibition of 1867 much to the consternation of the Tokugawagovernment representatives At the same time Godai used his contacts to purchase the latest warships to equip the Satsuma in preparation with the growing conflict to overthrow the Tokugawa regime

After the Meiji Restoration Godai became a Sanyo junior councilor and used his foreign experience to defuse a number of incidents created against foreigners by xenophobic exsamurai He resigned from government service in 1869 and turned his full attention to business Basing himself in Osaka he created several major joint stock companies involved in international trade commerce and shipping which he operated simultaneously Godai went on to found the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and the Osaka Stock Exchange He also participated in the Osaka Conference of 1875 which attempted to hold together the fragile coalition of feudal domains which dominated the early Meiji government

Resource allocation computer
In computing resource allocation is necessary for any application to be run on the system When the user opens any program this will be counted as a process and therefore requires the computer to allocate certain resources for it to be able to run Such resources could have access to a section of the computers memory data in a device interface buffer one or more files or the required amount of processing power

A computer with a single processor can only perform one process at a time regardless of the amount of programs loaded by the user or initiated on startup Computers using single processors appear to be running multiple programs at once because the processor quickly alternates between programs processing what is needed in very small amounts of time This process is known as multitasking or time slicing The time allocation is automatic however higher or lower priority may be given to certain processes essentially giving high priority programs morebigger slices of the processors time

On a computer with multiple processors different processes can be allocated to different processors so that the computer can truly multitask Some programs such as Adobe Photoshop and YafRay which can require intense processing power have been coded so that they are able to run on more than one processor at once thus running more quickly and efficiently
This method is generally suitable for multiprogramming environments and is actually very helpful

Prison of StLaurentduMaroni
The prison of SaintLaurentduMaroni was the main penal establishment of French Guiana for a century Some of the buildings were restored in the early 1980s

On 22 November 1850 Napoleon III declared Six thousand condemned men in our prisons weigh heavily on our budget becoming increasingly depraved and constantly menacing our society I think it is possible to make the sentence of forced labour more effective more moralising less expensive and more humane by using it to further the progress of French colonisation

The first batch of prisoners left the Breton port of Brest for the les du Salut on 31 March 1852 The prison at StLaurentduMaroni was established on the banks of the Maroni River on 21 February 1858 All the prisoners sent from France were taken there before being transferred to other prisons or camps The town of SaintLaurentduMaroni proper was founded on 16 March 1880 it was a penal town whose inhabitants were nearly all guards or liberated prisoners The hospital was built in 1912 and the prison itself closed in 1946 the same year the whole colonial penal system was abolished

The prison at SaintLaurent was but a temporary stop for most prisoners Only a small number of men ever stayed in SaintLaurent for long and they were nearly all employed in the penitentiary administration or were considered harmless and unlikely to try to escape

When a ship such as La Loire or La Martinire arrived from SaintMartindeR the first order of the day was to separate the chevaux de retour literally returned horses but meaning the escaped prisoners and the recidivists from the rest to send them to the les du Salut from whose shores escape was considered impossible A few however succeeded most famously Henri Charrire who later wrote Papillon The new prisoners then stayed for a while in SaintLaurent where they were sorted into different camps or prisons The ones considered to be shifty and eager to escape were sent to the islands along with the recidivists and exescapees The least dangerous men condemned to prison for petty offences were offered jobs in the penitentiary administration The prisoners were also separated by nationality as there were special camps reserved for those from Indochina and the Arabs often became guards

Since there was a hospital in SaintLaurent many prisoners faked illnesses to get sent there where they had plenty of time to plot escapes as experienced and written by among others Charrire Since many prisoners worked in the hospital this was not terribly hard to do

Those who were lucky enough to stay in SaintLaurent were generally better treated than prisoners in other camps Their work was simple they were free to go wherever they wanted inside the prison and were given better rations

Sundance charter vessel
Sundance is a charter vessel owned by Capital Pleasure Boats and operating on the River Thames Former names are Gay Enterprise and Solent Enterprise

The vessel was built in 1971 for the Gosport Ferry service by James and Stone of Brightlingsea primarily for cruising Portsmouth Harbour and the Solent Originally called Gay Enterprise the name was changed in the winter of 1979 during her standby ferry duties to Solent Enterprise It had a similar design to the companys two 1966 Queens Portsmouth Queen and Gosport Queen but the interior was more comfortable because of its different duty It was painted in later years in a blue livery with a large Solent Enterprise banner on its side barriers In its later years of service it was regularly used on ferry duties between Gosport and Portsmouth when either of the Queens were out of service In 2001 Gosport Ferry Company purchased a new ferry the Spirit of Gosport but the company also wanted to replace the Solent Enterprise in its cruising role Both Queens therefore stayed on and the Spirit of Gosport only had a few ferry duties in its first few months In 2005 another new vessel was purchased Spirit of Portsmouth This was fitted out with a covered top deck and a bar and to suit its cruise duties This meant that Solent Enterprise was no longer required by the Gosport Ferry service and she was sold to Capital Pleasure Boats in 2005 Her new owners renamed her Sundance and she operated on the River Thames in London as a charter vessel catering for parties corporate entertainment weddings and other functions Later she was sold again and moved to Copenhagen to be used as a floating cafe However in the early hours of the morning of 11 February 2016 a fire broke out on board completely engulfing the top deck and left her badly damaged Sundance was repaired and turned back into a houseboat but remains in Copenhagen today under new ownership

Architectural Design
Architectural Design also known as AD is a UKbased architectural journal first launched in 1930 as Architectural Design and Construction The journal is currently published by John Wiley  Sons and is edited by Helen Castle since 2001

In its early days the journal was more concerned with the British scene but it gradually became more international In 1946 Monica Pidgeon became editor and developed the magazine under the ownership of Standard Catalogue Company Contributors during the 1960s included Theo Crosby and Kenneth Frampton

It moved away from presenting mostly news towards themebased issues During the late 1970s and 1980s it was the bastion of Postmodernism with frequent articles and special editions guestedited by Charles Jencks the theoretical father of postmodern architecture At that time the journal was the mouthpiece of the publishers Academy Editions marketed in the USA under St Martins Press based in Leinster Gardens London they also had their own bookstore and they published very many wellknown titles concerned with postmodernism The longstanding EditorinChief until the mid1980s was Andreas Papadakis

The content of the journal is seen during the latter half of its history as running parallel with the cutting edge of avantgardism promoting innovation as well as celebrity status  stararchitects Thus at the height of Postmodernism in the late 1970s  when it often featured the works of Michael Graves Robert Stern Leon Krier James Stirling Robert Krier and Aldo Rossi  it also published Rem Koolhaass later influential book Delirious New York 1979 An undercurrent to Postmodernism featured in the journal was that of architecture without a style a vernacular classical architecture epitomised by the work of Quinlan Terry Demetri Porphyrios and John Simpson

The journal went partly into decline with the demise of postmodernism though it then shifted its coverage towards Deconstructivism folding in architecture blob architecture biomorphism and digital architecture The shift in emphasis can be pinpointed to a single edition of the journal devoted to the two polar positions at that time Peter Eisenman versus Leon Krier My ideology is better than yours Architectural Design 9101989 The current avantgardist interest of the journal in biomorphism is a return to issues the journal was covering in the 1960s and 1970s before posism with the architecture of Archigram Cedric Price and the thinking of Reyner Banham

The publication became part of John Wiley  Sons in 1997 when it acquired ADs German publisher VCH who had acquired the title from Andreas Papadakis Academy Editions in 1991

According to theatre critic Ken Mandelbaum Billy was a brassy Broadwaystyle musical and it took advantage of the services of topnotch American choreographer Onna White But its trump card was its star Michael Crawford Mandelbaum quoted the reviews The Daily Mail wrote There is no magic quite like being right there when a star is born and that was typical of the raves Crawford received But his vehicle was equally acclaimed The Daily Express called Billy the most successful British musical since Oliver while The Sunday People called it the brightest British musical for yearsits going to hoist brilliant Michael Crawford into the ranks of the superstars
