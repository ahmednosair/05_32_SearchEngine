        Stephens Media newspapers
        Stephens Media LLC was a Las Vegas Nevada diversified media investment company It owned stakes in the California
        Newspapers Partnership and the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette

        The company had been expanding its interactive Internet business operating online sites for its newspapers and
        portal sites like LasVegascom which is licensed to Greenspun Media Group The company is also a partner in the
        California Newspapers Partnership with MediaNews and Gannett The company also formed Northwest Arkansas
        Newspapers LLC in November 2009 a joint venture with WEHCO Media Inc in Arkansas

        On November 28 2010 Stephens Media Iowa LLC a subsidiary of Stephens Media acquired several newspapers including
        the Ames Tribune Boone NewsRepublican Dallas County News Nevada Journal Ames About People Advertiser TriCounty
        Times and Algona Upper Des Moines from Midlands Newspapers Inc a subsidiary of the Omaha WorldHerald Company In
        August 2011 the Algona Upper Des Moines was sold to Hallmark Media

        In February 2015 Stephens Media was purchased by GateHouse Media for 1028 million In December 2015 GateHouse
        sold the Las Vegas ReviewJournal the Stephens groups largest paper to casino magnate Sheldon Adelson for 140
        million

        The company was formerly called Donrey Media Group which was founded by Arkansas media mogul Donald W Reynolds
        and based in Fort Smith Arkansas After Reynolds died in 1993 at the age of 86 the company was sold to the
        Stephens family of Arkansas known for their Little Rock investment banking business Stephens Inc Some of Donreys
        properties were sold off and the company moved its headquarters to Las Vegas Nevada home of its largest
        newspaper the Las Vegas ReviewJournal The company was renamed Stephens Media Group in 2002 In June 2006 the
        company became known as Stephens Media LLC The company has no connection with Stephens Media Group a radio
        broadcasting company in Tulsa Oklahoma

        In 2010 Stephens Media contracted with the litigation firm Righthaven LLC giving it the power to enforce the
        companys copyrights when online violators go beyond the bounds of fair use More than 141 lawsuits have been
        filed in US District Court in Las Vegas since midMarch

        In a column published in the RJ shortly after the lawsuits began publisher Sherman Frederick said the primary
        goal with the partnership with Righthaven was to deter theft of the companys copyrighted materials He said if
        the company was successful he hoped Righthaven would find other media clients In late August WEHCO Media which
        owns the Arkansas DemocratGazette and the Chattanooga Times Free Press signed on with the firm MediaNews Group
        has also used Righthaven to file a copyright infringement suit

        The aggressive enforcement of the Stephens Media copyrights by Righthaven was being closely watched by other
        publishers as is the debate it has generated Critics of the relatively new practice have coined it copyright
        trolling and argue that the purpose of such enforcement is to make a profit In the Poynter article Stephens
        Media general counsel Mark Hinueber says the goal is to make sure the companys intellectual rights are protected
        We were seeing our entire work product in some stories just being rightclicked and cut and pasted into blogs
        where people were selling Google ads around them and making money The Las Vegas Sun has been thoroughly
        documenting Righthavens activities and the response The Suns outside law firm Lewis and Roca is defending
        several of the Righthaven suits

        Targets of the Righthaven lawsuits included bloggers political forums major political parties and several of the
        newspapers own sources including NORML DailyPaulcom Infowars Free Republic and others On August 25 2010 the
        Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF announced that they will make efforts to assist Righthaven LLC defendants to
        the best of their ability

        Righthavens lawsuits came under increasing judicial scrutiny which led to Righthaven being found in June 2011 to
        lack standing to sue for alleged infringement of copyrighted material to which it holds only a limited license
        as such a license does not confer the right to sue for infringement Sanctions against Righthaven and its
        attorney Steven A Gibson of Nevada law firm Dickinson Wright are currently being contemplated by one judge
        Righthaven later had its assets seized to pay judgments levied against it in lawsuits it filed against those
        whom it said infringed on the copyrights of clients As a result copyrights which had been sold by Stephens to
        Righthaven were sold back to Stephens for 80000 to pay legal fees

        In September 2009 Stephens Media and WEHCO Media Inc owner of the Arkansas DemocratGazette announced plans to
        combine their newspaper operations in Northwest Arkansas and operate as a single company The venture was
        approved in November 2009 by the US Justice Department and a new Arkansas Limited Liability Company Northwest
        Arkansas Newspapers LLC was formed Stephens Media sold its interest in the joint venture to WEHCO on May 5 2016
        which assumed control of all operations of the newspapers in the joint venture

        Newspapers in the joint venture include


        Arkansas

        Iowa
        Nevada

        North Carolina

        Henry Yesler
        Henry L Yesler December 2 1810 December 16 1892 was an entrepreneur and a politician regarded as a founder of
        the city of Seattle Yesler served two nonconsecutive terms as Mayor of Seattle and was the citys wealthiest
        resident during his lifetime

        Yesler arrived in Seattle from Ohio in 1852 and built a steampowered sawmill which provided numerous jobs for
        those early settlers and Duwamish tribe members The mill was located right on the Elliott Bay waterfront at the
        foot of what is now known as Yesler Way and was then known as Mill Road or the Skid Road so named for the
        practice of skidding greased logs down the steep grade from the everreceding timber line to the mill In running
        the mill Yesler built the citys first water system in 1854 The system was made up of a series of openair Vshaped
        flumes perched on stilts that started atop First Hill and ran down past Yeslers residence and to the mill Later
        on after complaints of dirty water Yesler developed a system made up of log pipes and iron buried beneath the
        ground
        In 1858 Yeslers wife Sarah joined him in Seattle and the couple lived in a simple house across from the mill
        Yesler also served in public office at various times as a county auditor county commissioner and mayor
        On June 6 1889 the Great Seattle Fire destroyed the entire business district which consisted mainly of wooden
        buildings including Yeslers sawmill Yeslers Hall a theater on the corner of and 1st Avenue and Yeslers Pavilion
        a civic center on 1st and Cherry Street They were never replaced In 1892 Yesler erected the Pioneer Building on
        the same plot of land where his first home stood now the heart of Seattles Pioneer Square Sarah Yesler had died
        in 1887 but Yesler built a large new mansion and shared his mansion with a younger female relative some sources
        describe her as a maid whom he married five months later
        Yesler died on December 16 1892 at the age of 82 He is buried in Seattles Lake View Cemetery After his death
        Yeslers mansion became the first home of the Seattle Public Library and burned down on January 2 1901 The King
        County Courthouse currently occupies the site

        In his informative and tongueincheek book Sons of the Profits columnist and Seattle historian William C Speidel
        pointed out some of Yeslers negative aspects On numerous occasions Yesler had lawsuits filed against him On
        other occasions it was Yesler himself doing the suing The City of Seattle made him a millionaire wrote Speidel
        yet he sued itfought itplundered itand on two occasions he brought it to the brink of bankruptcy Speidel also
        recounts how according to courthouse records Yesler owed John McLain an old friend from Ohio 30000 for the loan
        that the latter set up for construction of the mill Yesler would pay him 12000 of it over time and it wasnt
        until McLain sued him that he was able to collect on the rest
        Yesler and his wife Sarah were Spiritualists and believed in free love

        Egypt at the 1912 Summer Olympics
        The Egyptian Olympic Committee considers the nation to have first competed in the Summer Olympic Games at the
        1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm Sweden According to the official report the nation sent one fencer Ahmed
        Hassanein who competed in the individual foil and pe events There is uncertainty however as to whether he
        competed as the official report lists all entrants in fencing regardless of their actual participation and no
        results are known for Hassanein

        In 1912 Egypt was de jure under the control of the Ottoman Empire but had been de facto run by the British since
        1882 At the 1896 Summer Olympics an athlete by the name of Dionysios Kasdaglis competed in tennis and won silver
        medals in the singles and doubles tournaments Kasdaglis is listed as Greek by the IOC for the singles but in the
        doubles he and his Greek partner Demetrios Petrokokkinos are listed as a mixed team Kasdaglis had British
        citizenship but lived in Egypt and was a member of Egyptian clubs and thus he has been considered by some as an
        Egyptian Olympian Two athletes Arthur Marson and Eugenio Colombani competed under the Egyptian flag at the 1906
        Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized as Olympic by the International Olympic Committee IOC but were
        considered as such by contemporary sources The Egyptian Olympic Committee founded in 1910 considers Egypts first
        Olympic delegation to have been at the 1912 Summer Olympics which is supported by that years official report
        There is uncertainty however as to whether the fencer they sent Ahmed Hassanein actually competed as the
        official report lists all entrants in the fencing events regardless of their actual participation

        According to the official report Hassanein competed in both the individual foil and pe events In the former he
        was part of Pool XIV which included upcoming bronze medalist Richard Verderber of Austria and it is recorded
        only that he did not advance to the quarterfinals In the latter he was placed in Pool II which included eventual
        Olympic champion Paul Anspach of Belgium and again it is noted only that he did not make it out of the round
        Hassanein would go on to compete in both disciplines at the 1920 Summer Olympics and in pe in 1924 but never won
        a medal

        United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi
        The United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi BINUB was established by the United Nations Security Council to
        support the government of Burundi in its efforts towards longterm peace and stability and to replace the work of
        United Nations Operation in Burundi ONUB Its mandate was scheduled to begin on 1 January 2007 for an initial 12
        months and its creation and mission was as a result of recommendations in a report by the SecretaryGeneral

        The previous UN mission in Burundi ONUB was created to facilitate the implementation of the peace agreements
        signed between the previous government and the CNDDFDD rebel group The CNDDFDDs leader Pierre Nkurunziza went on
        to win the Burundian elections in 2005 and his party effectively controls the Burundian government

        The reasons for establishing a second mission in Burundi following directly on the ONUB missions was the
        ceasefire agreement reached between the new CNDDFDD government and the last remaining rebel group PalipehutuFNL
        This ceasefire agreement was signed on 7 September 2006 in Dar es Salaam Tanzania after mediation by South
        Africa in talks that began in May Among the key points in the agreement were a complete cessation of hostilities
        temporary immunity for FNL fighters and the demobilization of these troops and their subsequent integration into
        the armed forces of Burundi in line with earlier peace agreements in this conflict that all stipulated
        powersharing arrangements in the security sector

        The BINUB mission was created to facilitate the implementation of this ceasefire agreement with the most
        important point of the mandate being the support of the implementation of the modalities of the agreement
        assistance in the reform of the security sector and support of the reintegration of excombatants The Burundian
        government also requested the BINUB to help in the establishment of rule of law good governance and freedom of
        press and media

        The mandate of BINUB currently extends to the end of 2010

        It was replaced by the United Nations Office in Burundi BNUB on 1 January 2011

    <doc id="7728629" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7728629" title="Bamburgh Dunes">
        Bamburgh Dunes
        Bamburgh Dunes are a region of coastal sand dunes with an area of over 40 hectares situated around the village
        of Bamburgh in Northumberland England The dunes which stand in the shadow of the impressive Bamburgh Castle have
        been a Site of Special Scientific Interest SSSI since 1995 and are part of the North Northumberland Dunes
        Special Area of Conservation SAC The dunes have a rich diversity of flora and fauna and in places provide good
        examples of climbing dunes found where sand has been blown onto high ground adjacent to the beach

        Bamburgh Dunes vary from open sandy beaches through low ridges dominated by marram grass to more stable
        grasscovered dunes These occur as a series of irregular parallel sand ridges and hummocks separated by hollows
        which are seasonally wet Some of the plant species include the pyramidal orchid Centaurium sea sandwort and
        petalwort which is on the List of endangered species in the British Isles The dunes are also rich in rare insect
        life over 500 species have been identified including 15 rare species including a plant hopper Dicranotropis
        divergens a grassmining fly Opomyza punctata and a shore fly Psilopa marginella Birds attracted to the dunes
        include grasshopper warbler sedge warbler European stonechat meadow pipit and reed bunting In winter shorteared
        owl and water rail are also found

        Over the years more vigorous invasive plant species and scrub have encroached making the dune system too
        stabilised and threatening the uniqueness of Bamburgh Dunes most rare plant species appreciate the unstable and
        shifting structure of sand dunes In an effort to counteract this Bamburgh Castle Estate English Nature DEFRA
        Northumberland County Council and Bamburgh Parish Council have come up with a plan of management which has
        resulted in cattle being allowed to graze the dunes since 2000 to break up the dominant grass cover A fence has
        been erected to contain the cattle within the dunes access by people is encouraged within the fenced area with
        stiles and gates sited on the main paths
        An ancient AngloSaxon 7th century burial ground was unearthed in the dunes to the south east of Bamburgh Castle
        during an archaeological dig in 1998 by the Bamburgh Research Project The burial ground called the Bowl Hole had
        been known to exist since 1816 when violent storms removed large amounts of dune sand and uncovered the site for
        a period The BBC television programme Meet the Ancestors became involved during the dig and screened a programme
        about the finds in February 2001

        Loopswitch sequence
        A loopswitch sequence also known as the forcase paradigm or AntiDuffs Device is a programming antipattern where
        a clear set of steps is implemented as a switchwithinaloop The loopswitch sequence is a specific derivative of
        spaghetti code

        It is not necessarily an antipattern to use a switch statement within a loopit is only considered incorrect when
        used to model a known sequence of steps The most common example of the correct use of a switch within a loop is
        an inversion of control such as an event handler In event handler loops the sequence of events is not known at
        compiletime so the repeated switch is both necessary and correct see eventdriven programming event loop and
        eventdriven finite state machine

        This is not a performance antipattern though it may lead to an inconsequential performance penalty due to the
        lack of an unrolled loop Rather it is a clarity antipattern as in any nontrivial example it is much more
        difficult to decipher the intent and actual function of the code than the more straightforward refactored
        solution

        An eventdriven solution would implement a listener interface
        But without the listener it becomes an example of the antipattern
        And here is the refactored solution

        European Development Fund
        The European Development Fund EDF is the main instrument for European Union EU aid for development cooperation
        in Africa the Caribbean and Pacific ACP Group countries and the Overseas Countries and Territories OCT Funding
        is provided by voluntary donations by EU member states The EDF is subject to its own financial rules and
        procedures and is managed by the European Commission EC and the European Investment Bank

        Articles 131 and 136 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome provided for its creation with a view to granting technical and
        financial assistance to African countries that were still colonised at that time and with which certain
        countries had historical links

        Usually lasting 6 years each EDF lays out EU assistance to both individual countries and regions as a whole The
        EU is on its 10th EDF from 20082013 with a budget of 227 billion This represents about 30 of EU spending on
        development cooperation aid with the remainder coming directly from the EU budget

        The budget of the 10th EDF can be broken down as follows

        Negotiations for the 11th EDF would cover the period 20142020 This oneyear extension compared to the 10th EDF
        allowed the end of the 11th EDF to coincide with the expiration of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement in 2020 and
        the EU budget period The EDF has to date been funded outside the EU budget by the EU Member States on the basis
        of financial payments related to specific contribution shares or keys The Member State contributions keys are
        subject to negotiation The EDF is the only EU policy instrument that is financed through a specific key that is
        different from the EU budget key and which reflects the comparative interests of individual Member States

        There was a debate on whether to budgetise the EDF However in the Communication A budget for Europe 2020 the
        European Commission underlined that it was not appropriate at present time to propose that the EDF be integrated
        into the EU budget The perceived advantages include
        The perceived disadvantages are that

        In 2005 the EU and its Member States agreed to achieve a collective level of ODA of 07 of GNI by 2015 and an
        interim target of 056 by 2010 with differentiated intermediate targets for those EU Member States which had
        recently joined the Union On the 23rd of May 2011 EU ministers responsible for development cooperation gathered
        to take stock of progress made and concluded that additional efforts would be needed to close an estimated gap
        of 50 billion to reach the selfimposed collective EU target of 07 by 2015

        By 2015 the EU had not reached 07 of GNI though the commitment to this target was recently reaffirmed The
        commitment held no deadline Concord the European confederation for relief and development described the pledge
        as vague and nonbinding and said 2020 should be the new deadline

        The EUs Agenda for Change

        The European Commissions development strategy Agenda for Change puts inclusive and sustainable growth for human
        development at its centre Adopted in 2011 it adopted 2 reforms designed to make its development policy both more
        strategic and more targeted The Agenda for Change made new policies and rules for budget support The three main
        elements of this Agenda were

        1 Targeting and concentrating aid

        3 Other reforms for effectiveness joint programming common results framework innovative financing such as
        blending loans and grants and Policy Coherence for Development

        Programming the 11th European Development Fund

        The EU is currently implementing its 11th European Development Fund for the period 20142020 with an aid budget
        of 305 billion for many of the ACP countries and Overseas Countries and Territories OCTs covering both national
        and regional programmes Effectively programming the European Development Fund EDF is a major political policy
        and bureaucratic challenge involving multiple stakeholders namely the European Commission EC the European
        External Action Service EEAS 28 EU member states the European Parliament 74 governments from the Africa
        Caribbean and Pacific ACP group of states and domestic accountability actors

        Understanding the magnitude of the 11th EDF programming challenge is critical for three reasons

        1 The 11th EDF unfolds in a radically changed global context for development cooperation as the United Nations
        Sustainable Development Goals SDGs were agreed in September 2015

        2 The 11th EDF is the last before the Cotonou Partnership Agreement CPA between the EU and the countries of the
        ACP expires in 2020

        3 Programming and implementing the 11th EDF is a critical test of EU institutions that deal with external action
        and it tests the ability of EU development policy to achieve highimpact aid at a time when showing value for
        money is a high political priority at a time when many European governments follow a policy of fiscal austerity

        Independent research by the European Centre for Development Policy Management ECDPM a think tank based in
        Maastricht The Netherlands shows that the EU has ensured the effective translation into practice of two key
        policy commitments of the Agenda for Change namely a more focused strategy for less developed countries LDCs and
        lowincome countries LICs and the concentration of EU aid on a limited number of sectors and policy priorities
        Their research found that the high degree of compliance was achieved through toplevel support and tight control
        from headquarters

        While the principles of the Agenda for Change appear to have been followed ECDPM showed that in many countries
        initial programming proposals based on incountry consultations managed by EU Delegations were then superseded by
        the choices of EU headquarters in Brussels Although the 11th EDF is closely aligned with national development
        plans there is evidence that this topdown approach to programming has led to a significant erosion of key aid
        and development effectiveness principles in particular country ownership

        Critics

        The European Development Fund has been criticized because they can not prove what was purchased with the tsunami
        relief money

    <doc id="7728975" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7728975" title="Felixstowe F2">
        Felixstowe F2
        The Felixstowe F2 was a 1917 British flying boat class designed and developed by Lieutenant Commander John Cyril
        Porte RN at the naval air station Felixstowe during the First World War adapting a larger version of his
        superior Felixstowe F1 hull design married with the larger Curtiss H12 flying boat The Felixstowe hull had
        superior water contacting attributes and became a key base technology in most seaplane designs thereafter

        Before the war Porte had worked with American aircraft designer Glenn Curtiss on a flying boat America in which
        they intended to cross the Atlantic in order to win the 10000 prize offered by the British Daily Mail newspaper
        for the first aircraft to cross the Atlantic Following the outbreak of war in Europe Porte returned to England
        and rejoined the Royal Navy eventually becoming commander of the naval air station at Felixstowe where he
        recommended the purchase from Curtiss of an improved version of the America flying boat on which he had worked
        the Curtiss H4 type resulting in the RNAS receiving two prototype Americas and 62 H4s

        The Curtiss H4 was found to have a number of problems being both underpowered and having a hull too weak for
        sustained operations and having poor handling characteristics when afloat or taking off One flying boat pilot
        Major Theodore Douglas Hallam wrote that they were comic machines weighing well under two tons with two comic
        engines giving when they functioned 180 horsepower and comic control being nose heavy with engines on and tail
        heavy in a glide

        To try to resolve the H4s hydrodynamic issues in 1915 Porte carried out a series of experiments on four H4s
        fitted with a variety of modified hulls using the results of these tests to design a new hull which was fitted
        to the wings and tail of an H4 serial number 3580 with a pair of 150hp 112kW HispanoSuiza 8 engines as the
        Felixstowe F1 Rather than the lightweight boattype structure of the Curtiss boats the F1s hull was based around
        a sturdy wooden boxgirder similar to that used in contemporary landplanes to which were attached a singlestep
        planing bottom and side sponsons Once modified by the fitting of a further two steps the new hull proved to give
        much better take off and landing characteristics and was much more seaworthy

        Porte then designed a similar hull for the larger Curtiss H12 flying boat which while larger and more capable
        than the H4s shared failings of a weak hull and poor water handling The combination of the new Porte II hull
        this time fitted with two steps with the wings of the H12 a new tail and powered by two RollsRoyce Eagle engines
        was named the Felixstowe F2 its first flight was in July 1916 proving greatly superior to the Curtiss on which
        it was based The F2 entered production as the Felixstowe F2A being used as a patrol aircraft with about 100
        being completed by the end of World War I Another seventy were built and these were followed by two F2C which
        were built at Felixstowe

        In February 1917 the first prototype of the Felixstowe F3 was flown This was larger and heavier than the F2
        giving it greater range and heavier bomb load but poorer agility Approximately 100 Felixstowe F3s were produced
        before the end of the war

        The Felixstowe F5 was intended to combine the good qualities of the F2 and F3 with the prototype first flying in
        May 1918 The prototype showed superior qualities to its predecessors but the production version was modified to
        make extensive use of components from the F3 in order to ease production giving lower performance than either
        the F2A or F3

        The Felixstowe F2A was used as a patrol aircraft over the North Sea until the end of the war Its excellent
        performance and maneuverability made it an effective and popular type often fighting enemy patrol and fighter
        aircraft as well as hunting Uboats and Zeppelins The larger F3 which was less popular with its crews than the
        more maneuverable F2A served in the Mediterranean and the North Sea

        The F5 did not enter service until after the end of World War I but replaced the earlier Felixstowe boats
        together with Curtiss flying boats to serve as the RAFs standard flying boat until being replaced by the
        Supermarine Southampton in 1925

        Avraham Yehoshua Heshel of Apt popularly known as the Apter Rebbe or Apter Rov was born in migrd Poland in 1748
        and died in Mezhbizh Russian Empire now Ukraine in 1825

        A scion of famous rabbinic families on both his fathers and his mothers side his family can be traced back to
        Maharam Padua and Saul Wahl Avraham Yehoshua Heshel showed great promise even at an early age Acquiring fame as
        a talmudic scholar he studied under Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk and Rabbi Yechiel Michl of Zlotchov Becoming one
        of the foremost spokesmen of the growing Chasidic movement in Poland he began his career as Rabbi of Kolbuszowa
        In 1800 he accepted the post of Rabbi of Apt or Opatw Although he held many other rabbinic positions to the
        chasidim he remained always the Apter Rov In 1808 he was chosen as Rabbi of Iai Moldavia In the wake of communal
        strife there he was forced to leave his post and settled in Mezhbizh the home of the Baal Shem Tov and the
        cradle of Hasidism where he devoted himself completely to the study and dissemination of Chasidism

        It was during this period in his life in Mezhbizh that he gained the veneration of thousands of followers among
        whom were a number of the prominent rabbis of the age His outstanding character trait was his strongly expressed
        love of the Jewish people which earned him the title of Oheiv Yisrael Lover of Israel Oheiv Yisrael became the
        title of the published collection of his thoughts arranged according to the weekly Torah portions The work
        abounds with lofty kabbalistic insights and interpretations It is one of the basic chasidic texts and bespeaks
        the Apter Rovs passionate love of his fellow Jews The Apter Rov is one of the most notable and beloved
        luminaries in the hasidic firmament

        On his deathbed crying bitterly over the long exile he said Before his demise Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berdichev
        promised that upon entering the WorldtoCome he would not rest or sit until Mashiach would come But they diverted
        his attention by teaching him lofty and mystical concepts until he forgot his pledgebut I assure you I will not
        forget

        He was buried in Mezhbizh near the Baal Shem Tov An ornate stone ohel marks his grave in the old Jewish cemetery
        According to one hasidic legend angels subsequently carried his body and buried him in the Holy Land and in the
        Jewish Cemetery in Tiberias there is a stone marking his supposed grave

        Rabbi Avraham Yehoshua Heshel of Apt was the founder of the MezhbizhZinkover rabbinic dynasty In honor of the

        McLafferty rearrangement
        The McLafferty rearrangement is a reaction observed in mass spectrometry during the fragmentation or
        dissociation of organic molecules It is sometimes found that a molecule containing a ketogroup undergoes
        cleavage with the gain of the hydrogen atom as first reported by Nicholson working in the Division of Chemical
        Physics at the CSIRO in Australia This rearrangement may take place by a radical or ionic mechanism

        A description of the reaction was later published by the American chemist Fred McLafferty in 1959 leading to his
        name being associated with the process

        arrived at Minnesota as a linebacker but was switched to defensive tackle in 2001 During his junior season he
        led the team with 55 sacks Reid switched to defensive end in 2004 and again led Minnesota in sacks with 75 This
        effort gained him a spot on the 2004 AllBig Ten Second Team

        Reid was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Colts and spent time at the defensive tackle He filled in as a
        fullback in goal line situations and has played special teams

        Reid won Super Bowl XLI with the Colts in 2007

        million signing bonus and Reid could earn an additional 28 million through sack and playingtime incentives

        The mission of Darrell Reids Footz Foundation is to educate empower and inspire youth to believe and achieve
        promoting future success through lifes challenges The foundation partners with a variety of programs that
        provide opportunities for leadership development and academic achievement thereby enabling youth to positively
        impact their family school and community
        The Footz Foundation holds several annual events for the next generation and also holds youth football camps
        which also strive to teach life lessons I am privileged enough to have made it to the NFL I see it as my
        responsibility and a blessing to be able to pay it forward I love to help these kids out and see the smiles on
        their faces There is nothing better says Reid

        Pal Recording Studio
        Pal Recording Studio 19571964 was an independent recording studio that operated in Cucamonga California now
        known as Rancho Cucamonga The studio was started by engineerinnovator Paul Buff The studio is known for its
        instrumental Surf music recordings such as Wipe Out and the original demo recording of Pipeline The first
        location was at 8020 North Archibald Avenue Later the studio later moved down the street to 8040

        Pal was also the training ground for a young Frank Zappa who worked at the studio starting in 1961 Zappa learned
        basic recording techniques at Pal He recorded his first rock n roll record Breaktime by The Masters which
        consisted of himself Paul Buff and Ronnie Williams In 1964 Zappa bought the studio and renamed it Studio Z Zappa
        lived at the studio building for a few months before it was closed in 1965 The building had to be torn down in
        order to widen North Archibald Avenue

        Zappa made many other recordings at the studio Some were released by small Los Angeles record companies such as
        Original Sound Other recordings were kept in his vault and released on albums such as Lumpy Gravy 1968 Mystery
        Disc 1985 The Lost Episodes 1996 and Cucamonga 1998

        Paul Buff engineered the original demo recording of Pipeline by The Chantays and Wipe Out by The Surfaris using
        his unique custom built recording machine which recorded 5 tracks on 12inch recording tape Buff went on to
        invent the Kepex an acronym for KEyable Program EXpander the opposite of an audio compressor Paul Buffs Alison
        Research studio products became common on pop recordings Alan Parsons would use a Kepexed drum sound to create
        the heartbeat heard on Pink Floyds The Dark Side of the Moon

        In 2012 Crossfire Productions in partnership with Buff released a 5CDr collection containing 156 of Buffs PAL
        recordings entitled Paul Buff Presents Highlights From The Pal And Original Sound Studio Archives The collection
        featured 58 Zappainvolved recordings including an early version of Why Dont You Do Me Right which later appeared
        in 1967 as the Aside of a Mothers Of Invention single and the previously unreleased Zappa novelty song My Masked

        F2c
        f2c is a program to convert Fortran 77 to C code developed at Bell Laboratories The standalone f2c program was
        based on the core of the first complete Fortran 77 compiler to be implemented the f77 program by Feldman and
        Weinberger Because the f77 compiler was itself written in C and relied on a C compiler back end to complete its
        final compilation step it and its derivatives like f2c were much more portable than compilers generating machine
        code directly

        The f2c program was released as free software and subsequently became one of the most common means to compile
        Fortran code on many systems where native Fortran compilers were unavailable or expensive Several large Fortran
        libraries such as LAPACK were made available as C libraries via conversion with f2c The f2c program also
        influenced the development of the GNU g77 compiler which uses a modified version of the f2c runtime libraries

        Ohio State Route 372
        State Route 372 SR372 is a very short twolane eastwest state highway in the southern part of the US state of
        Ohio The western terminus of this spur route is at a Tintersection with the concurrency of US Route 23 US23 and
        SR104 about north of Waverly Its eastern terminus is just to the east of that point at the boundary of Scioto
        Trail State Forest Continuing east of that point is Stoney Creek Road which traverses through the state forest
        in the direction of the Scioto River From its inception in the middle of the 1930s the primary function of SR372
        has been to provide access to the state forest from the state highway system

        The entirety of SR372 is located within Franklin Township in rural southern Ross County Beginning at a
        Tintersection with the US23SR104 concurrency SR372 travels easterly into a series of curves in the shape of an S
        taking the route to the north and then bending to the southeast As it passes amidst heavily wooded terrain with
        some houses alongside the roadway SR372 travels past an intersection with North Ridge Road then abruptly comes
        to an end as it crosses the western boundary of Scioto Trail State Forest The roadway continues eastward from
        this point as Stoney Creek Road

        The Ohio Department of Transportation ODOT regularly does surveys to determine the amount of traffic that
        utilizes its highway system Commonly the volumes measured in these surveys are expressed in terms average annual
        daily traffic AADT or the amount of traffic volume on a given segment of a highway on any average day of the
        year In 2010 ODOT determined that an average of 340passenger vehicles per day and 20commercial vehicles per day
        used SR372 This state route is not a part of the National Highway System a network of roadways identified as
        being most important for the economy mobility and defense of the nation

        The SR372 designation was established in 1934 Throughout its entire history the highway has served to provide a
        connection to Scioto Trail State Forest from US23 When it was first designated all of SR372 was gravelsurfaced
        The state route was paved by 1958

        Threetier education
        Threetier education refers to those structures of schooling which exist in some parts of England where pupils
        are taught in three distinct school types A similar system was trialled in Scotland

        In a threetier authorities children begin their compulsory education in a first school Sometimes also called a
        lower school or more simply primary school these schools cater for children aged up to an age between 8 and 10
        and cover all of Key Stage 1 and the first years of Key Stage 2 Children then transfer to a Middle school These
        schools cater for children during a period of 3 to 4 years between the ages of 8 and 14 depending on the local
        authority These years cover parts of both Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 Following this children transfer to a high
        school sometimes known as an upper school for the remainder of their compulsory education and sometimes on into
        the sixth form

        Many local authorities trialled systems as this for a period from as early as 1968 with many more following suit
        during the early 1970s particularly in 1972 when the raising of school leaving age in England and Wales from 15
        to 16 saw many secondary schools lacking the adequate class space for 11 to 16yearolds

        However most have since reverted to align their schools to the National Curriculum

        Some LEAs reverted to the traditional age ranges as long ago as the late 1970s One of the first areas to revert
        to the traditional age ranges was Halesowen in the West Midlands which abandoned 59 first 913 middle and 131618
        secondary schools in 1982 after just 10 years in use

        No local authorities now maintain an exclusively threetier structure A number of authorities have a mix of
        standard twotier and threetier provision with middle schools Central Bedfordshire Worcestershire and the Royal
        Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Berkshire Leicestershire operates a threetier system in some areas with
        children moving from primary school into secondary school after year six and then to upper school after year
        nine

        In 2006 it was reported that Central Bedfordshire Northumberland and the Isle of Wight were the only LEAs still
        exclusively using the threetier system The London Borough of Harrow the city of Oxford and the counties of
        Dorset Norfolk Suffolk and Worcestershirelook up Bromsgrove and redditch largely used the system until the 2000s
        and their middle schools were either closed or converted to primary schools catering to children up to age 11

        A threetier system also exists in Gibraltar

        Presently the 13 intake mostly exists in the independent sector although some have followed their respective
        LEAs and adopted the 11 intake

        The main routes through education are shown in the diagram below with threetier routes being shown in blue and

        PHP accelerator
        A PHP accelerator is a PHP extension designed to improve the performance of software applications written in the
        PHP programming language

        Most PHP accelerators work by caching the compiled opcodebytecode of PHP representation of php files to avoid
        the overhead of parsing and compiling source code on each request some or even most of which may never be
        executed To further improve performance the cached code is stored in shared memory and directly executed from
        there minimizing the amount of slow disk reads and memory copying at runtime

        PHP accelerators substantially increase the speed of PHP applications Improvements of web page generation
        throughput by factors of two to seven have been observed

        The effect on application performance of opcode caching varies widely depending on factors such as the inherent
        execution time of the PHP application and the percentage of source code actually executed on a given request and
        whether additional optimization steps are performed While a code optimizer may even slow down overall
        performance when used in isolation it can provide an additional performance boost when coupled with a bytecode
        cache as the optimization effort is performed just once

        Medma
        Medma or Mesma Greek Steph B Strabo Scymn Ch but on coins and so Apollodorus of Damascus cited by Steph B Scylax
        has evidently a corruption for was an ancient Greek city of Southern Italy Magna Graecia on the west coast of
        the Bruttian now Calabrian peninsula between Hipponium and the mouth of the Metaurus probably todays River
        Petrace The site is located at Rosarno Province of Reggio Calabria Calabria

        It was a colony founded by the Epizephyrian Locrians and is said to have derived its name from an adjoining
        fountain But though it is repeatedly noticed among the Greek cities in this part of Italy it does not appear
        ever to have attained to any great power or importance It is probable however that the Medimnaeans who are
        noticed by Diodorus as contributing a body of colonists to the repeopling of Messana modern Messina by Dionysius
        in 396BCE are no other than the Medmaeans and that we should read in the passage in question Though never a very
        conspicuous place Medma seems to have survived the fall of many other more important cities of Magna Graecia and
        it is noticed as a still existing town both by Strabo and Pliny the Elder But the name is not found in Ptolemy
        and all subsequent trace of it disappears It appears from Strabo that the town itself was situated a little
        inland and that it had a port or emporium on the seashore

        The name of Mesima is still borne by a river which flows into the sea a little below Nicotera in the
        neighbourhood Nicotera the name of which is already found in the Antonine Itinerary probably arose after the
        decline of Mesma

    <doc id="7729277" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7729277" title="Random digit dialing">
        Random digit dialing
        Random digit dialing RDD is a method for selecting people for involvement in telephone statistical surveys by
        generating telephone numbers at random Random digit dialing has the advantage that it includes unlisted numbers
        that would be missed if the numbers were selected from a phone book In populations where there is a high
        telephoneownership rate it can be a cost efficient way to get complete coverage of a geographic area

        RDD is widely used for statistical surveys including election opinion polling and selection of experimental
        control groups

        An important consideration in random digit dialing surveys is bias introduced by nonresponders Nonresponse bias
        can be a problem if responders differ from nonresponders for the measured variables For example nonresponders
        may not have been contacted because they work multiple minimumwage jobs Various techniques are used to reduce
        the nonresponse rate such as multiple call attempts monetary incentives advance letters and leaving messages on
        answering machines because reducing the nonresponse rate may directly reduce nonresponse bias In addition when
        trying to calculate total error estimates response rate calculations can be imprecise because it can be
        difficult to determine whether certain telephone numbers are interviewable

        When the desired coverage area matches up closely enough with country codes and area codes random digits can be
        chosen within the desired area codes In cases where the desired region doesnt match area codes for instance
        electoral districts surveys must rely on telephone databases and must rely on selfreported address information
        for unlisted numbers Increasing use of mobile phones although there are currently techniques which allow
        infusion of wireless phones into the RDD sampling frame number portability and VoIP have begun to decrease the
        ability for RDD to target specific areas within a country and achieve complete coverage

        Axel Lindahl
        Axel Theodor Lindahl 27 July 1841 11 December 1906 was a Swedish photographer notable for his early photography
        of Norwegian landscapes

        Lindahl was born in Mariestad in southwestern Sweden With his brother Udo he opened his own photography studio
        in Uddevalla in 1865 within one year his work was exhibited in museums By around 1867 he had moved his business
        to Gothenburg Once established there he extended his interest to landscape photography focusing initially on the
        Swedish west coast and then moving into Norway In 1883 he sold his interest in the studio in Sweden and made
        Norwegian landscapes his exclusive area of business working closely with the publisher Rich Andvord

        Unlike many of his contemporary photographers who emphasized the dramatic nature of Norwegian landscapes Lindahl

        Bohemian Society of Sciences
        Bohemian Society of Sciences is the first official scientific organization within Bohemia

        The Bohemian Society of Sciences was created from the Private Society for Mathematics Patriotic History and
        Natural History the first scientific society within the frontiers of the later Czechoslovakia This organization
        was founded in 1772 and published six volumes of its proceedings before becoming the Bohemian Society of
        Sciences and then later becoming the Royal Bohemian Scientific Society in 1784 Its members included Masons and
        Illuminatis and the Royal Bohemian Scientific Society it later established some ties with the Private Scientific
        and Patriotic Society of Moravia

        In the early 18th century the institution began to become partially due to its usage of both Czech and German
        languages which caused it to lose some of the more radical Czech scientists while the creation of the Vienna
        Academy caused the loss of some of the Germanspeaking scientists By 1847 members of the Royal Bohemian Society
        of Sciences moved to the Vienna Academy however some of the members moved to other academies Members moving to
        academies other than the Vienna Academy included Palack afak Zippe Presl and Purkyn

        After 1847 the sciences have continued to play a role in the Czech state continuing through the creation of the
        Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts which was created in 1890 through a decree issued by Emperor Franz Joseph
        which existed among many other institutions During the Second World War most scientific research was halted due
        to the Nazi occupation but was restarted in 1952 with the creation of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences which
        continues to operate today

        The Physics of Star Trek
        The Physics of Star Trek is a 1995 nonfiction book by the theoretical physicist Lawrence M Krauss It is the
        third book by Krauss who later wrote a followup titled Beyond Star Trek in 1997

        Krauss discusses the physics involved in various concepts and objects described in the Star Trek universe He
        investigates the possibility of such things as inertial dampers and warp drive and whether physics as we know it
        would allow such inventions He also discusses time travel light speed pure energy beings wormholes teleportation
        and other concepts that are staples of the Star Trek universe The book includes a foreword by astrophysicist
        Stephen Hawking

        The Physics of Star Trek was met with generally positive reviews It became a national bestseller and sold more
        than 200000 copies in the United States As of 1998 it was being translated into 13 different languages It was
        also the basis of a BBC television production

        Krauss got the idea for writing the book from his publisher who initially suggested it as a joke Krauss
        dismissed the idea but later thought that using Star Trek might get people interested in real physics

        The hardcover edition was published in November 1995 and a paperback edition followed in September 1996 The book
        was revised and updated by Krauss in 2007 Krausss next book Beyond Star Trek Physics from Alien Invasions to the

        Concordia was designed by Ryszard Langer and owned by the West Island College Class Afloat program Her port of
        registry was Bridgetown Barbados but she was based in Lunenburg Nova Scotia On 5 December 1996 an explosion on
        board during battery charging resulted in the death of a crewmember

        On 17 February 2010 SV Concordia encountered what the vessels Captain called a microburst some southeast of Rio
        de Janeiro Brazil in rough seas and high winds The vessel was knocked onto its side within 15 seconds and
        eventually sank 20 minutes afterward

        In September 2011 the Transportation Safety Board of Canada report found The wind speeds experienced by the
        vessel at the time of the knockdown were most likely in the range of While there was probably a vertical
        component to the wind there is no evidence that a microburst occurred at the time of the knockdown The report
        also found the vessel was operated in a way that did not allow it to react to changing weather conditions
        appropriately and maintain the stability of the vessel

        All aboard successfully abandoned ship As the capsizing was so fast no radio distress call was made but an EPIRB
        was hydrostatically released and automatically activated when the vessel sank

        The Concordia sank at 1423 hrs local time Wednesday At 1425 Concordias Bosun Geoffrey Byers swam to retrieve the
        EPIRB and brought it aboard the rafts The Captain directed that someone hold the EPIRB upright at all times and
        keep it safe from damage The EPIRB signal was received at 1505 hrs by the Geostationary Operational
        Environmental Satellite GOES 12 The position of the sinking was resolved at 1525 local time The TSB report noted
        the EPIRB database only listed one telephone number for the Concordia and that number had not been in service
        since 2004

        The following morning at 0806 hrs the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre Brazil sent a fax to Joint Rescue
        Coordination Centre Halifax requesting information about the Concordia
        After attempting to contact Concordia a Brazilian Air Force aircraft was dispatched at 17 hrs local time
        Thursday and sighted the liferafts 3 hours later

        The survivors spent nearly 30 hours in liferafts before the aircraft spotted them Flares were fired from the
        rafts and the aircraft blinked its landing lights in response and directed nearby merchant ships to the scene

        province Serbia The village numbers 6181 people census 2011 and has the largest ethnic Macedonian population in
        Serbia by percentage

        meant apple of Torontl The German name official name Apfeldorf from March 1943 to September 1944 meant apple
        village A legend tells about Serbian fishermen who settled nearby an apple tree The legend was published for the
        first time in 1912 There is no deed or other written evidence of the founding by the first settlers

        Jabuka is located on flat and fertile plain nearby the Tami river at approximately 11 km NW of Panevo and 27 km
        NE of Panevo bridge to Belgrade

        In the 1970s a team of the Archaeological Institute of Belgrade carried out extensive excavations on the
        communal area The scientists found objects and tracks of a temporary settlement of Neolithic Vina and Starevo
        cultures Chalcolithic Baden culture and Iron periods

        The communal area was a part of Temevar Eyalet in Ottoman Empire since 1552 after the Treaty of Poarevac a part
        of Habsburgs Banat since 1765 of the military frontier Austrian Empire and then it belonged to the Torontl
        county of AustriaHungary After World War I was that area a part of provisional Torontalskotamike upanja Treaty

        time after World War II its belonged to the Srez Panevo of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
        Federal Republic of Yugoslavia The communal area of Jabuka was a part of the administrative region of the Panevo
        municipality from all these centuries to the present

        In December 1764 a military commission of Viennese Hofkriegsrat registered 88 Rascian people Austrian German
        Serbs who lived in 69 more or less habitable houses and in the following years Germans settled in the entire
        region organized by Habsburg administration

        In 1858 the parson Silvester Jablonsky wrote into the fragmentary history book of the Catholic parish community
        a glorious appearance of the sky was visible during most of the summer time

        In 1921 the population of the village numbered 3265 inhabitants including 2819 Germans 348 Romanians 73
        Hungarians 20 Serbs or Croats 2 Slovenes 2 Russians and 1 Englishman

        In 1944 one part of German population left from the region together with defeated German army The remaining
        Germans of the village were sent to local imprisonments which existed until 1948 After prison camps were
        dissolved many of German population left Yugoslavia because of economic reasons

        In the time period after World War II the village was settled with families that originated from all parts of
        Yugoslavia Most of the settlers were from Macedonia many of them originating from Kriva Palanka Municipality In
        1948 the majority of inhabitants were Macedonians 2806 or 6388

        On 9 May 1768 Joseph II wrote an impression of the structural condition of the village during his inspection of
        the new part of southern military frontier into his diary Jabuka is the worst of them all At the instigation of
        Viennese Hofkriegsrat and after approval of the financing by Viennese Hofkammer the village was new created and
        built up until 1774 There is a historical plan of the new village which is kept at the Austrian National
        Archives At the beginning of the 19th century cotton was planted on a trial basis in the northern Jabuka area
        but it was stopped because of longterm profitability reasons In 1808 Archduke Ludwig opened a fruit plant
        nursery which existed until 1873 There is an impression of the old village and the plant nursery German
        Obstgarten Plantage which is recorded on the map of the Franciscan land survey from the early 19th century at
        the National Archives of Austria In 1905 cadastral maps of the village were recorded which are kept at the
        National Archives of Hungary In 1910 the village consisted of 675 buildings 478 made of stones or bricks 147
        made of air dried bricks or clay with stone or brick foundation and 50 made of timber or other materials 627
        buildings had roofs made of tiles slate or sheet metal and 48 made of thatched reeds or straw
        From 1959 to 1960 the old Roman Catholic Church was demolished due to dilapidated and damp foundations A part of
        the dry bricks was used for construction and renovation of new and old houses of the village The Church was
        built from 1771 to 1774 in neoclassical stile and renovated from 1829 to 1833 On 14 November 1833 a deed of
        renovation history was sealed in a niche on the ground in front of the altar during the consecration ceremony
        After the demolition of the last remains of the foundation walls the historical deed was handed over by the
        governmental authorities of the village to the Diocese of Zrenjanin The church was dedicated to Saint Leopold
        and stood on the place on which the modern school extension including sports hall is now The extension was
        opened in school year 196162

        In 1901 the small Orthodox church was built Before completion of the church the Orthodox residents 369 Vlachs
        and 13 Serbs in 1890 had to go to the churches of the competent parish communities in Sefkerin or Panevo The

        The building is built of whitewashed cement and stucco

        Casapueblo is a building constructed by the Uruguayan artist Carlos Pez Vilar It is located in Punta Ballena
        from Punta del Este Uruguay It was originally a summer house and workshop of the artist It now houses a museum
        an art gallery a cafeteria and a hotel It was the permanent residence of its creator where he worked and spent
        his last days

        It was built around a wooden house made with planks found on the coast called La Pionera The Pioneer by Carlos
        Pez Vilar Although the style can be compared with the houses of the Mediterranean coast of Santorini the artist
        often evoked the nest of the hornero a bird typical to Uruguay when discussing the style of construction The
        building which took 36 years to complete has thirteen floors with staggered terraces that allow one to have
        optimal views of sunset on the waters of the Atlantic ocean

        It pays tribute to his son Carlos Miguel one of the seventeen Uruguayan survivors of the crash of Uruguayan 571

        Epic of evolution
        In social cultural and religious studies the epic of evolution is a narrative that blends religious and
        scientific views of cosmic biological and sociocultural evolution in a mythological manner According to Taylors
        Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature an epic of evolution encompasses
        Epic of evolution seems to have originated from the sociobiologist Edward O Wilsons use of the phrase
        evolutionary epic in 1978 Wilson was not the first to use the term but his prominence prompted its usage as the
        morphed phrase epic of evolution In later years he also used the latter term

        Naturalistic and liberal religious writers have picked up on Wilsons term and have used it in a number of texts
        These authors however have at times used other terms to refer to the idea Universe Story Brian Swimme John F
        Haught Great Story Connie Barlow Michael Dowd Everybodys Story Loyal Rue New Story Thomas Berry Al Gore Brian
        Swimme and Cosmic Evolution Eric Chaisson

        Evolution generally refers to biological evolution but here it means a process in which the whole universe is a
        progression of interrelated phenomena a gradual process in which something changes into a different and usually
        more complex form emergence It should not be biologized as it includes many areas of science In addition outside
        of the scientific community the term evolution is frequently used differently from scientists usage Even
        respected dictionaries may present questionable definitions that are not scientific or only address genetic
        changes Unfortunately it is common for the general public to enter into a discussion about evolution with a
        wrong definition in mind This often leads to misunderstanding since scientists are viewing evolution from a
        different perspective The same applies to the use of the term theory as used in the theory of evolution see
        references for Evolution as theory and fact

        This epic is not a long narrative poem but a series of events that form the proper subject for a laudable kind
        of tale It is mythic in that it is a story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the
        worldview of a people and explains a natural phenomenon It is a form of myth that has an approach to
        investigation that is empirical or scientific According to Joseph Campbell myths serve two purposesprovide
        meaning for a maturing individual an individuate and how to be part of a community This Epic does both

        Dr William Grassie of Temple University writes that the word myth in common usage is usually misunderstood In
        academia it defines a story that serves to define the fundamental world view of a culture by explaining aspects
        of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society He suggests
        that the Greek term mythos would be a better term to apply to the Epic as it is more allencompassing He
        concluded that there is not yet an interpretive tradition within science and society about this epic of
        evolution If anything there is an antiinterpretation tradition Consequently this is dangerous as it is a
        powerful revelation at this time Grassie says the Epic is complex and multifaceted not simple or easy to
        understand It takes a romantic vision philosophical rigor and artistic interpretations It requires a consilience
        of modern disciplines and acceptance of social diversity The ancient wisdoms of the worlds spiritual traditions
        must be adapted to make the framework to weave the Epic

        E O Wilson explained that humans had a need for the epic of evolution because they must have a mythical story or
        a sublime account of how the world was created and how humanity became part of it Religious epics fulfill a
        primal need in this respect as they verify that humans are part of something greater than themselves The best
        empirical knowledge that science and history can provide is necessary in order to provide a comparable epic tale
        that will reliably unite a separated human spirituality He believes the evolutionary epic can be as inherently
        noble as any religious epic when it is expressed in a poetic way In a similar vein biologist Ursula Goodenough
        sees the tale of natural emergence as far more magical than traditional religious miracles It is a story that
        people can work with in a religious way if they elect to do so

        Philip Hefner uses the analogy of weaving to describe the Epic The warp anchors the story and the weft creates
        the pattern and the tapestry The Epic as scientists see it is the warp and the weft forms the pattern as each of
        us views it we are all weavers but the patterns all have the warp in common Hefner writes that stories about the
        evolutionary epic are redolent with ultimacy It is not science it is scientifically informed myth a myth driven
        by the refusal to give up on the insistence that the natural world and our lives in the world have meaning and
        purpose It is a mythical tale of irony and hope that fills a large space in the domain of religionandscience
        Biologist Ursula Goodenough also makes use of Hefners weaving metaphor

        Connie Barlow and Michael Dowds Great Story divides the epic into 8 phases eons or eras the Great Radiance the
        Galactic Hadean Archean Proterozoic Paleozoic Mesozoic and Cenozoic Dowd uses the term epic of evolution to help
        construct his viewpoint of evolution theology a form of theistic evolution His position is that science and
        religious faith are not mutually exclusive He preaches that the epic of cosmic biological and human evolution
        revealed by science is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe Evolution is
        viewed as a spiritual process that it is not meaningless blind chance

        Loyal Rue states that there is nothing in the core of everybodys story to rule out belief in a personal deity
        However belief in God is not an indispensable part of this narrative and here will be both theistic and
        nontheistic versions of it He says it is the fundamental story of matter created from energy the organization of
        that matter into complex conditions and then via selforganization into diverse life forms Humans are as other
        living thingswe are by nature starborn earthformed fitnessmaximized biochemical systems An aspect of the Epic is
        the evolution of behavior by that biochemical system

        Brian Swimme sees the Epic as a way to gently maneuver a person into the magnificence of the Universe and as an
        antidote to the unhealthy consciousness of consumerism It is the way into the future and enabled him to
        comprehend the cultural significance of this new story of science moving away from a materialistic worldview It
        may move science away from its traditional abstractness to the uniqueness found in natural history To him
        evolution and creativity are equivalent so it could be the Epic of Creativity similar to Gordon Kaufmans
        thinking Although the Epic is scientific it is definitely mythicit has the fundamental nature of being mythic
        You take hydrogen gas and you leave it alone and it turns into rosebuds giraffes and humans

        Gordon D Kaufman sees the Epic as a serendipitous creative process He states that it is a notion that can
        interpret the enormous expansion and complexification of the physical universe from the Big Bang outward as well
        as the evolution of life here on earth and the gradual emergence of human historical existence The whole vast
        process manifests in varying degrees serendipitous creativity an everflowing coming into being of new modes of
        reality In his book In the beginningcreativity he says this creative process is God Creativity as metaphor and
        as defined in the concept of evolution has possibilities for constructing a new concept of God The most
        foundational kind of creativity is found in that of cosmosbiological evolutiona paradigm that is now the
        organizing principle of all the sciences It would seem as though he was equating God to the evolutionary story
        This is similar to Dowd who sees the facts of Nature as Gods native tongue

        Eric Chaisson orients his view of the epic around an arrow of time which he divides into Seven Ages of the
        Cosmos particulate galactic stellar planetary chemical biological and cultural However such a thermodynamic
        arrow is not intended to be directional a common misunderstanding he sees no purpose plan or design in evolution
        which he regards as unceasing uncaring and unpredictable Chaissons strictly scientific analysis of evolution in
        its broadest sensecosmic evolutionimplies an unidirectional meandering process extending from the big bang to
        humankind on Earth and continuing while likely producing increasing complexity perhaps forever to ends unknown
        As a physicist he is perhaps best known for attempting to quantify the epic of evolution using the currently
        known laws of science and the scientific method with its insistence on experimental tests of all ideas
        principally those of energy rate density in order to empirically discriminate between objective sense and
        subjective nonsense What emerges is a grand and inspiring scientific narrative of who we are and whence we
        camethe most recent and uptodate version of this work having been summarized in a long peerreview article

        Bron Taylors Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature gives four primary categories cosmic planetary life cultural

        The creationevolution controversy goes beyond the field of evolutionary biology and includes many fields of
        science cosmology geology paleontology thermodynamics physics and sociobiology

        Although in the scientific community there is essentially universal agreement that the evidence of evolution is
        overwhelming and the consensus supporting the neoDarwinian evolutionary synthesis is nearly absolute
        creationists have asserted that there is a significant scientific controversy and disagreement over the validity
        of the evolution epic

        The debate is sometimes portrayed as being between science and religion However as the National Academy of
        Sciences states

        DrJohn Haught Roman Catholic theologian in his Science and Religion from Conflict to Conversation suggests a
        theistic acceptance of the Epic He says contemporary theology is being changed by evolutionary science There are
        many versions undergoing constant revision He considers evolution to be at least provisionally a most
        appropriate and fruitful scientific framework within which to think about God today and deplores that
        contemporary theology gets hung up in the creationism controversy There are liberal congregations these days
        that may see the epic of evolution as a history about life and the universe that is both scientific and sacred
        The profoundly sacred elements of the story warm up the cold technical facts with awe and reverence giving
        Nature an inspiring beauty

        Eric Chaisson in his book Epic of Evolution concludes that the coherent story of cosmic evolutiona powerful and
        noble effortmay perhaps be the way to ethical evolution in the new millennium Although his is a decidedly
        materialistic view of the evolutionary epic he recognizes more than most scientists that humanity is part of
        this grand story and that we have a responsibility to survive as the only sentient intelligent beings known in
        the universe

        Not all of the Epics advocates are distinguished scientists Some are Christians who consider it a narrative of
        mythic proportions that contain religious aspects They see it as a multifaceted concept that has been in
        Christian theology implicitly for hundreds of years and is congenial to perspectives that include ultimacy
        transcendence purpose and morality However there are both humanists and creationists who dispute this stance
        making unclear the many varied theological stories of our world

        In 1996 the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science held a conference on the epic of evolution In 1997 the
        American Association for the Advancement of Science organized a conference on the epic of evolution as part of
        their program on Dialogue on Science Ethics and Religion In July 1999 The Forum on Religion and Ecology with
        special support from the Center for Respect of Life and Environment sponsored a conference titled The Epic of
        Evolution and World Religions It consisted of a small invitational gathering of scholars of the worlds religious
        traditions as well as a number of scientists and educators It explored how the creation stories of the worlds
        religions intersect with or react to the epic of evolution An Evolutionary Epic conference was held in Hawaii in
        January 2008 It was attended by scientists artists educators and spiritual and religious leaders

        Washington University in St Louis offers a course on the epic of evolution The Epic has also been taught at
        Northern Arizona University The course engaged the task of formulating a new epic myth that is based on the
        physical natural social and cultural sciences for which there are as yet few textbooks The course was presented
        in three segments the cosmos before humans appeared the human phenomenon and scenarios for the future of
        evolution An annual undergraduate course on cosmic evolution has been taught at Harvard University for most of
        the past 35 years

        Evolution Sunday a Christian church event 1044 Congregations observed it in 2009 arose from the Clergy Letter
        Project signed in 2004 by 10500 American clergy It is spreading internationally and across other faiths It
        supports the story of evolution in a manner similar to the Epic science and religion compatibility promoting
        serious discussion and reflection on the relationship between religion and science For far too long strident
        voices in the name of Christianity have been claiming that people must choose between religion and modern
        science says Michael Zimmerman founder of Evolution Sunday and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
        at Butler University in Indianapolis Were saying you can have your faith and you can also have science

        written up in a major article in Life Magazine about 1960 as the wave of the future Lincoln Village was built
        near the Columbus factories for Westinghouse and General Motors The model homes for Lincoln Village were the
        first few homes on the west side of Redmond Road The development is newer than the homes on roads to its west
        from Woodlawn Avenue to New Rome and from South Grener Avenue to I270 Another highlight of the neighborhood was
        the wellknown Lincoln Lodge Motel which included a golf course which was at the northwest corner of North Murray
        Hill Road and West Broad Street

        The general area is home to several older buildings and contains apartment complexes and stores Popular stores
        in or near the neighborhood are KFC CVS and the Home Depot Lincoln Village South is home to Stiles Elementary
        School Stiles is home to children from Lincoln Park Murray Hill and Cherry Creek The school has been criticized
        recently because it was found that during the 20052006 school year 31 of the children at Stiles could not speak
        English Stiles is 26 Hispanic 25 AfricanAmerican 44 White and 5 mixed races This is a huge change from the all
        white WASP neighborhood it was in the 1960s Stiles has played a large role in the history and story of the
        neighborhood

        Like most West Columbus neighborhoods Murray Hill has problems with crime It receives policing from the Columbus
        Division of Police Precinct 10 Franklin Township Police Department and the Franklin County Sheriffs Department
        Popular gangs in Murray Hill are the 420 High Rydas divisions of both the Blood and Crip gangs and various
        Hispanic gangs

        Susanna Fontanarossa
        Susanna of Fontanarossa 14351489 was the mother of navigator and explorer Christopher Columbus
        Sussana was born in the hillside village of Monticellu on the then Genoese island of Corsica to a wealthy
        Catholic family Her family owned substantial real estate in Quezzi a little village in the lowlying valley of
        Bisagno part of the presentday city of Genoa She married Domenico Colombo in 1445 and bore him 5 children
        Cristoforo Bartolomeo Giovanni Giacomo and a daughter named Bianchinetta

        A notarised document of sale in the Genoa state archive contains the Latinate text Sozana quondam de Jacobi de
        Fontana Rubea uxor Dominici de Columbo de Ianua ac Christophorus et Pelegrinus filii eorum which can be
        translated as Susanna was the daughter of Giacomo from Fontanarossa of the Bisagno wife of Domenico Columbus
        from Genoa their sons are Cristoforo and Pellegrino The was a significant inland district in the ancient
        Republic of Genoa including the valley of the Bisagno Thus she was described as Susanna from Fontanarossa within
        the Val Bisagno rather than Suzanna Fontarossa

        Today the hilltop village of Fontanarossa Goretto Genova Liguria in the Val Trebbia 31km inland from Genoa at
        and only 6km beyond the watershed of the river Bisagno has a marble stone with the inscription Susanna
        Fontanarossa the mother of Christopher Columbus was born in this village In questo borgo nacque Susanna
        Fontanarossa madre di Cristoforo Colombo

        Little is known about her after 1484 She died before her husband Domenico

    <doc id="7731402" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7731402" title="Third Order of Saint Dominic">
        Third Order of Saint Dominic
        The Third Order of Saint Dominic properly referred to as the Lay Fraternities of St Dominic or Lay Dominicans
        since 1972 is a Roman Catholic third order affiliated with the Dominican Order

        Lay Dominicans are men and women singles and couples living a Christian life with a Dominican spirituality in
        the secular world They find inspiration following the same spiritual path taken by many saints blesseds and
        other holy men and women throughout the 800year history of the Dominican Order The Life of a Dominican layperson
        is all about having a passion for the Word of God It is about committing one self to a community of like minded
        brothers and sisters that immerse themselves in the Word of God There are Lay Dominican Provinces all around the
        world

        This was one of the earliest developments of the ancient Ordo de Poenitentia Order of Penance This was a status
        which developed in the ancient Church in which those faithful who sought a more dedicated way of life embraced
        the lifestyle of a penitent then in effect in the Church It was not the organization from which the Friars
        Preachers evolved but rather represents that portion of the Order of Penance which came under Dominican
        influence At first vaguely constituted and living without system or form its members gradually grew more and
        more dependent on their spiritual guides

        Friar Munio of Zamora the seventh Master General of the Friars Preachers formulated a definite Rule for these
        lay penitents in 1285 By this the Ordo de Poenitentia was to be ruled in each local center by a Dominican priest
        and was to be subject to the obedience of the Dominican priors provincial and Masters General Henceforward this
        branch was linked to the fortunes of the Friars Preachers and wore their habits of black and white with few
        minor differences varying according to time and country They were not specifically called a third order until
        after papal recognition in 1405 but continued to be known as the Brothers and Sisters of Penance of St Dominic

        A military order called the Militia Jesu Christi soldiery of Jesus Christ also became a part of the third order
        It owed its origin to Bishop Foulques of Toulouse Simon de Montfort and probably to St Dominic then a canon
        regular This connection with the founder of the Friars Preachers is first discussed in documents relating to the
        Blessed Raymund of Capua who became a Dominican about 1350 As early as 1235 Pope Gregory IX confided the Militia
        to the care of Friar Jordan of Saxony second Master General by a Bull of 18 May and in the same year he decreed
        a habit of black and white for the knights Further when the Militia was brought across the Alps and established
        in Italy it is found to be always connected with some Dominican church Lastly it was very largely influenced by
        a famous Dominican Friar Bartolomeo of Braganza or of Vicenza as he is sometimes called

        Originally working side by side and independent of each other because both received the same spiritual
        administration of the Friars Preachers they appear to have been merged at the close of the 13th century So too
        their ultimate merging is hinted at by Honorius III in 1221 when he designates the Militia nomine poenitentiae
        and a comparison also of the rules of the two institutions that of Pope Gregory for the Militia in 1235 and that
        of Munio de Zamora for the Order of Penance of St Dominic in 1285 would lead one to the same conclusion The only
        considerable difference that could be cited against this identify is that Munio of Zamora expressly forbids the
        carrying of arms But this is in reality but a further proof of their approximation for he allows for the one
        exception which could possibly apply to the Militia viz in defence of the Church This amalgamation is admitted
        by the Bollandists to have become general in the 14th century

        From this double movement therefore ie from the Ordo de Poenitentia S Dominici and the Militia Jesu Christi was
        born the modern Third Order of St Dominic Though its source is therefore anterior to the First Order its full
        perfection as an organized society with a distinctive habit a definite rule and a declared ethos or spirit is
        due to the genius of the children of St Dominic They took an ancient institution and with their characteristic
        love of order and systematic arrangement brought it into something compact and symmetrical From them this idea
        of subjection to a First Order was taken up by the Franciscans and has been adopted by all subsequent Third
        Orders

        The work of the Third Order is to engage laypeople to help in reform of church discipline Its initial purpose
        was the preaching of penance but under Dominican influences it leaned to the intellectual aspect of the Faith
        and based its message to the world on the exposition of the Creed it was to reform Church discipline by the more
        widespread knowledge of the mysteries of faith It also helped to defend the Church and to develop the communion
        of prayer The medieval ideal of Christs Mystical Body which has captivated all spiritualminded people implies a
        harmony of prayer To achieve this end the contemplative and monastic orders were begun and the Third Order of St
        Dominic endeavours to link pious souls to this great throng of religious Proctor The Dominican Tertiarys Daily
        Manual London 1900 1520

        Only for one period in its history was there any real fear of suppression Many held that the condemnation passed
        on the Beguines and Beghards at the Council of Vienna in 1312 applied no less to the Orders of Penance In
        consequence the mastergeneral petitioned Pope John XXII in 1326 to settle definitely the difficulty As a result
        he answered by a Bull of 1 June 1326 Cum de Mulieribus which is a long eulogium on the work of the Dominican
        Third Order

        After the plague of 1348 a great deal of laxity and disorganization crept into the Third Order but a wonderful
        throng of saints soon caused its rejuvenation The influence of St Catherine of Siena gave a powerful impetus to
        the movement in Italy and her work was carried on by Bl Clara Gambacorta died 1419 and Bl Maria Mancini died
        1431 This new spiritual vigour reached across the Alps to the sisterhoods of Germany where the effect was almost
        abnormal Heimbucher Die Orden und Kongregationen der katholischen Kirche Paderborn 1907 II 169177 But there has
        never been any reform in the sense of a separate organization with a change of rule or habit As in the First
        Order there has been a peculiar gift of unity which has enabled it to last undivided for seven hundred years

        The Third Order as it exists today can be divided into two categories regular ie comprising Tertiaries whether
        men or women who live in community and wear the habit externally and secular ie whether married or single cleric
        or lay who live their lives like others of their profession but who privately take up practices of austerity
        recite some liturgical Office and wear some symbol of the Dominican habit

        The origin of the conventual women Tertiaries has never been very clearly worked out It is usual to trace them
        back to Emily Bicchieri about the year 1255 But if the view taken above of the origin of the Third Order in the
        Ordo de Poenitentia be correct we are forced to the conclusion that the communities of women established by St
        Dominic at Prouille S Sisto etc were really of this Third Order Their constitutions approved first for S Sisto
        though previously observed at Prouille expressly speak of the nuns as de Poenitentia S Mariae Magdalenae It
        would seem then that the Ordo de Poenitentia did not exclude convents of enclosed nuns from its ranks and this
        was due probably to St Dominic himself

        Very much later came a conventual order of men originated by the genius of Pre Lacordaire He considered that the
        democratic spirit of the Dominican Order fitted it especially for the task of training the youth But he knew how
        impossible it was for his preaching associates to tie themselves down to schoolwork among boys as a consequence
        he began in 1852 a Third Order of men wearing the habit living in community yet without the burdens of monastic
        life The rule was approved provisionally in 1853 and definitely in 1868

        But by far the greatest portion of the Third Order consists of secular Tertiaries These are of every rank of
        society and represent the old Ordo de Poenitentia and the old Militia In certain countries they are grouped into
        chapters having a lay prior and subprior or prioress and subprioress and hold monthly meetings Since the Rule of
        Muon de Zamora 1285 they have always been subject to a Dominican priest appointed by the Dominican provincial
        For the actual reception of the habit the mastergeneral can give faculties to any priest The full habit is the
        same as that of the members of the First and Second Orders but without the scapular granted however to
        communities since 1667 Though the habit is not worn during life many procure it so that they may be buried in
        the recognized dress of St Dominics children

        It is practically impossible to obtain even in a vague way the number of the secular Dominican Tertiaries No
        general register is kept and the records of each priory would have to be searched From the time of St Louis who
        wished to join the Dominican and Franciscan Orders Acta Sanctorum August V 545 and is represented in old
        illuminations sometimes in the habit of one sometimes in the habit of the other Chapotin Histoire de dominicains
        de la province de France Rouen 1898 p497 but probably never joined either to our own time it can be stated only
        that with the rise and fall of the First Orders greatness rose and fell the number of the Tertiaries In England
        during the 13th century very many are said to have become Tertiaries But of this nothing for certain can be
        specified

        At the time of St Catherine of Siena the Mantellate women secular Tertiaries made difficulties about receiving
        her to the habit as they included at the date only widows Gardner St Catherine of Siena London 1907 II and there
        were no men at all in the Third Order in Italy at that date Acta Sanctorum April III 1881 Under Bl Raymond of
        Capua her confessor and after her death twentythird master general attempts were made to reestablish the order
        and no doubt much was done Mortier Matres gnraux III 605606 But by the time of St Antoninus died 1450 the
        numbers had again dwindled down to insignificance Summa Moralis Verona 1750 III 23 5 5 pp12912 Just previous to
        the Reformation there are a few isolated notices thus Bl Adrian Fortescue the martyr notes in his diary Given to
        the Black Friars of Oxford to be in their fraternity 12d Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII London
        1883 Rolls Series VII 101 But these give us no ground at all for any surmise as to statistics In the Americas
        the first canonized saint St Rose of Lima died 1617 and the first beatified person of mixedrace St Martin de
        Porres died 1639 were both Dominican Tertiaries and later in France were men like M Olier and St Louis de
        Montfort

        In the United States Lay Dominican Provinces include the Southern Province Central Province Western Province and
        Eastern Province

        Then came the influence of Lacordaire from whose time there dates a new enthusiasm in the Third Order Anne
        Dominicaine Paris 1910 14965 Of the regular Tertiaries it is easier to speak more definitely The numbers of all
        the sixteen approved congregations existing in 1902 are given and they amount to some 7000 nuns Analecta Ord
        Praed Rome 1902 389 To these must be added another 7000 of congregations not yet definitively authorized by Rome
        But many fresh convents were opened and the numbers continually increased In England they began under Mother
        Margaret Hallahan died 1868 in 1842 and now in all the separate groupings there are 22 convents with some 500
        sisters in the United States their success has been remarkable Founded in 1846 by Mother Amalie Barth died 1895
        the congregation in 1902 included 34 convents and over 2000 nuns In 1876 they passed into California where they
        are rapidly increasing In Ireland they have many establishments especially for educational purposes for their
        work is as varied as the needs of humanity require Some are enclosed others teach visit the sick nurse the
        lepers look after old people take care of penitent girls work among the poor in the slums etc As for the
        congregation of teaching men they have been greatly disorganized since their expulsion from France At present
        they comprise but a halfdozen colleges in Fribourg San Sebastian and South America and do not amount to more
        than 100 members in all Finally a citation from Fabers Blessed Sacrament 2nd ed p565 may be made Those who are
        conversant with indeed who find the strength and consolation of their lives in the Acts of the Saints well know
        that there is not a nook in the mystical Paradise of our heavenly spouse where the flowers grow thicker or smell
        more fragrantly than this order of multitudinous childlike saints Nowhere in the Church does the Incarnate Word
        show His delight at being with the children of men in more touching simplicity with more unearthly sweetness or
        more spouselike familiarity than in this the youngest family of S Dominic

        1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election
        Parliamentary elections were held in Ukraine on 27 March 1994 with a second round between 2 and 10 April 15
        political parties gained seats and the majority of deputies were independents However 112 seats were remained
        unfilled and a succession of byelections were required in July August November and December 1994 and more in
        December 1995 and April 1996 Three hundred 300 seats or two thirds 23 of the parliament were required to be
        filled for the next convocation

        In what were the first elections held after Ukraine broke away from the Soviet Union the Communist Party of
        Ukraine emerged as the largest party in the Verkhovna Rada winning 86 of the 338 seats decided in the first two
        rounds This election was the result of a compromise between the President and the Verkhovna Rada which was
        reached on 24 September 1993 because of a political crisis caused by mass protests and strikes particularly from
        students and miners On that day the Rada adopted a decree to organize parliamentary elections ahead of schedule
        and ahead of scheduled presidential elections in June

        As in the previous this election took place according to the majoritarian electoral system in 450 electoral
        districts containing several precincts Each region was assigned a proportion of districts depending on its
        population Hence the most mandates were received by the more populated eastern regions of Ukraine particularly
        the regions of Donets basin such as Donetsk Oblast and Dnipropetrovsk Oblast

        In order to be elected a candidate needed to obtain more than 50 of votes and in order for the election to be
        valid more than 50 of registered voters needed to vote If no candidate obtained more than 50 in the first round
        the top two candidates were listed on the ballot in the second round In the second round the 50 rule was applied
        as well Reelections were called in case if the 50 votes in the second round was not met

        Because of those conditions several districts in the Verkhovna Rada were left not represented for a whole
        convocation Particularly acute that problem was in the city of Kiev that was assigned 23 mandates while in the
        parliament only its 10 representatives participated in the second convocation less than a half Kiev became the
        most under represented region

        Blocs were formed in the Rada on 11 May 1994

        The political blocks formed in the Verkhovna Rada did not exactly represented a similar party Such parties as
        the Peasants Party of Ukraine SelPU and the Agrarians for Reform AZR a breakaway SelPU members formed the
        Agrarians of Ukraine block Although some of the deputies especially from SelPU joined the Socialist block The
        Ukrainian Republican Party URP the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists CUN and the Democratic Party of Ukraine
        DemPU has formed the electoral block Derzhavnist Statehood


        In February 1997 the following factions were present in parliament


        Due to the low turnout 112 seats remained vacant and later in the summer of 1994 24 and 31 July and 7 August 20
        MPs were elected to the Rada On 20 November and 4 December nine more MPs were elected

        On 30 May 1994 MP Roman Kuper died of a heart attack and Leonid Kravchuk was elected as his replacement on 25
        September On 15 July Leonid Kuchma surrendered his parliamentarian mandate after being elected President and
        Vasyl Yevrukhov was elected in his place On 21 August MP Vitaliy Yurkovsky died and was replaced by Natalya
        Vitrenko

        Domenico Colombo
        Domenico Colombo English Dominic Columbus Genoese Domenego Corombo 14181496 was the father of navigator
        Christopher Columbus and Bartholomew Columbus He was also a middleclass weaver

        There is speculation that the city of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola which his son Christopher first
        settled upon when reaching the New World was named after him Although others argue Bartholomew undecided about
        the name saw in the calendar that August 8 was dedicated to Santo Domingo de Guzman as so he called it

        Domenico was born in 1418 He had three brothers who were called Franceschino Giacomo and Bertino

        His father Giovanni Colombo had apprenticed him to the loom at age 11 Domenico a thirdgeneration master of his
        craft in Genoa was also a shopkeeper His position was secure and respectable in the lower middle class but he
        did not have a firm work ethic He was a poor provider but was generally liked in his community

        In the boisterous enterprising spirit of Genoa he worked as a cheese maker tavern keeper and dealer in wool and
        wine He married Susanna Fontanarossa Their firstborn was Christopher in 1451 Giovanni Pellegrino Bartholomew
        Giacomo and daughter Bianchinetta were born after

        When he was found in financial difficulty he was helped economically by Christopher Forsaking the loom two of
        his sons Bartholomew and Christopher went to the sea If Domenico had however been prosperous Christopher might
        have spent his entire life at a loom

        Domenicos daughterinlaw was Filipa Moniz Perestrelo and his grandsons were Diego Columbus and Ferdinand Columbus
        He also had one natural granddaughter Maria

        As of 2007 CELF had the following technical working groups

        These working groups collect improvements to Linux and Linuxrelated software from CELF members and help members
        coordinate on projects to enhance Linux in their respective technical areas

        The forum encourages its members to submit technical output directly back to the relevant open source project
        for example by sending enhancements to the Linux kernel directly to the Linux kernel mailing list or to an
        appropriate technology or architecturespecific mailing list Collected information and forum output is primarily
        located on the forums wiki for embedded developers

        The CE Linux Forum also has sponsorships to bring embedded projects to fruition Thanks to grants from CELF
        amongst others the LinuxTiny patches and the LogFS and SquashFS flash file systems have been pushed to mainline
        Linux

        CELF hosts the eLinuxorg wiki a wiki dedicated to Embedded Linux

        The forum has been the driving force behind the Embedded Linux Conference since 2005 Originally started as a
        conference in the US in spring there now also is a yearly ELC Europe in the Autumn time frame Both conferences
        are very developerfocused and usually attract 150200 Linux engineers ELC is an Englishlanguage conference with
        several parallel tracks and lasts 2 or 3 days The European conference has always been cohosted in 2007 it was
        hosted with the Realtime Linux Workshop in Linz Austria in 2008 with the NLUUG in Ede Netherlands and in 2009
        with Embedded Systems Week in Grenoble The 2009 and 2010 spring conferences in the Americas were coorganized
        with the Linux Foundation

        CELF sponsored the Linux Symposium from 2004 to 2008 hosting BoFs and sessions specific to embedded use of Linux
        and development of Linux capabilities for embedded use

        In Japan and Korea CELF organizes Technical Jamborees every two months Jamborees are smaller have a single track
        and are held in the local language

        Spalliera
        A spalliera Plural spalliere is a decorated backboard mounted on a wall often behind a cassone a wooden chest
        used for storage or as a headboard to a bed It is usually made out of wood and embellished with decorative
        aspects such as intricate carving or painting and is gilded as well They were common in Renaissance Tuscany

        No examples of Florentine sets of spalliere with inset paintings have survived intact At the most expensive
        level all four walls of a room seem to have had panels fitted which were richly decorated with carved wood
        marquetry and sometimes paintings inset into the wood These paintings were usually much wider than tall like the
        painted panels on cassoni They seem often to have been made to celebrate a wedding and fitted to the marital
        bedroom though other important rooms also had them

        Sandro Botticelli and Piero di Cosimo are two of the better known painters who produced many paintings whose
        wide format suggests that this was their original function they have now been given conventional picture frames

        Vernon Howe Bailey
        Vernon Howe Bailey 1874October 27 1953 was an American artist After undertaking art studies he was a staff
        member at The Philadelphia Times and the Boston Herald He also contributed to publications including Scribners
        and Harpers

        Bailey was born in Camden New Jersey At the age of 15 Bailey became a student at the Pennsylvania Museum School
        of Art in Philadelphia A year later one of his drawings of flowers was accepted for the annual exhibition of the
        Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts where he later studied In addition to these schools he also had the chance to
        study at Royal College of Art London Academie de lecluse and Acadmie Bilouil Paris France Deciding that he
        wanted to see great events and make pictures of them he joined the art staff of The Philadelphia Times in 1892
        and two years later went to The Boston Herald He found plenty of action for his pencil in the life of the
        citycrime court trials fires and shipwrecksand in the political conventions of 1900

        From 18921901 he was a staff artist on the Philadelphia Times and the Boston Herald to later contribute to
        Scribners Harpers The Century Everybodys and other leading The Harpers Weekly Leslies Weekly and Colliers
        Throughout this experience he had to travel extensively In 1902 he represented the Boston Herald as special
        artist at the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in London Then in 1907 he visited Paris London
        Italy and Germany as a special staff artist for Harpers Magazine Upon the entry of the United States into World
        War I in 1917 Bailey was the first artist authorized to make drawings of navy yards gun shops and munition
        plants The drawings that he did were later published and exhibited in art museums widely and won Bailey the
        Official Thanks of Josephus Daniel the former Secretary of the Navy These drawings were later acquired by the
        Smithsonian Institution and a set of prints was installed in the French War Museum Paris

        After this expedition Bailey traveled extensively throughout Spain He completed his tour in 1921 after traveling
        cities and small towns all over the country capturing the landscapes and scenes in watercolors and drawings In
        1925 he did another Spanish tour and later this collection of 150 drawings was turned into a published book
        Little Known Towns of Spain This book received a great amount of attention in addition to the royal decree of
        thanks from King Alphonso XIII of Spain Within the book was the following writeup

        At a meeting in Paris of Agnacio Zuloaga and Vernon Howe Bailey Senor Zuloga having highly complimented Mr
        Bailey on his work in Spain said But when I saw your book of watercolors and drawings of Spain I was angry with
        you for you have disclosed to the world the names of Spanish towns of which I hoped it would never learn for the
        tourists will spoil them and gone will be their true character and the life and the old costumes I have loved to
        paint will have vanished Within fifteen years Spain will have been spoiled for me

        Baileys special subject were city streets landscapes buildings and maritime scenes in Europe and America The
        best known of his drawings are his sketches in pencil of London his watercolor and drawings of Spain and his
        drawings of skyscrapers in New York City Bailey was the first artist privileged by the United States government
        on the declaration of war to make drawings of navy yards munition factories and other centres of war work as
        mentioned These drawings appeared in exhibitions and were published in the leading magazines throughout the
        country The collections he created in Spain were later bought by The Hispanic Society and were shown in the Muse
        de la Guerre of France contains a collection of lithographs of American war subjects Besides his work as a
        newspaper artist in London and America Bailey illustrated many books

        Once returning to the United States the series of lithograph studies of New York skyscrapers in 1927 that Bailey
        did were later exhibited in London under the patronage of the Dutchess of Rutland After exhibition in London the
        drawings were taken to the National Library and Museums in Madrid under the auspices of the Duke of Alba The
        exhibition was opened by King Alfonso XIII who issued him a Royal Decree of Thanks and he was elected a
        Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of Find Arts of San Fernando

        Another significant moment in Baileys life was the time when he had the chance to be the only artist permitted
        to produce a comprehensive collection of drawings of the Popes private apartments This project took Bailey a
        year and during this amazing experience he was able to choose whatever composition and subject he wanted He
        created over 100 watercolors and drawings Later the collection was exhibited in the American Art AssoAnderson
        Galleries in New York

        The 2006 Ladbrokescom World Darts Championship was the 13th World Championship organised by the Professional
        Darts Corporation PDC since it separated from the British Darts Organisation BDO It was held from 19 December
        2005 to 2 January 2006 at the Circus Tavern Purfleet Essex

        A record field of 64 finalists assembled to battle for Phil Taylors world crown Play was not held between 22
        December and Christmas Day due to the Christmas break Play resumed on Boxing Day in the leadup to the final A
        days break was also held on New Years Eve for the New Year Record prize money of 100000 for the winner was in
        offer

        Despite the record field there was a notable absentee John Lowes world ranking had fallen to a level which meant
        he was forced to qualify for the event which he failed to do for the first time in his career His run of 28
        successive appearances including the BDO World Championship had come to an end He was the last player to have
        appeared in a world championship each year since it began in 1978 Bob Anderson who made his debut in 1984 now
        had the longest unbroken run making his 23rd consecutive appearance for these championships

        A major shock came in the first round when world number one and top seed Colin Lloyd lost to Gary Welding it was
        only the second time in the history of the PDC World Championship that the top seed fell in the first round
        Peter Manley being the first in 2001 Welding who had recovered from two sets down in his bestoffivesets match
        against Lloyd went on to reach the quarterfinals

        Phil Taylor became World Champion for the 13th time this being his 11th PDC success His toughest battle en route
        to the championship was a tight semifinal against Wayne Mardle which he managed to win by 6 sets to 5 The final
        was a more onesided affair as Taylor overcame Peter Manley 70 It was Manleys third final defeat against Taylor
        and the second time he was whitewashed mirroring the result of the 2002 final

        Mesosphere mantle
        In geology the mesosphere refers to the part of the Earths mantle below the lithosphere and the asthenosphere
        but above the outer core The upper boundary is defined by the sharp increase in seismic wave velocities and
        density at a depth of At a depth of 660km ringwoodite gammaMgFeSiO decomposes into MgSi perovskite and
        magnesiowstite This reaction marks the boundary between upper mantle and lower mantle This measurement is
        estimated from seismic data and highpressure laboratory experiments

        The base of the mesosphere includes the D zone which lies just above the coremantle boundary at approximately
        The base of the lower mantle is at about 2700km

        Mesosphere not to be confused with mesosphere a layer of the atmosphere is derived from mesospheric shell coined
        by Reginald Aldworth Daly a Harvard University geology professor In the preplate tectonics era Daly 1940
        inferred that the outer Earth consisted of three spherical layers lithosphere including the crust asthenosphere
        and mesospheric shell Dalys hypothetical depths to the lithosphereasthenosphere boundary ranged from and the top
        of the mesospheric shell base of the asthenosphere were from Thus Dalys asthenosphere was inferred to be thick
        According to Daly the base of the solid Earth mesosphere could extend to the base of the mantle and thus to the
        top of the core The term mesosphere has largely been replaced by the term lower mantle in the scientific
        literature

        A derivative term mesoplates was introduced as a heuristic based on a combination of mesosphere and plate for
        postulated reference frames in which mantle hotspots apparently exist

        Denver Seminary
        Denver Seminary is an accredited graduatelevel institution based in Littleton Colorado with extension campuses
        in Washington DC and West Texas It offers Master of Arts Master of Divinity Doctor of Ministry and Master of
        Theology degrees with numerous specialized concentrations and has enrollment of about 900 students It is known
        for its emphasis on training and mentoring as an integral aspect to seminary education Denver Seminary adheres
        to the National Association of Evangelicals Statement of Faith

        The evangelical theological stance of Denver Seminary is captured by the words of the late chancellor Vernon
        Grounds

        Here is no unanchored liberalism freedom to think without commitment Here is no encrusted dogmatism commitment
        without freedom to think Here is a vibrant evangelicalism commitment with freedom to think within the limits
        laid down in Scripture

        This statement was first used by Grounds to stake out Denver Seminarys theological position in the midst of
        conflict between moderately conservative and ultraconservative factions of the Conservative Baptist Association
        that eventually led the ultraconservative faction to withdraw from the CBA and found the Conservative Baptist
        Fellowship CBF Grounds formerly the academic dean of fundamentalist Baptist seminary in New York state
        affiliated with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches eventually became a key spokesperson for the
        evangelical movement that attributes its roots to the writings of Carl F H Henry Under his leadership Denver
        Seminary became firmly rooted in this theological camp

        Today Denver Seminary is a nondenominational evangelical seminary that still holds to this statement by
        chancellor Vernon Grounds

        Denver Seminary was founded in 1950 by members of the newly founded Conservative Baptist Association This is a
        group of churches that separated from the Northern Baptist Convention over theological differences stemming from
        the FundamentalistModernist Controversy conflict earlier in the twentieth century The school was originally
        known as the Conservative Baptist Theological Seminary and in 1982 changed its name to Denver Conservative
        Baptist Seminary The school changed its name again in 1998 to Denver Seminary to reflect its growing appeal to a
        widespectrum of evangelical students Students are required to sign the statement of faith used by the National
        Association of Evangelicals

        Dr Carey Thomas became the Seminarys first president in 1950 In 1956 Dr Vernon Grounds was appointed as the
        second president and remained so until 1979 During his tenure Vernon Grounds was responsible for initiating
        directing and managing the Seminarys extensive growth and progress In June 1962 Denver Seminary was granted
        associate membership in the American Association of Theological Schools now the Association of Theological
        Schools Full accreditation was achieved in the Association of Theological Schools in 1971 and in the North
        Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1972 Fortyone years after Denver Seminarys inception
        1991 the student body numbered over five hundred students who came from forty states fiftythree denominations
        and fifteen countries

        In 1996 Dr Clyde McDowell the fifth president pioneered the groundbreaking effort behind becoming the first
        seminary ever to receive accreditation by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education
        Programs CACREP for its counseling degree program Additionally Dr McDowell reinvented the schools approach to
        seminary education by incorporating an intensive contextualized mentoring experience into its core curriculuma
        program of training and mentoring for which Denver Seminary has become well known

        In 2005 under the leadership of President Craig Williford Denver Seminary moved from the Englewood Colorado
        location to a new campus in Littleton Colorado where the school currently resides Built from the ground up
        specifically for the Seminary the campus features an academicleadership training center a learning resource
        center home to the library and student center an administrative building which includes the Shepherds Gate
        Counseling Center and nearly 100 student apartments The campus is situated next to the historic South Platte
        River with views of the Rocky Mountains and access to running and biking trails along the river

        In 2002 Senior Professor of Church History Bruce Shelley authored a biography on Grounds titled Transformed by
        LoveThe Vernon Grounds Story This book gives a comprehensive overview of Denver Seminarys history as it
        developed from a small denominational school to a major evangelical seminary under Grounds leadership

        Richard Asher
        Richard Alan John Asher FRCP 3 April 1912 25 April 1969 was an eminent British endocrinologist and haematologist
        As the senior physician responsible for the mental observation ward at the Central Middlesex Hospital he
        described and named Munchausen syndrome in a 1951 article in The Lancet

        Richard Asher was born to the Reverend Felix Asher and his wife Louise ne Stern He married Margaret Augusta
        Eliot at St Pancras Church London on 27 July 1943 whereupon his fatherinlaw gave him a complete set of the
        Oxford English Dictionary which doctor and medical ethicist Maurice Pappworth alleged was the source of Ashers
        accidental reputation as a medical etymologist They had three children Peter Asher born 1944 a member of the pop
        duo Peter Gordon and later record producer Jane Asher born 1946 a film and TV actress and novelist and Clare
        Asher born 1948 a radio actress

        The Asher family home above his private consulting rooms at 57 Wimpole Street was briefly notable when Paul
        McCartney lived there in 196466 during his relationship with Jane Asher

        In 1964 Asher suddenly gave up his hospital post and perhaps all medical activities He suffered from depression
        in later life and reportedly died by his own hand at the age of 57

        Asher was regarded as one of the foremost medical thinkers of our times who emphasised the need to be
        increasingly critical of our own and other peoples thinking Asher was particularly concerned that many clinical
        notions are accepted because they are comforting rather than because there is any evidence to support them

        Asher was hailed as a pioneer in challenging the value of excessive bed rest following treatment and argued that
        the PelEbstein fever a fever characteristic for Hodgkins disease was an example of a condition that exists only
        because it has a name Ashers 1949 paper Myxoedematous Madness alerted a generation of physicians to the
        interaction between the brain and the thyroid gland As a result young and elderly psychiatric patients are now
        screened for thyroid malfunction Some of the madness cases are now thought to be the early descriptions of
        Hashimotos encephalopathy a rare neuroendocrine syndrome sometimes presenting with psychosis

        Asher is remembered today mostly for his refreshingly provoking articles which sparkle with sequinshis own
        aphorisms imaginary dialogue fantasies quotations He thought that medical writing should provide useful
        understandable and practical knowledge instead of allotovwords2obscure4any12succidinunderstandingthem
        Anthologies of his articles were wellreceived with the Talking Sense collection being described as still the
        best advice on medical writing Notable articles include

        The Seven Sins of Medicine is a lecture delivered by Asher and later published in The Lancet describing medical
        professional behaviour that is considered inappropriate These sins are often quoted to students

        From 19952010 an annual prize 2010 value 1200 in memory of Asher was awarded by the Royal Society of Medicine
        and the Society of Authors for the best first edition textbook aimed at undergraduate students The most recent
        prize was presented to Hugo Farne Edward NorrisCervetto and James WarbrickSmith for their book Oxford Cases in
        Medicine and Surgery at the Royal Society of Medicine 27 October 2010

    <doc id="7732659" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7732659" title="Nested quotation">
        Nested quotation
        A nested quotation is a quotation that is encapsulated inside another quotation forming a hierarchy with
        multiple levels When focusing on a certain quotation one must interpret it within its scope Nested quotation can
        be used in literature as in nested narration speech and computer science as in metastatements that refer to
        other statements as strings Nested quotation can be very confusing until evaluated carefully and until each
        quotation level is put into perspective

        In languages that allow for nested quotes and use quotation mark punctuation to indicate direct speech
        hierarchical quotation sublevels are usually punctuated by alternating between primary quotation marks and
        secondary quotation marks For a comprehensive analysis of the major quotation mark systems employed in major
        writing systems see Quotation mark

        Nested quotes often become an issue using the eval keyword The eval function is a function that converts and
        interprets a string as actual JavaScript code and runs that code If that string is specified as a literal then
        the code must be written as a quote itself and escaped accordingly

        For example
        This code declares a variable a which is assigned the value 3 and a blank alert window is popped up to the user

        Suppose we had to make a quote inside the quoted interpreted code In JavaScript you can only have one unescaped
        quote sublevel which has to be the alternate of the toplevel quote If the 2ndlevel quote symbol is the same as
        the firstlevel symbol these quotes must be escaped For example
        Furthermore unlike in the literature example the thirdlevel nested quote must be escaped in order not to
        conflict with either the first or secondlevel quote delimiters This is true regardless of alternatingsymbol
        encapsulation Every level after the third level must be recursively escaped for all the levels of quotes in
        which it is contained This includes the escape character itself the backslash which is escaped by itself

        For every sublevel in which a backslash is contained it must be escaped for the level above it and then all the
        backslashes used to escape that backslash as well as the original backslash must be escaped and so on and so
        forth for every level that is ascended This is to avoid ambiguity and confusion in escaping

        Here are some examples that demonstrate some of the above principles
        Note that the number of backslashes increase from 0 to 1 to 3 to 7 to 15 indicating a 2n1 rule for successively
        nested symbols

        Marcinkus
        Marcinkus is a oneman play by American author Tom Flannery based on the life of Roman Catholic Archbishop Paul
        Marcinkus

        The play had its debut in WilkesBarre Pennsylvania in July 2006 at the Arts YOUniverse center for the applied
        and living arts The production was under the direction of Paul Winarski and starred Greg Korin as the Archbishop
        After several revisions by the director and author the play was remounted in Scranton in February 2007 at the
        Old Brick Theatre It is a oneman dramatization of events in the life of Catholic Archbishop Paul Marcinkus whose
        shady tenure as head of the Vatican Bank included suspicions of money laundering Ponzi schemes and even
        assassination
        The original production while well receivedunderwent several script revisions by the author and director in
        order to streamline the piece The revised version which opened in Scranton ran 15 minutes shorter and is now
        considered the final version of the play

        A Las Vegas production of the play is also in the planning with original star Greg Korin

        The play takes place in a small office in what may be purgatory but looks very much like the archbishops office
        in Sun City Arizona his last residence as a retired man of the cloth
        Marcinkus relates directly to the audience stories from his youth growing up in Al Capones Chicago and how he
        eventually became a priest As the piece unfolds he tell his version of the Vatican Bank Scandal his appointment
        as head of the bank the death of Pope John Paul I and his job as bulldog to Pope John Paul II Although dramatic
        the piece is lightened by the humor that Flannery has instilled in his version of Marcinkus who was popularly
        quoted as saying You cant run the church on Hail Marys

        The niece of Archbishop Marcinkus afraid that the play would be a hatchet job on her uncle contacted playwright
        Flannery who sent her a copy of the text Not only did she agree that the play was a balanced look at her uncles
        life but even offered a few suggestions which the author included in his rewrite

    <doc id="7732687" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7732687" title="Sullivan principles">
        Sullivan principles
        The Sullivan principles are the names of two corporate codes of conduct developed by the AfricanAmerican
        preacher Rev Leon Sullivan promoting corporate social responsibility

        In 1977 Rev Leon Sullivan an AfricanAmerican minister was a member of the board of General Motors At the time
        General Motors was one of the largest corporations in the United States General Motors also happened to be the
        largest employer of blacks in South Africa a country which was pursuing a harsh program of statesanctioned
        racial segregation and discrimination targeted primarily at the countrys black population

        Sullivan looking back on his antiApartheid efforts recalled

        Starting with the work place I tightened the screws step by step and raised the bar step by step Eventually I
        got to the point where I said that companies must practice corporate civil disobedience against the laws and I
        threatened South Africa and said in two years Mandela must be freed apartheid must end and blacks must vote or
        else Ill bring every American company I can out of South Africa

        The Sullivan principles introduced in 1977 with one addition in 1984 consisted of seven requirements a
        corporation was to demand for its employees as a condition for doing business In general the principles demanded
        the equal treatment of employees regardless of their race both within and outside of the workplace demands which
        directly conflicted with the official South African policies of racial segregation and unequal rights

        The principles read
        The Sullivan principles were celebrated when introduced and gained wide use in the United States particularly
        during the disinvestment campaign of the 1980s Before the end of South Africas apartheid era the principles were
        formally adopted by more than 125 US corporations that had operations in South Africa Of those companies that
        formally adopted the principles at least 100 completely withdrew their existing operations from South Africa

        However as South Africas system of apartheid persisted relatively unchanged from the 1970s into the late 1980s
        Sullivan abandoned his principles as not going far enough complaining that the principles by themselves were not
        enough to pressure a South African government steadfast in its refusal to yield to change

        In 1999 more than 20 years after the adoption of the original Sullivan Principles and six years after the end of
        apartheid the Rev Leon Sullivan and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan together unveiled the new Global
        Sullivan Principles

        The overarching objective of these principles according to Leon Sullivan is to support economic social and
        political justice by companies where they do business including respect for human rights and equal work
        opportunities for all peoples

        In general the expanded corporate code of conduct requires adopting multinational companies to be a full
        participant in the advancement of human rights and social justice internationally

        The new principles read

        Gunnos is a rookie BDaPlayer who first appears in Season 2 episode 2 Despite being hotheaded sarcastic and
        limited experience he possesses amazing skill His first BDaman was a rapidfire BDaman named Gun Breaker which
        was a remake of Helio Breaker from Season 1He enters the Winners Tournament for his village as he promises them
        that when he left that he would go and win After encountering Yamato he tags along and becomes part of the
        regular rivalry between the two While he is rude and obnoxious to Yamato he is extremely polite towards others
        such as Terry Joe even bowing down to them because he thinks they are cool and smart and he saved a village from
        bandits using his new BDaman Break Ogre and his Strike Shot the Metal Shot He is in love with a girl named Kiko
        and dislikes the daughter of the highest man in their village

        Little is known about this boy He has said that he is the last survivor of a clan who knows the secret of a
        special BDaman move His BDaman was Revolver Hades He is befriended by Bull and slowly begins to accept him as a
        companion and friend Bull then vows to make Revolver Hades even better than Cobalt Saber Fire in order to help
        Akyulus win the tournament In the qualifying rounds of the 2nd Winners Tournament Akyulus is Division 2 and the
        contestants had to navigate through a series of difficult obstacles to shoot their BDaBall into the final hole a
        BDaman version of golf Akyulus is the first to finish using Revolver Hades special spin control abilities making
        him the first to qualify In the quarter finals the 10 contestants that made it through are regrouped into Set A
        and B Akyulus is grouped into Set A where the five contestants enter a pyramid to face three challenges They
        would have to hit a hovering blue ball to pass a challenge and that would transport them to a higher level and
        eventually out of the pyramid Akyulus and Enjyu are the victors of this challenge and they come out together so
        the first to emerge is unknown In the semifinals there are only four contestants left Yamato Gunnos Enjyu and
        Akyulas Enjyu and Akyulas face off in a game where they must defend their goal with their BDaman while
        attempting to shoot their own BDaBalls into the opponents goal Each player had to score ten goals before they
        would be declared the winner Akyulas easily defeats Enjyu but not before Enjyu finally uses all his strength to
        score one goal tarnishing Akyulas perfect 100 to 101 Akyulas is said to be a legendary battler from the spirits
        above In the Winners Tournament that he joined he battled last against Yamato And thanks to that battle he
        regained some of his memories his past And some of that past is bad He remembered that 100 years ago his village
        was destroyed by the evil side causing his peaceful village into complete chaos And as being a Legendary
        BDaPlayer he also has the power to create Strike Shots But when he does that he loses some of his energy Thanks
        to this ability he attracted the attention of Beadeus and was captured later forced to create the Ultimate
        Gadeaum shot Afterwards he was released into a dark underground dungeon where Yamato found him However due to
        the creation of the Gadeaum shot he lost his will and became an uncontrollable demonic fighter Also the Revolver
        Hades had been upgraded to Gatling Hades sometime during his capture and he used it to battle and nearly defeat
        Yamato However Yamato managed to rescue him by attacking and disabling Gatling Hades with the Stealth Drive Shot
        which was the proof of his and Yamatos friendship He later on decided to be with Yamato and the gang because
        Beadeus had already announced to the people of the whole BDaWorld that Yamatos side and Beadeuss side will fight
        In the beginning Yamato thought that the battle was too easy Until he found out that the evil sealed by Akyulass
        ancestors had been awakened because of the Ultimate Gadeaum Shot that Akyulas had made Galdezer has now been
        fully awakened Now because of the creatures escape he battled alongside Yamato to defeat Galdezer He befriends
        Yamato Terry Grey Gunnos and all the others later on Now in the final battle its up to Yamato to succeed Akyulas
        thought about Yamato and the Ultimate Gadeaum Shot He thought that the Strike Shot was so powerful so he thought
        he should make another Strike Shot that would defeat it Shin tried to warn him that when he created another
        Strike Shot it will cost him his life He said that he would never create a Strike Shot anymore and would live a
        happy and peaceful life with Yamato for the rest of their lives But when he sleeps he dreamed about Yamato being
        beaten by Galdezer He then decided to disobey Shin and create the Ultimate Drive Shot During the next day he
        didnt appear to support his newfound friend but when Yamato was almost beaten he then appeared and gave Yamato
        the Legend Drive Shot Shin now then knew that he had created another Strike Shot when he told Yamato to use it

        He is a talking wolf who travels with Akyulas seems to speak for Akyulas too Hes the one who first talked to
        Bull when they met He sometimes annoys Bull because Bull calls him a lot of names like spot doggie and a lot of
        other names Hes like the secretary and speaker of Akyulas Hes the one who explained to Yamato and the gang the
        past of Akyulas Ironically the last time Bull talked to him Bull finally called him Shin but he too reacted to
        the use of his own name as another insult coming from Bull

        He is a scorpionhaired BDaPlayer Obsessed with entering tournament he took the Random Shot from Terry and
        defeated Joe After losing in the Winners Tournament he also tried to sabotage the tournament but was stopped by
        Terry Haja eventually lost to Terry in the spider match Fortunately for him he was able to recover thanks to
        Beadeus and his servants His mission is supposed to be stopping Yamato and his friends from rescuing Akyulas but
        Haja disobeys his master He then destroys Beadeuss spy machines He later hires Jinbee to be his loyal servant
        Yamato and his friends were unsure of where he ended up to after he tried to stop him again He was absorbed by
        Galdezer so that he could have maximum power After Yamato defeated Galdezer he was released and promised to

        and after more than eight years in Detroit they were not on the air in 2008

        On November 29 2007 it was reported that their final show on WXYT would be on December 14 2007 as they look to
        find greener pastures During the December 2 2007 broadcast Deminski and Doyle did not implicitly confirm their

        decided to leave the station due to salary issues

        During the month of March 2010 the hosts had been periodically filling in with latenight shows on WPHT a
        conservativeleaning AM talk station out of Philadelphia Their shows on WPHT were void of nearly all comedic
        elements and were much more politically oriented but despite the leanings of the station their opinions remained
        mostly nonpartisan

        On June 24 2011 Deminski announced that starting July 5 2011 the pair would return to New Jersey 1015 WKXW for
        the afternoon drive show from 27 PM on weekdays

        related to internet topics and with relevant content and polls featured on NJ1015com The show relies heavily on
        interaction from callers Jeff Deminski describes his show as a radio version of the corner bar where guys will
        come in and BS with the two guys drinking beers at the end who would be Bill and me Thats kinda the philosophy
        weve always had Interviews are sometimes conducted with comedians authors and other individuals of interest to
        the hosts Almost all interviews during the history of the show are done live either instudio or via telephone

        Three seconds rule
        The three seconds rule also referred to as the threesecond rule or three in the key often termed a lane
        violation requires that in basketball a player shall not remain in the opponents restricted area for more than
        three consecutive seconds while that players team is in control of a live ball in the frontcourt and the game
        clock is running The countdown starts when one foot enters the restricted area and resets when both feet leave
        the area

        The threesecond rule was introduced in 1936 and was expressed as such no offensive player with or without the
        ball could remain in the key for three seconds or more

        The threesecond rule came about in part following a game at Madison Square Garden between the University of
        Kentucky UK and New York University NYU in 1935 won by NYU 2322 The University of Kentucky team did not take
        their own referee a common practice at the time despite advice to the UK coach Adolph Rupp from Notre Dame coach
        George Keogan who had lost to NYU the week prior and who warned Rupp of the discrepancies in officiating between
        the Midwest and the East The game was rough UK was unable to run its normal offense which consisted of using
        screens without being called for a foul NYUs Irving Terjesen and Irwin Klein combined to guard one of UKs major
        players Leroy Edwards allowing him to score a mere 6 points the lowest output of his career The New York Post
        reacted with alarm The score says that NYU is the best college basketball team in the country and that the East
        still is supreme But if Frank Lane the referee from the Midwest had worked the game its safe to assume big Leroy
        Edwards would have been given a fantastic number of foul shots Minor mayhem was committed on the person of
        Edwards by Terjesen and Klein Something will have to be done or the game will become entirely too rough

        Giovanni Paolo Maggini
        Giovanni Paolo Maggini c 1580 c 1630 was a luthier born in Botticino Brescia Italy Maggini was a pupil of the
        most important violin maker of the Brescian school Gasparo da Sal

        Magginis early instruments are now considered very desirable because despite their apparent naive craftsmanship
        they are wonderful instruments They first tended to be modified copies of his teachers instruments But once
        established on his own around the year 1606 Maggini developed his skills and experimented with his designs until
        he achieved a level of expertise that is still highly regarded His violas like these of his master are regarded
        as the best in the world for the rich deep sound and power of tone

        The only known pupil of Maggini is Valentino Siani who worked with him c 16101620 before he moved to Florence
        and started his own business

        Maggini succumbed to the Italian plague of 162931 that also took another important early luthier Girolamo Amati
        This fact arouses suspicions that some of Magginis later works are perhaps creations from a different maker
        since tests reveal that some instruments bearing a genuine Maggini label are from trees living after Magginis
        death

        The National Music Museum has two Maggini instruments in its collection One is a bass viola da gamba The other
        is a violin

        The 18thcentury European violin virtuosocomposer Ivan Mane Jarnovi played a Maggini violin

        A genuine Maggini violin ranges in value from 200000 to 2000000

        Ferrari F60
        The Ferrari F60 is a Formula One motor racing car which Scuderia Ferrari used to compete in the 2009 Formula One
        season The car was unveiled on 12 January 2009

        The F60 the 55th singleseater car produced by Ferrari to compete in Formula One was named F60 to celebrate the
        fact that 2009 is Ferraris 60th year in Formula One the only team to have competed every year It was first
        launched online on 12 January 2009 and Felipe Massa undertook the debut run of the car with a shakedown at
        Mugello later that day The car was initially intended to debut at Ferraris home Fiorano track but the venue was
        changed due to poor weather conditions at Maranello

        The F60s first full test took place at the Mugello Circuit during the week of 19 January 2009

        On average the Ferrari F60 is 19 seconds faster than the last car despite the new regulations In the 2009 season
        FIA banned the large bargeboards in front of the radiator and the sidepods It also placed limits on the
        wheelbase making it shorter simpler front splitter narrower rear spoiler and certain underside air flows so that
        it is less disruptive to the car behind The Ferrari F60 responded to all of this by improving tiny details from
        the F2008 The front splitter is located further away from the front wheel and now has only 1 layer Ferrari
        claims this improves air flow to the wheels The F60 is only fitted with 1tread slick tires and a simpler
        suspension positioned a bit backward in angle Ferrari removed the large airflow plates and replaced it with a
        small one also adjusting some underside air flow The side mirrors are located at the edge of the cars floor The
        FIAs ban on small side wings led to the creation of a cleaner sidepods acceptable of the smaller engine and a
        smooth underside of the chassis The rear diffuser is revised to meet the regulations that stated it has to
        produce less downforce

        The F60 scored its first points in Bahrain the fourth race of the season Kimi Rikknen finished sixth gaining

        Iceland competed in the Summer Olympic Games for the first time at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm Sweden
        Olympic historians treat Icelands results separate from those of Denmark despite Icelands lack of independence
        at the time

        A single athlete represented Iceland in athletics in the nations debut at the sport and the Olympics Halldrsson
        ran in the 100 metres finishing fourth in his first round heat and not advancing to the semifinals

        Ranks given are within that athletes heat for running events

        Icelands Olympic debut also included a wrestler Ptursson advanced to the fifth round of the light heavyweight
        competition on the strength of a 32 record making Iceland one of a very few countries to have a winning record
        in wrestling He did so despite facing four wrestlers from the dominant Finland team Ptursson remains the only
        wrestler to represent Iceland at the Olympics
