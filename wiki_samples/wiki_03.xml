Royal Albert Hall Organ
The Grand Organ situated in the Royal Albert Hall in London is the second largest pipe organ in the United Kingdom It was originally built by Henry Father Willis and most recently rebuilt by Mander Organs having 147 stops and 9997 speaking pipes

The original organ was built by Henry Willis  Sons in 1871 It had four manuals and 111 stops and was at that time the largest in the world

The Durham firm of Harrison  Harrison rebuilt the organ in two stages in 1924 and 1933 during which it was increased to 146 stops including three percussion stops and converted to electropneumatic action It was still the largest organ in Britain at that time The 2014 Pink Floyd album The Endless River includes a track Autumn 68 featuring a recording of band member Richard Wright playing the organ in 1969

In the 1970s Harrisons refurbished the console and replaced the switchgear in the action made minor changes to the voicing and added a roof to attempt to project the sound forward which was not successful One interesting note in this period is that composer Wendy Carlos featured the organ during the closing title sequence of the 1982 Disney science fiction film Tron performed by organist Martin Neary

By the end of the 20th century the organ was again in a state of disrepair with an everincreasing number of stops unusable due to leaks in the wind system cracks in the soundboards and other problems By 2002 it was maintained only through heroic efforts on the part of Harrisons and could not be used at all without their staff present in case of mishap The wind chests and pipes were leaking noisily and wind pressure was insufficient to support full use The leatherwork in the actions was also failing

In 2002 the organ was taken out of commission for an extensive rebuild by Mander Organs Some consideration was given to restoring the organ to its original Willis specification but the subsequent alterations and enlargements had made this impractical The organ was by now in truth a Harrison not a Willis instrument and it was felt that it should remain essentially asis

The dryness of the Hall had damaged the soundboards so these were replaced and new and larger wind trunks provided The roof was removed and the reed stops in the Great division were restored to their 1924 wind pressures The 1970s split of the Great Organ allowing two independent Great Organs to be registered and played simultaneously on different manuals was rationalised effectively offering separate Willis and Harrison choruses also a FournitureIV was added bringing the total to 147 stops and 9997 speaking pipes For a few years the organ was once again the largest in the UK until in 2007 the distinction passed to the organ in Liverpool Anglican Cathedral 10268 pipes

The organ was reopened at a gala concert on the evening of 26 June 2004 with David Briggs John Scott and Thomas Trotter playing with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Richard Hickox The organ featured prominently in the 2004 BBC Proms series The first recordings on the newly rebuilt instrument were by Dame Gillian Weir The instrument has also been used by progressive rock band Muse when playing Megalomania originally recorded on another Willis organ at the church of Saint Mary in Bathwick During a live performance at the Royal Albert Hall on the 12 April 2008 Muses frontman Matt Bellamy had commented that since were here it would be rude not to play this beast

There are three public elementary schools in the area Forest Glade Public School Parkview Public School and Eastwood Public School In addition to these there are two Catholic school board schools LA Desmarais and HJ Lassaline

Housing in Forest Glade generally consists of freestanding single family homes owned as opposed to rented There are a number of apartment buildings but the majority of the population of the area live in houses Numerous churches and religious places are present in the community A shopping plaza or small strip mall is located near the Community Centre

Although Forest Glade or simply The Glade is an official part of the City of Windsor many residents show a sense of patriotism that would suggest it were an independent town

Forest Glade is well known amongst Windsorites for having many winding and confusing roads It is very easy to get lost in Forest Glade as there are lots of crescents and some of the streets even intersect themselves Numerous crescenttype streets are renamed halfway along them making navigation for people unfamiliar with the area difficult at best

The community is an example of a planned community as until the late 1960s the area was mainly farmland with fewer than a dozen houses in the area The community was built in stages throughout the 1960s 1970s and 1980s with most of the available land between the road boundaries being used The most recent expansion is in the North East corner constructing new houses near Banwell Road

Alfred Taylor Howard
Alfred Taylor Howard born 12 March 1868 was a Bishop of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ elected in 1913

Alfred was born in the rural community of Pleasant Valley Prairie Ronde Township near the town of Schoolcraft Kalamazoo County Michigan His is the story of a farm boy who responded to the call of the far horizon to become a world citizen and a Christian witness to the uttermost part of the earth

The Pleasant Valley neighborhood though a tiny dot on the map was in fact singularly cosmopolitan Early settlers had come from many eastern States and some directly from England the Netherlands and Germany This diversity may have placed in this boys mind the idea of the bigness of the world

Alfred was the son of Cornelius Howard who was born in Michigan in 1841 His mother was Harriett Guilford Alfreds paternal grandfather was of English lineage arriving in Michigan from White Plains New York His paternal grandmother was Margaret Osterhut of Dutch descent

Cornelius was deeply involved and powerfully loyal to the Church of the United Brethren in Christ He was a frequent lay member to the St Joseph Annual Conference twice to the General Conference and served for ten years as a Trustee of Otterbein College Harriett Howard was likewise devoted if unobtrusive in her religious expression As a boy Alfred was uplifted by the sound of his mothers voice raised in prayer as she went about her housework

Alfreds favorite reading in boyhood was the Youths Companion a weekly magazine for young people filled with hairraising tales of Indian fights on the frontier As a man Alfred expressed regret that those exciting stories always assumed the Indians had no rights on the land where they were reared and on which their ancestors had lived for generations

Alfred attended country school then the Schoolcraft High School four miles from his home His favorite high school subject was physical geography He also enjoyed physiology which prompted in him for many years the desire to study medicine At the age of eighteen he taught school one year in his neighborhood The next year he taught near Davenport Nebraska

Young Alfred was often encouraged to attend college One of his encouragers was his pastor the Rev J L Parks Thus it was decided that Alfred should attend Roanoke Classical Seminary in Indiana The Principal was Professor D N Howe a graduate of Otterbein and of the Union Biblical Seminary in Dayton Ohio now United Theological Seminary Alfred enjoyed these college preparatory studies under Professor Howe After this one year however because the Roanoke Seminary moved to North Manchester Indiana Alfred decided to attend Otterbein in Westerville Ohio

The autumn of 1889 found Alfred Howard at the age of twentyone enrolled in the academy of Otterbein College One year later he matriculated to the college itself His days at Otterbein were happy ones and he never tired in later years of relating his college memories Alfred was an earnest student with a mind thirsty for truth a characteristic he retained the rest of his life Nevertheless bad eyesight severely handicapped him and he had great difficulty getting glasses which fit properly

Heredity and an active farm upbringing gave Alfred a powerful physique In college he played varsity football alternating between center and guard Frequently he was pivot man in the famous flying wedge

Alfred sang first tenor in the Otterbein Quartet the first of a series of such organizations in the history of the college On one occasion the quartet sang at the church of W W Williamson who had a son John The latter was fascinated by the singing collegians and vowed to also some day go to Otterbein and sing in the quartet In due time John Finley Williamson did both and much more than that He continued his musical interests after graduation organizing a choir and a choir school founding the Westminster Choir College in Dayton Ohio presently in Princeton New Jersey which became world famous

One year Alfred directed the Presbyterian Church choir in Marion Ohio traveling from Otterbein each weekend The pastor was a Rev Mr Thomas whose young son Norman became well acquainted with Alfred Later Norman Thomas also became a Presbyterian minister but is better known as the frequent candidate for President of the United States on the Socialist ticket

The Young Mens Christian Association on the Otterbein campus made a rich contribution to Alfred Howards life S D Gordon was state secretary of college YMCA work in Ohio at that time and John R Mott and Robert E Speer young men just out of Cornell and Princeton respectively were frequent speakers at YMCA conferences

In 1890 at one such conference John R Mott made an address which engraved three unforgotten sentences on young Howards mind
One summer Alfred even attended the famous college YMCA conference at Northfield Massachusetts

Howard met May Day Stevenson at Otterbein They conducted their courtship on the campus but he proposed to her one summer by letter

Alfred and May were married on their graduation day 15 June 1894 in the home of Professor Henry Garst who performed the ceremony in the presence of many college friends Soon thereafter the happy couple were on the high seas sailing for the mission field in Africa

Alfred Taylor Howard was deeply religious He believed profoundly in the efficacy of prayer As a boy he had formed the habit of prayer and as a college student prayed regularly In later life while taking long walks he would pray for long lists of persons and causes setting aside certain days of the week for various portions of his long prayer lists

Toward the end of his college days Alfred wondered about what his lifework should be So he made this a matter for prayer During the summer before his senior year while working on his fathers farm he chose a certain empty stall in the barn as his quiet place for daily intercession Later he wrote I do not know when in my life I ever prayed more earnestly for definite guidance

In his handwritten memoirs found after his death he tells of the outcome of his prayer

Lyonclass battleship
The Lyon class was a proposed battleship class which was planned for the French Navy in 1913 with construction scheduled to begin in 1915 The class was to have comprised four ships Lyon Lille Duquesne and Tourville The first two were named for cities in France while the rest honored French admirals Abraham Duquesne and Anne Hilarion de Tourville The design was an improvement on the previous  and mounted a fourth quadruplegun turret for a total of sixteen guns Construction was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 before any of the ships could be laid down

Starting in 1910 the French Navy began a dreadnought battleship construction program starting with the four ships of the that year The threeship was authorized the next year and five s followed in 1912 Design work began in 1912 the design staff submitted several proposals for the new battleships Displacements ranged from to  the various designs featured a main battery of fourteen or sixteen guns eight or ten guns or twenty guns in a mix of quadruple or twin gun turrets

In 1913 the Navy authorized a fourth class of battleships Lyon which was scheduled for 1915 The design staff determined the 38cm gun would take too long to design so the proposals that incorporated these weapons were cancelled The design staff settled on one of the two 34cm proposals The first proposal which mounted fourteen guns was a ship long On 24 November 1913 the design staff instead chose the slightly larger second design armed with sixteen guns in four quadruple turrets The first two ships Lyon and Lille were scheduled to be ordered on 1 January 1915 and Duquesne and Tourville would have followed on 1 April 1915 World War I broke out in August 1914 however and shifting military requirements particularly for the army forced the cancellation of the class

Rhinophoridae is a family of flies Diptera found in all zoogeographic regions except Australasia and Oceania but mainly in the Palaearctic and Afrotropical regions

They are small slender black bristly flies phylogenetically close to the Tachinidae although some authors consider them a sister group of te Calliphoridae The larvae are mostly parasitoids of woodlice beetles spiders and other arthropods and occasionally snails

By 2014 about 23 genera were placed in the family with a total of about 150 species More are being described occasionally

Dharpa
Dharpa aka Dharpa Chuharpur is a village in Khurja Tehsil in Bulandshahr District of Uttar Pradesh in northern India It is situated on the Grand Trunk Road between Bulandshahr and Khurja This village is 14km away from Bulandshahr SouthEast and 5km away from Khurja NorthWest

The village is one of the 5 Tomar Rajput villages of Tomar Tanwar Rajputs The other Rajput clans in this village are Jadaun or Jadon along with one Chauhan family People of various other castes along with few Muslim families also live in the village

There are 3 government schools
1 Primary School
2 Grirls Junior High School
3 Janta Vidyalaya High School  Dharpa Achchheja
For higher studies after high school the students need to go to Khurja where there are 3 main Inter Colleges along with a degree colleague under Chaudhary Charan Singh University aka Meerut University Recently village students have also got other options of private or public schools in Khurja and nearby places It is very unfortunate and sad that there are not many students who are academically doing good in the village This is because of the deteriorating condition of state government schools

The import thing is that the villagers put a lot of importance on the education of girls which is a very good sign for the whole society It has been noticed in the recent past that sometimes girls academic performance is better than boys and a number of girls are pursuing higher education A fact worth mentioning is that few families have moved to nearby town just for their daughters higher education as there is no degree college in the vicinity

There is One BAMS College has opened in this village and people come from outside to complete their study Which is very good news about the village and its peopleIt is about to open a degree college in this village very soon

There is a Language School is about to open where students of this village and around could take the advantage of this

The village has a post office The PIN code of this village is 203131

The village comes under KhurjaDehat Rural police station which is situated just 2km away toward SouthWest from village across GT Road The good thing is that the village has notices less crime The village people live in peace and harmony except few very small rare cases of crime or violence

In the recent past a number of shops have opened by villagers on the road which has emerged as a market No villagers get all the household items from these shops There are various shops on the road market such tailor salons confectionery medical stores grocery and stationery puncture fixing cyclescootermotor cycle repairing STD booths carpenter flour mill electronics gadgets repairing etc This small market also serves the needs of other nearby villages

The main source of income for majority of people if agriculture The main crops are sugarcane wheat and paddy anlog with cash crops The water from canal is a main source of irrigation The well known Upper Ganga Canal passes through the village periphery There are couple of tube wells as well In case of shortage of canals water or electricity sometimes the farmers are compelled to use ground water pumped using diesel engines which becomes a very costly affair

The village low income population is also dependent on the industries around the village like potteries dairy and iron rods fabrication factory The figure of government employees in the village is not very encouraging There are few village people who have got employment in private sector

In the search of employment the village people migrate to nearby towns and New Delhi

Roseville Bridge
The Roseville Bridge a concrete box girder bridge located adjacent to the suburb of  crosses the Middle Harbour in Sydney New South Wales Australia The bridge carries Warringah Road part of the A38 and is one of two crossings of Middle Harbour inclusive of the Spit Bridge 

The bridge is long has a clearance of from the water below However the adjacent Pipe Bridge has a clearance of only  This limitation combined with only depth of water make it out of reach for most cruising vessels

An original bridge across Middle Harbour at Roseville was built jointly by the Willoughby Kuringgai and Warringah councils It was built of reinforced concrete by unemployed returned servicemen and opened on 20 September 1924 It was claimed to be the longest bridge of that type in NSW although the bridge across the Hawkesbury River at was longer It was claimed to be the first bridge supported on reinforced concrete piles This lowlevel twolane bridge was located downstream of the current bridge and connected Babbage Road to what is today called Healey Way which is the entrance to Davidson Park within Garigal National Park The first bridge replaced an earlier ferry service consisting of rowing boats across the narrowest section of water

The suburbs east of Middle Harbour grew rapidly in the years following the opening of Roseville Bridge and on 2 April 1966 the Liberal Premier Robin Askin the Member for Collaroy at the time later the Member for Pittwater opened the current sixlane highlevel bridge Along with the bridge a significant upgrade of the approach roads was completed which became the sixlane Warringah Road This upgraded section of road is about long

The 1924 bridge survived the opening of the new bridge and provided pedestrian access only until it was demolished in 1974 along with Roseville Baths Almost nothing remains from these structures

Today Roseville Bridge is part of a major thoroughfare from the Pacific Highway at Roseville to the Northern Beaches and suburbs east of Middle Harbour Due to the halt of the construction of the Warringah Expressway across Middle Harbour to Wakehurst Parkway and the Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation which is the only part of the Warringah Expressway built on the Northern Beaches by the Labor Wran government there are today only two other major roads to these areas Mona Vale Road and Spit Road which crosses Middle Harbour downstream from Roseville Bridge using the Spit Bridge

<doc id="7712308" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712308" title="Parnassius">
Parnassius
Parnassius is a genus of northern circumpolar and montane alpine and Himalayan butterflies usually known as Apollos or snow Apollos They can vary in colour and form significantly based on their altitude They also show an adaptation to high altitudes called altitudinal melanism They show dark bodies and darkened colouration at the wingbase which helps them warm faster using the sun

Although classified under the swallowtail butterfly family none of the Parnassius species possesses tails

The larvae feed on species of plants belonging to the Papaveraceae and Crassulaceae families and like the other swallowtail butterfly larvae possess an osmeterium Unlike most butterflies that have exposed pupae they pupate inside a loose silken cocoon

Parnassius species of butterflies are often hard to identify and can sometimes only be identified by dissection of the genitalia
The phylogeny of the group is still under study using molecular techniques The exact number of species within the genus is disputed and numbers range from 38 to 47

The Parnassius butterflies also have a peculiar reproductive strategy in that the male has special accessory glands that produce a mating plug that seals the female genitalia after mating This is believed to ensure the success of the male and to prevent other males from mating and avoids sperm competition

Butterflies of this genus have been widely used models to study metapopulations population genetics and gene flow Their patchy distribution and restricted migration makes them vulnerable to the effects of genetic drift and considerable colour variations can exist in individuals from different regions

Species include

Eight subgenera are recognized within the genus
Other names that are no longer valid include

A molecular phylogenetic study from 2008 suggests firstly that Baronia brevicornis Salvin 1893 rather than belonging to an outgroup Baroniinae belongs to Parnassiini together with Hypermnestra and Parnassius Secondly that the earliest split within the genus Parnassius is between subgenus Parnassius the apollo group whose caterpillars feed on Crassulaceae exceptionally Saxifragaceae and the ancestor of the remaining seven subgenera The existence of the subgenera is confirmed by molecular phylogenies Six of the other subgenera have Fumariaceae as the larval food plant while the larvae of the remaining genus Kreizbergia feed on Scrophulariaceae

Chappel
Chappel is a village and civil parish in the borough of Colchester Essex which sits on the River Colne It is significant for its Victorian viaduct which crosses the Colne valley

The present name of Chappel derives from the construction of a small chapel of ease noted in 1285AD as standing at the northern boundary of the parish of Great Tey During the 16th century because of concerns from Chappel residents about the distance to Great Teys own church at festival time this area was split from the parish and become a separate entity known as Pontisbright lit Britrics bridge that would eventually become known as Chappel

In 1433 the vicar of Great Tey agreed that the inhabitants of Chappel could find and elect their own chaplain The benefice itself was united with that of the neighbouring village of Wakes Colne in 1938 The chapel itself now the parish church of St Barnabas is a grade I listed building

The Chappel viaduct was built between 1847 and 1849 for the Colchester and Stour extension of the Eastern Counties Railway Originally planned to be a timber structure the viaduct was built of locally made brick because of the additional cost of maintaining a timber structure Approximately 600 men were involved in the construction most of whom were local East Anglians The cost of construction was approximately 21000 approximately 22 million in 2016 money

The viaduct consists of 32 arches of span with a total length of  and a maximum height of  The piers consist of two shafts separated by a opening and joined at top and bottom by arches each shaft contain a hollow void by maximum partially filled with concrete to the level of the bottom arch The running level of the viaduct has a gradient of 1 in 120

The viaduct became a listed monument in 1967 and is thought to be the secondlargest brickbuilt structure in England after Battersea Power Station

During the commemoration events to mark 50 years since the end of the Second World War Chappels beacon was transported by rail to a point on the viaduct where it could be seen from the playing field below and lit after a ceremonial silence the beginning and end of which were marked by the release of two maroons

Sywnthkrawft
Sywnthkrawft is a synth group from Borlnge Sweden They started playing in 2005 and have released 1 album 3 singles and 2 livealbums Their music have been described to sound like electronic spaceromance and ambient movie score music but theyve changed genre to more synth oriented music

Some artists that have inspired the music of Sywnthkrawft are Kraftwerk Depeche Mode and Ralph Lundsten

William Johansson Daniel Thyberg Gustav Jacobsson and Viktor Jacobsson created the band in the summer of 2005 after long discussions of starting a band The first recordings were of a session of improvised playing Three songs were recorded from this session Das Piraten auf der Mondlicht Das berman Ist Spt and Der Kalinka

After some sessions of only improvised music William Johansson and Daniel Thyberg started to write and record songs Later some of these songs would feature on their first album Cornea One of these songs called Approaching Atmosphere was considered to be released on single The band even recorded a music video to the track one problem was that only three of the four members were featured in the video which made some confusion of their lineup

After some recording sessions the band was ready to release their first album called Die Autobahn auf Earth But the material was to badly recorded most of the tracks were recorded live in the studio with only a microphone in the middle and then the idea of releasing this material was turned down But it would later turn out that most of these songs ended up on their soon to come album Cornea but then rerecorded and remade

A video where Sywnthkrawft played most materials live in their studio was recorded This video footage was later destroyed and cannot be restored again The only known songs that were recorded on the video was Approaching Atmosphere Das Piraten auf der Mondlicht Making Adjustments Space and Armageddon Apocalypse which is the only song whom could be restored from the destroyed footage

In the beginning of 2006 William Johansson decided to review the recorded material from the previous year and decided to remake the best songs So the band gathered again to rerecord their old songs with much better equipment than before The sound became much more atmospheric and ambient than before The old single Approaching Atmosphere would become one of the opening tracks of the album The recordings took almost three months to become ready It also took another month to get everything mastered by Geoff Swartz The album was going to be called Cornea

The album got a pretty neutral reception from the critics Some called the music electronic spaceromance and surreal ambient and some kind of electronica The epic track Night Flight and SAZA were considered to be the best songs on the album while Children was considered to be the worst song by far

Following the release of the album a live show was about to take place A lot of songs were rehearsed and not only songs from the new album but also other songs even old tracks from the first recording sessions William Johansson and Daniel Thyberg even wrote lyrics to some of their songs The ones that got lyrics were The Greeting Extermination Das Piraten auf der Mondlicht and Grace from Space the two mentioned first were two tracks from the early days of Sywnthkrawft There were also rumours that the controversial song Afrika was rehearsed but thats not confirmed

At the time of the concert only one in the band William had a keyboard so Gustav Jacobsson and Viktor Jacobsson had to borrow two keyboards while Daniel Thyberg played electric guitar The concert didnt go very good mostly because of technical problems The critics said that the concert were horrible and a waste of time The positive response were that the songs who were from the album Cornea were heavily rearranged and that the new songs were pretty decent The best received track was a new song called Hypernova

Another problem according to the band was that their songs were to long and monotonous The well received songs were those who are not featured on the album The same day a livealbum called Chaos at Caoz was released in very few numbers and is almost impossible to find today Also a new single was released Making Adjustments A new music video was made and the bside was the live performance of Hypernova The single got a very cold reception because the critics didnt want Sywnthkrawft to succeed after their horrible concert

They went back into the studio and recorded some songs most notably Spaceblades Rings of Saturn and a remake of an old song from one of the first session recordings called Paul Newman A setlist were also made for a new concert where the most notably material was a new version of Night Flight and a new song called Saguaroxx After these recordings and the concert the band withdrew and stopped making music for a while

After a time of absence William and Daniel came together and tried to write some new songs but only came up with one Erecto Plasma Later William wrote some new songs himself but also revived some of the songs they recorded before their withdrawal A new EP was made of five songs But this EP was never released and William went back to the studio to write more songs

After an absence Daniel decided to leave the group But William Gustav and Viktor kept playing and creating new music The group decided to release a new album called Goodbye Spaceblade and they started to create more tracks One of these tracks The Photographers Exceptional Pictures for Body and Mind was released as a single and gained some fame and controversy

Later they competed in a competition called Garagerocken 2006 where they ended tied for 4th place A live album of the show was released Tuxedo Junction The new studio album was supposed to be released in late 2006 but after problems with finding a producer the release had to be postponed to May 2007 The style of music was a huge step away from their latest album Cornea All of the songs on the new album are written by William Johansson

At the beginning of 2007 they competed in Musik Direkt where a jury didnt qualify them to the final After the announcement the audience showed their dissatisfaction of the result by sending mails to the arrangers and complaining on different forums on the Internet Many thought they shouldve got a wild card to the final

They gained some fame  controversy for their single The Photographers Exceptional Pictures for Body and Mind On 8 March 2007 it debuted on 1 in the Swedish chart Dalatoppen Theyre known for playing a mix of nonalbum songs and songs featured on different releases on their live concerts They also use an exclusive prerecorded text read by radio and television celebrity Hans Villius as introduction to their concerts

During the summer of 2007 theyve decided to take a twomonth break from performing and instead William has started to work with remakes of all the songs they used to perform live Rumors say that all the songs on Goodbye Spaceblade were remade and might end up as an album William has also started to work on new material for a new Sywnthkrawft album with the working title SK3 The Space Musical

Pope Benedict XVI and Islam
During his papal tenure Pope Benedict XVI focused on building on the outreach of his predecessors towards Islam particularly on the efforts of Pope John Paul II who experts say established trust and opened opportunities for dialogue with Muslims One of the important milestones in the Popes efforts included a religious and peaceful initiative called A Common Word This was provoked by an illconceived 2006 lecture he delivered at a university in Regensburg Germany which prompted Muslim leaders to gather and make overtures to their Christian and Jewish counterparts Later on Pope Benedict pursued key initiatives that helped foster Christian and Muslim dialogue These were founded on the Popes belief that Christians and Muslims have shared religious experience and that Christianity and Islam are both theologically founded in Gods irruptive call  heard in the midst of mans ordinary daily existence

The Pope strongly condemned the Mohammed cartoons first published by a Danish newspaper and later in other European papers saying In the international context we are living at present the Catholic Church continues convinced that to foster peace and understanding between peoples and men it is necessary and urgent that religions and their symbols be respected He also added that this implies that believers of various religions not be the object of provocations that wound their lives and religious sentiments Pope Benedict XVI noted that for believers as for all people of good will the only path that can lead to peace and fraternity is respect for the convictions and religious practices of others

Pope Benedict XVI has called for Christians as to open their arms and hearts to Muslim immigrants and to dialogue with them on religious issues The Pope told participants that the Catholic Church is increasingly aware that interreligious dialogue is a part of its commitment to the service of humanity in the modern world In fact this conviction has become the daily bread of those who work with migrants refugees and itinerant peoples he said Pope Benedict described this dialogue between Christians and Muslims as important and delicate Many communities have experienced this he said as they worked to build relations of mutual knowledge and respect with Muslim immigrants which are extremely useful in overcoming prejudices and closed minds For this reason he added Christians are called to open their arms and hearts to everyone whatever their country of origin leaving the task of formulating appropriate laws for the promotion of healthy existence to the authorities responsible for public life

On September 11 2006 the leaders of Muslim communities in Italy endorsed statements by Pope Benedict XVI who warned that Africa and Asia feel threatened by the Wests materialism and secularism We agree with the Pope said Roberto Piccardo the spokesman of Italys largest Muslim group UCOII It is true that Muslims are puzzled by a West which is hostage to a materialistic system Mario Scialoja the former president of the World Muslim League also expressed support for the popes words saying that the Wests exclusion of God leads to the wrong life models On October 21 the Vatican for the first time released a document in Arabic a speech of the Vatican UNESCO representative which addresses scientific and ethical issues The next day the Pope sent his cordial greetings to Muslims as they celebrated the ending of the holy month of Ramadan I am happy to send cordial greetings to Muslims around the world who are these days celebrating the end of the Ramadan fasting month said the Pope at the VaticanI send them all my wishes for serenity and peace he added 

The October 2006 edition of La Civilt Cattolica  the authoritative magazine of the Rome Jesuits printed with the supervision and authorization of the Vatican authorities  opened with an editorial on Islam that furnished a very detailed and alarming description of fundamentalist and terrorist Islam behind which there are great and powerful Islamic states an Islam aiming at the conquest of the world and fostered by violence for the cause of Allah But it does this without even the slightest note of criticism of this nexus of violence and faith And it is as if this nexus were an inescapable reality against which the West and the Church should do little or nothing little at the practical level  its enough to look over the scant measures against terrorism that are recommended  and nothing at the theoretical level For its part the editorial seems to say that Islam is the way it is and must be accepted as such 

On November 10 2006 Pope Benedict urged his fellow German Catholics to discuss their faith in Jesus Christ openly with the Muslims living there The Pontiff said the Roman Catholic Church viewed Muslims with respect and good will They mostly hold on to their religious convictions and rites with great seriousness and have a right to see our humble and strong witness for Jesus Christ he said after noting that modern German society had been largely secularized To do this convincingly we need to make serious efforts So wherever there are many Muslims there should be Catholics with sufficient knowledge of languages and Church history to enable them to talk with Muslims The same month the Pope received in audience an Algerian Muslim philosopher known for his commitment to battling religious hatred I was impressed by his welcome and attention face to face Mustapha Cherif an expert on Islam at the University of Algiers told the Zenit News Service The Pope said dialogue among Christians Muslims and Jews was vital and urged Christians in the Middle East not to abandon the region Interreligious and intercultural dialogue is not just an option but a vital necessity for our times he told members of a foundation on interreligious dialogue Christians needed to find the ties that unite them with the worlds other two great monotheistic religions

Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone said in an interview in an Italian newspaper that the Pontifical Council for InterReligious Dialogue which specializes in relations with Muslims would be made a separate office and no longer merged with the Vaticans cultural office

The head of the Vaticans Pontifical Council for Interfaith Dialogue said on March 26 2006 that the war in Iraq should not be viewed as a crusade launched by Christian countries against Muslims and that Western was not synonymous to Christian Pope Benedict XVI like his predecessor John Paul II never ceases to say this and show it by his acts such as opposition to armed intervention in Iraq He said that the church is not western but catholic

Pope Benedict XVI condemned preemptive war It was the Popes view that the invasion of Iraq has no moral justification As a cardinal Benedict was critical about President George W Bushs choice of sending an army into the heart of Islam to impose democracy The damage would be greater than the values one hopes to save he concluded He also said that The concept of preventive war does not appear in The Catechism of the Catholic Church

The Vatican condemned the execution of Saddam Hussein as a tragic event and warned that it risked fomenting a spirit of vendetta and sowing fresh violence in Iraq A capital punishment is always tragic news a reason for sadness even if it deals with a person who was guilty of grave crimes said Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi The position of the Church against capital punishment has been restated often he said The killing of the guilty party is not the way to reconstruct justice and reconcile society On the contrary there is a risk that it will feed a spirit of vendetta and sow new violence he said

At Easter Pope Benedict XVI lamented the continual slaughter in Iraq and unrest in Afghanistan as he denounced violence in the name of religion 
Afghanistan is marked by growing unrest and instability Benedict said In the Middle East besides some signs of hope in the dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian Authority unfortunately nothing positive comes from Iraq torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees

Pope Benedict XVI in his first Easter message on April 16 2006 called for a peaceful solution in the nuclear standoff with Iran saying Concerning the international crises linked to nuclear power may an honorable solution be found for all parties through serious and honest negotiations Tony Blair was granted a private audience with the Pope in June at the Vatican at the end of a weeklong trip to Italy The Pope told the Prime Minister to pursue diplomatic solutions to problems with states in the Middle East including Iran A Vatican spokesman said The Pope did stress that diplomacy and not conflict was the best way forward The two leaders also discussed how moderate voices from the worlds main religions need to work together to tackle extremism and reduce the risk of terrorism

German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the Middle East and Iran with Pope Benedict in a private audience in August 2006 She came out of her hourlong audience saying it was a very impressive experience We had a very intense exchange on world politics especially on the Middle East but also on how the international community should deal with Iran Pope Benedict has been contacted by Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Tehran faces international isolation for its nuclear program

The following month Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed respect for Pope Benedict XVI and said the pontiff had modified his remarks that offended Muslims worldwideWe respect the Pope and all those interested in peace and justice Ahmadinejad told a news conference before departing for Venezuela I understand that he has modified the remarks he made

The Pope met Irans Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki in December and called for dialogue to overcome conflicts in an apparent reference to Tehrans standoff with the West over its atomic programme The Vatican said in a statement that the Pope exchanged warm wishes with MottakiThe problems of people are always resolved through dialogue mutual comprehension and in peace the Vatican said Mottaki during a private audience with the leader of the worlds 1000 million Roman Catholics delivered a letter to the Pope from Ahmadinejad The message is completely nonpolitical Ehsan Jahandideh a presidential office spokesman was quoted as saying by Irans ISNA students news agencyThe president has emphasised in the message that cooperation of divine religions will help resolving problems of mankind it said

On May 4 2007 former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami met Pope Benedict and said the wounds between Christians and Muslims were still very deep including those caused by a controversial papal speech last September Khatami became one of the most prominent Muslim clerics to visit the Vatican since the Popes controversial Regensburg speech which angered Muslims by appearing to link Islam and violenceThe Vatican said Khatami and the Pope met for about 30 minutes and spoke through interpreters about the dialogue among cultures to overcome current tensions and promote peace In talks that a spokesman called cordial they also discussed the problems of minority Christians in Iran and the Middle East and encouraged peace efforts such as the conference on Iraqs future taking place in Sharm ElSheikh Egypt In December Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent a Christmas message to the Pope saying that he hoped the Christian feast would bring peace and tranquility founded upon justice and spirituality to the international community He told the Pontiff that he hoped the new year 2008 would bring the elimination of oppression of violence and of discrimination

The Pope called for the establishment of a Palestinian state He said May the international community which reaffirms Israels just right to exist in peace assist the Palestinian people to overcome the precarious conditions in which they live and to build their future moving towards the constitution of a state that is truly their own

The Pope received the first Bethlehem Passport from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the Vatican on December 3 2005 The citation reads

In that the bearer of this passport is a citizen of Bethlehem that they recognise this ancient city provides a light to the world and to all people who uphold the values of a just and open society that they will remain a true friend to Bethlehem through its imprisonment and that they will strive to keep the ideals of Bethlehem alive as long as the wall stands we ask you to respect the bearer of the passport and to let them pass freely

The passport is an initiative of the Open Bethlehem foundation which was founded in November 2005 with the support of Bethlehem civil institutions and world figures including former USA President Jimmy Carter and Archbishop Desmond Tutu

On June 14 2006 Pope Benedict XVI urged Israelis and Palestinians in his weekly general audience to return to negotiation after the increasingly blind titfortat violence The Vatican said in a statement that the pope felt close to the innocent victims of such violence and that the Holy Land had become hostage to those who delude themselves they can solve the ever more dramatic problems of the region by force or unilateral action The Vatican appealed to both sides to show due respect for human life especially that of unarmed civilians and children In its statement the Vatican urged the resumption with courage of the path of negotiations the only one that can lead to the just and lasting peace we all aspire to It also urged the international community to rapidly activate funds for humanitarian aid to Palestinians Later that month the Pope called for serene and peaceful coexistence in the Middle East Referring to Eastern Catholic Churches in the Holy Land the Pope said

the serious difficulties it is going through because of profound insecurity lack of work innumerable restrictions and consequent growing poverty are a cause of pain for us all I invite pastors faithful and everyone in positions of responsibility in the civil community to favour mutual respect between cultures and religions and to create as soon as possible the conditions for serene and peaceful coexistence throughout the Middle East
On July 14 2006 The Vatican condemned Israels strikes on Lebanon saying they were an attack on a sovereign nation Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano said Pope Benedict and his aides were very worried that the developments in the Middle East risked degenerating into a conflict with international repercussions In particular the Holy See deplores right now the attack on Lebanon a free and sovereign nation and assures its closeness to these people who already have suffered so much to defend their independence he told Vatican Radio

Two days later the Pope prayed that God grant the fundamental gift of harmony bringing political leaders back on the path of reason and opening new possibilities for dialogue and understanding In these days the news from the Holy Land are all cause for new grave worry in particular the widening of belligerent actions even in Lebanon and for the numerous victims among the civilian population At the origin of these merciless conflicts are unfortunately objective situations of violation of rights and of justice But neither terrorist acts nor retaliation above all when there are tragic consequences for the civilian population can be justified going down such roads  bitter experience has shown  does not bring positive results Later that month Pope Benedict stated that he did not plan to intervene diplomatically in the Middle East fighting but called on people of all religions to join Sundays worldwide day of prayers for peace I think it is best to leave that to the diplomats because we dont enter politics But we do everything for peace Our goal is simply peace and we will do everything to help attain peace Benedict told reporters as he returned from an hourlong hike in the Italian Alps The Pope has set aside Sunday as a worldwide day of prayers for peace hoping the prayers will bring a halt to the fighting Benedict invited everyone to pray especially Muslims and Jews Benedict said he had heard from Catholic communities in Lebanon and Israel especially from Lebanon who implored us as they have implored the Italian government to help We will help with our prayers and with the people we have in  in Lebanon

Pope Benedict XVI appealed on July 30 2006 for an immediate ceasefire in the Middle East hours after the deadliest attack in nearly three weeks of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah In the name of God I appeal to all those responsible for this spiral of violence so that they immediately put down their arms on all sides Immediately I appeal to governing leaders and to international institutions not to spare any effort to obtain this necessary cessation of hostilities In this moment I cannot help but think of the situation ever more grave and more tragic that the Middle East is going through hundreds of dead so many wounded a huge number of the homeless and refugees houses cities and infrastructure destroyed These facts demonstrate clearly that you cannot reestablish justice create a new order and build authentic peace when you resort to instruments of violence

With the war in Lebanon the Vaticans Middle East policies under Pope Benedict XVI came into clearer focus Pope Benedicts pleas to stop the carnage particularly after an Israeli air raid killed many civilians in Qana echoed the dramatic appeals of Pope John Paul during times of Mideast conflict In private talks Vatican officials asked that the US government use its influence with Israel to bring an immediate halt to hostilities To the Israelis the Vatican made it clear that it views its military offensive in Lebanon as a disproportionate use of force On August 7 2006 Pope Benedict XVI renewed his appeal for peace in the Middle East and said he was deeply disappointed that calls for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon had been ignored Faced with the bitter fact that up to now the calls for an immediate ceasefire in that martyred region have been disregarded I feel impelled to renew my pressing appeal to that effect asking everyone to offer their real contribution to the construction of a just and lasting peace Pope Benedict donated two ambulances and emergency medical supplies to Caritas in Lebanon 

War is the worst solution for everyone he has said It brings nothing of good for anyone not even for the apparent victors We know this well in Europe after the two world wars What everyone needs is peace There are moral forces ready to help people understand that the only solution is that we must live together He said the Vaticans actions and his own appeals were designed to mobilize all the potential forces of peace

Pope Benedict sent a special envoy to Lebanon to lead prayers for peace The Pope has asked Roger Etchegaray a French Cardinal who was often the late Pope John Pauls special envoy to trouble spots to transmit to the suffering population  his spiritual proximity and real solidarity While the French cardinals mission is essentially religious to try to celebrate Mass on Sunday with the patriarch of Lebanons Maronite church the Vatican says he may also meet President mile Lahoud and Prime Minister Fouad Siniora Etchegaray 83yearold president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace was sent by Pope John Paul to Iraq in early 2003 to meet Saddam Hussein and try to avert war

The Pope encouraged Syria to use its influence to help resolve Middle East conflicts and counter terrorism He told Syrias ambassador that he was heartened by the diplomats assurances that Damascus is committed to counter this growing threat to peace and stability The world looks especially to countries with significant influence in the Middle East in the hopeful expectation of signs of progress toward the resolution of these longstanding conflicts the Pope said A UN General Assembly resolution in September demanded that Israel withdraw from the Golan Heights which it annexed from Syria in 1967 You have spoken of your governments concern over the annexation of the Golan Heights by Israel in 1967 Benedict said referring to a speech that was just delivered by the ambassador Makram Obeid as the envoy presented his credentials Like many impartial observers the Holy See believes that solutions are possible within the framework of international law through the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions the pontiff said

The Pope met Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas in April 2007 for talks that focused on the situation in the Middle East the Vatican said in a statement In particular an appreciation was expressed for the relaunch also thanks to the efforts of the international community of the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians the statement said Benedict also discussed the difficulty faced by Catholics in the Palestinian territories and the value of their contribution to that society it added

On September 12 2006 while lecturing on Faith Reason and the University at the University of Regensburg where he was formerly a professor Pope Benedict quoted the opinion of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached In the original German Benedict XVI described this critical opinion of Manuel II as addressed with a startling brusqueness in erstaunlich schroffer uns berraschend schroffer Form 
The Pope later explained that the remark was meant to compare early Muslim teaching on religious freedom with the later teaching on jihad and was cited as part of a larger theological assertion that reason and faith go hand in hand and that the concept of a holy war is always unreasonable and against the nature of God Muslim or Christian 

The quotation from this medieval text drew criticism from a number of individual governmental representatives and Muslim religious leaders including Yusuf AlQaradawi Hamza Yusuf and Ali Bardakolu the Director of Religious Affairs of Turkey as well as the governments of Somalia and Pakistan and Indias major political parties Some critics claimed the Pope made a number of historical errors The main one being that although the Pope had said that verse 2256 stating There is no compulsion in religion was an early verse when Mohamed was powerless in Mecca this verse was one of the latest verses to be added to the Quran in Medina at a time when the Muslim state was powerful thereby taking a lot of weight out of the Popes statement Others have noted a heavy reliance on analogia entis rather than analogia fidei and to consider faith as the common ground in the approach to Islam

The Director of the Vatican press office Federico Lombardi explained the Popes statement It was certainly not the intention of the Holy Father to undertake a comprehensive study of the jihad and of Muslim ideas on the subject still less to offend the sensibilities of Muslim faithful Quite the contrary what emerges clearly from the Holy Fathers discourses is a warning addressed to Western culture to avoid the contempt for God and the cynicism that considers mockery of the sacred to be an exercise of freedom

There were public protests including violent ones in the West Bank where two churches were firebombed over his comments in various countries in the subsequent days There has been a death threat on the Pope since the lecture from a group linked to Al Qaeda 
Pope Benedict expressed his regret for any offense his words had given The Holy Father is very sorry that some passages of his speech may have sounded offensive to the sensibilities of Muslim believers said Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone in a statement According to CNN the Vatican comments fell short of a literal apology 

On September 17 2006 from the balcony at his residence at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome Pope Benedict publicly expressed that he was deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries and stressed that the words which were considered offensive were not his own but were quoted from a medieval text and that his speech was intended to act as an invitation to mutually respectful dialogue with Muslims rather than an attempt to cause offense A few days later the Pope held a meeting at his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo with approximately 20 Muslim diplomats At this meeting the Pope Benedict expressed total and profound respect for all Muslims Among the ambassadors invited included Iraq Iran Turkey Morocco and many other nations and Islamic Groups

The following month Pope Benedict XVI took another step to placate anger in the Islamic world over his remarks on holy war making additions to his original text affirming that a quotation from a 14thcentury Byzantine emperor was not his personal opinionThe original said the emperors remark was made somewhat brusquely In the new version it says it was made with a brusqueness that we find unacceptable Benedict added in a footnote In the Muslim world this quotation has unfortunately been taken as an expression of my personal position thus arousing understandable indignation I hope that the reader of my text can see immediately that this sentence does not express my personal view of the Quran for which I have the respect due to the holy book of a great religion He said he cited the text as part of an examination of the relationship between faith and reason

An open letter was sent to Pope Benedict XVI by 38 Muslim authorities later extended to 100 express an acceptance for his apology over his remarks on Islam The signatories to the letter declare that they accept the Popes personal expression of sorrow and assurance that the controversial quote did not reflect his personal opinion Some of the clerics who signed the letter were Shaikh Habib Ali of the Tabah Institute in Abu Dhabi and Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad the special adviser to Jordans King Abdullah II Others who signed the letter include the grand muftis of Egypt Russia Bosnia Croatia Kosovo and Metohija Serbia Turkey Uzbekistan and Oman as well as the Iranian Shiite cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Taskhiri and Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr of George Washington University Washington

Pope Benedict XVI said his forthcoming visit to Turkey in 2006 was a sign of the friendship he held for the Turkish people As you all know I am leaving for Turkey on Tuesday the Pontiff said in his weekly Angelus prayer in Rome on the preceding Sunday Starting right now I want to send a cordial greeting to the dear Turkish people rich in history and culture To these people and their representatives I express feelings of esteem and sincere friendship The Pope said he backed Turkeys bid to join the European Union Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoan said after meeting the pontiff upon his arrival in Ankara for his first visit to a Muslim country The Pope told Erdoan that while the Vatican seeks to stay out of politics it desires Turkeys membership in the EU

The Pope had reversed his earlier opposition to Turkeys efforts to join the EU appearing to back the overwhelmingly Muslim countrys hardfought push towards membership at the start of his visit The Pope expressed hope that Turkey would join the EU A papal spokesman later clarified the remarks saying the Pope had told the Turkish leader the Vatican did not have the power to intervene but viewed positively and encouraged the process of Turkeys entry into the EU on the basis of common values and principles Mr Erdoan said The most important message the Pope gave was toward Islam reiterating his view of Islam as peaceful and affectionate

Pope Benedict XVI visited one of Turkeys most famous mosques in what was seen as an attempt to mend relations with the Muslim community During his tour of the Blue Mosque in Istanbul accompanied by local art historian Dr Sedat Bornoval the pontiff turned towards Mecca in a gesture of Muslim prayer together with Prof Dr Mustafa arc Mufti of stanbul It marked only the second papal visit in history to a Muslim place of worship Earlier the Pope visited the nearby Hagia Sophia Museum  a site heavy with Christian and Muslim symbolism  drawing a large crowd of protesters

The Papal trip to Turkey was widely hailed as a success The aim was to mend fences there and as he was greeted on his return by Italian leader Romano Prodi the pontiff appeared to have succeeded in this Ilter Turan a professor of political science in Istanbul said Visiting the Blue Mosque and praying with the Muslims indicated that maybe he had not expressed himself carefully in his earlier conversations with students at Regensburg and certainly his gestures will go a long way to alleviate the initial scar that was left by his remarks The Pope also praised Islam as a peaceful faith and expressed support for Turkeys bid to join the EU

The prayer in Istanbuls Blue Mosque was not initially planned but it turned out to be very meaningful It was a prayer to the one Lord of heaven and earth merciful father of all mankind Addressing todays general audience this was how Benedict XVI described his silent prayer on 30 November in Istanbul The Pope thanked divine Providence for this and said May all believers identify themselves with the one God and bear witness to true brotherhood The Pontiff augured that Turkey will be a bridge of friendship and collaboration between East and West and he thanked the Turkish people for the cordiality and sympathy they showed him throughout his stay when he felt loved and understood

The Vatican considered Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogans strong victory in the 2007 general election in Turkey the best result for Europe and for the Christian churches In an interview published by Italian daily Corriere della Sera Cardinal Sergio Sebastiani also invited the European Union to resume talks with Ankara on Turkeys entry to the bloc

Francesc Palu
Francesc Palu or Francisco Palu 17231789 was a Spanish Franciscan missionary administrator and historian on the Baja California Peninsula and in Alta California Palu made significant contributions to the Alta California and Baja California mission systems Along with his mentor Junpero Serra Palu worked to build numerous missions throughout Alta and Baja California many structures of which still stand today A member of the Franciscan Order Palu became Presidente of the missions in Baja California and later of missions of Alta California Palus work in the Spanish mission system spans from his early twenties to his death at the age of 66
According to biographer Herbert E Bolton Fray Palu was a diligent student devout Christian loyal disciple tireless traveler zealous missionary firm defender of the faith resourceful pioneer successful mission builder able administrator and fair minded historian of California Palu is particularly noted for his pious biography of Serra and for his multivolume early history of the Californias

Francisco born Francesc Palu was born in Palma Majorca Spain where he joined the Franciscan Order Together with Junpero Serra he traveled to New Spain in 1740 and served as a missionary in the Sierra Gorda region of Quertaro When the Jesuits were expelled from Baja California in 1768 the Franciscans under Serra were sent to replace them Palu was assigned to the mission of San Javier The following year Serra went north to find the new mission province of Alta California and Palu succeeded him as head of the Baja California missions When the Dominicans took over the peninsular Baja California missions in 1773 Palu being Franciscan moved on to Upper California marking the geographical boundary between the two orders fields He assisted in the exploration of the site of San Francisco and administered Mission San Francisco de Ass When Serra died Palu was briefly acting head of the Baja California missions but soon returned to central Mexico

As a missionary of the Spanish colonization of the Americas Palu traveled and proselytized in the Spanish colonial empire His extensive travels left him knowledgeable of world matters and wellrespected as a scholar Coming from simple beginnings Palu was born in 1723 at Palma on the Island of Majorca and began religious work early in his life as he entered the Franciscan Order around the age of seventeen in 1739 After developing a mentorstudent relationship with Junpero Serra they both eagerly joined the Spanish mission system in Alta California They along with several other missionaries reached Veracruz New Spain in 1749 Palu worked in New Spain for many in missions such as Sierra Gorda He was later recalled along with Serra to work in the San Saba region of Texas However the biggest part of Palus journey would not begin until 1767 when he and fourteen other Franciscan friars were sent north to extend their efforts and replace many of the Jesuit missionaries who had been previously expelled from Spain Much of Palus life would be spent in Alta California and many of his notable endeavors occurred there as well

Palu and the other friars reached Loreto in Lower California in the spring of 1768 Palou was given control of Mission San Francisco Javier The following year Junipero Serra left for Alta California to proceed with the further establishment of missions in that region This left the office of president or superior of all missions in Lower California for Palu to control until 1773 When the Lower Californian missions were turned over to the Dominican missionaries Palu was able to rejoin his brethren and mentor in Upper California He first went to San Diego then continued onwards to Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in presentday Carmel which Serra had been using as his headquarters Palu greatly assisted in the placement of friars and recorded historical data the only surviving account of some aspects of the early California missions

In 1774 Palu accompanied Captain Riveras expedition to the Bay of San Francisco and on December 4 planted the cross on a hill he named Lobos wolves which sits in clear view of the Golden Gate and Pacific Ocean The name lives on as Lobos Creek within the Presidio of San Francisco

The Rivera expedition returned to the Presidio of Monterey via the coastal route first explored by the Portol expedition of 1769 At the north end of Monterey Bay Rivera and Palu inspected the area around todays Santa Cruz described by friar Juan Cresp who accompanied Portol and recommended by Cresp as a future mission site Palu agreed and on December 9 selected a location where Mission Santa Cruz was later founded by Fermn Lasun in 1791

Palu returned to Lobos in 1776 with the De Anza expedition and on June 28 offered up the first mass at the future site of Mission Dolores which Palu founded but a few weeks later Palu remained at the new mission until he was called to give his mentor and close friend Junpero Serra his last rites in 1784 at Mission San Carlos

With Serras death Palu became the acting presidente of the Upper California missions until the formal appointment of Lasun as successor to Serra Palu remained at Mission San Carlos until failing health and old age led him to retire in 1785 to the missionary College of San Fernando de Mexico He was elected guardian of the college and held this office until his death in Mexico where he had completed his biography of Serra most of which he had written while still in California

Francisco Palu played many key roles and offices vital to the establishment of several of the missions in California and many of those in Mexico He compiled a standard history of the California missions from 1767 to 1784 in his noticias as a fourvolume set He also wrote of his teacher Junpero Serra Both works provide key information about early California and the missionary system established there

Asma bint Shihab
Asma Bint Shihab alSulayhiyya died 1087 was the queen and coruler of Yemen in coregency with her cousin and spouse Ali alSulayhi and later her son Ahmad alMukkaram and daughterinlaw Arwa alSulayhi from 1047 until 1087 Her full title as sovereign alSayyida alHurratul translates to The noble lady who is free and independent the woman sovereign who bows to no superior authority As female sovereign Asma bint Shihab has an almost unique position in history though there were more female monarchs in the international Muslim world Asma bint Shihab and Arwa alSulayhi were the only female monarchs in the Muslim Arab world to have had the khutba proclaimed in their name in the mosques as sovereigns 

Asma bint Shihab married her cousin Ali alSulayhi sultan and founder of the Sulayhid dynasty The marriage between Ali and Asma was reportedly a happy one and Ali relied on her support on his way to power and participated in the sacrifices his religious faith placed upon him 

When Ali became king in 1047 he named her queen malika but not merely his consort but his formally acknowledged coruler and political partner who governed the realm of Yemen by his side In recognition of this her name was proclaimed alongside that of her spouse in the Khutba the traditional privilege of a sovereign in a Muslim state the khutba was proclaimed from the pulpits of the mosques of Yemen in her husbands name and in her name after the Fatimid sovereign and her husband May Allah prolong the days of alHurra the perfect who manages the affairs of the faithful with care This was the first time ever in history when the name of a woman had been proclaimed in the khutba Another almost unique occurrence was that queen Asma bint Shihab attended councils with her face uncovered that is to say unveiled

Muhammad alThawr described her She was one of the most famous women of her time and one of the most powerful She was munificent She was a poetess who composed verses Among the praises given her husband alSulayhi by the poets was the fact that he had her for a wife   When he ascertained the perfection of her character her husband entrusted the management of state business to her He rarely made decisions that went against her advice and  regarded her with very great respect and never gave any other opinion precedence over hers

In 1067 during the pilgrimage to Mecca the Banu Najah clan under Said Ibn Najah the prince of Zabid attacked the travel party of Ali and Asma killed Ali and took Asma prisoner She was sequestered in a secret prison in Zabid and reportedly the severed head of her spouse was planted on a pole visible from her cell After a years imprisonment she managed to get a message through to her son and daughterinlaw in Sana and her son stormed Zabid and freed her

Asma returned to her realm and assisted her son Ahmad alMukkaram and daughterinlaw Arwa alSulayhi with the management of the realm until she died When she met her son alMukarram she confirmed him as his fathers successor but when he was paralyzed shortly afterward she retook control as the coregent of the realm together with her daughterinlaw Arwa who was to be her coruler in accordance with the will of her son as he was himself unable to rule because of his condition 

Queen Asma was sometime affectionally referred to as the Little Queen of Sheba according to Muhammad alThawr Some poets carried away by their admiration of Asma went so far as to declaim that if the throne of the queen of Sheba had been magnificent that of Asma was still more so This is somewhat remarkable as the queen of Sheba belonged to the jahiliyya the time before Islam which was traditionally viewed as a negative one Another name used both for her and her daughterinlaw and coregent was malika hazima malika means queen and hazim was an epithet awarded people regarded to have shown the utmost wisdom and judgement in political affairs

Leon Gilbert
Leon Aaron Gilbert Jr November 9 1920 March 28 1999 of York Pennsylvania was a decorated World War II combat veteran and a lieutenant in the allblack 24th U S Infantry Regiment that fought in the Korean War His courtmartial for refusing to obey an order from the regiments white commanding officer led to worldwide protests and increased attention to segregation and racism in the US military

By the early 1950s various Executive Orders had been issued attempting to end segregation in the US armed forces They had been largely ineffectual The 24th Infantry Regiment which consisted entirely of black soldiers was thrown into the forefront of the Korean fighting at the outset

Casualties in the 24th were extremely heavy and replacements and supplies including shoes were slow in coming Stories began to filter out through various black news sources of atrocities committed by white American officers against the black troops they were leading At one point the US Air Force bombed the 24th by mistake resulting in serious casualties

On August 6 1951 Colonel Arthur S Champeny a white man was appointed the 24ths commanding officer and informed them he was going to change their reputation from the frightened 24th to the fighting 24th

Leon Aaron Gilbert Jr was born in York Pennsylvania on November 9 1920 the eldest of two sons of a blacksmith who had also served in World War I He was educated in local schools and enlisted in the U S Army at Harrisburg Pennsylvania on August 16 1940 He served with the 92d Division in Italy and was honorably discharged in 1946 then called up again as a reservist in 1947 He was thus a decorated veteran with a record of ten years service in the Army He and his wife Kay had two children with a third on the way

In the fall of 1950 Gilbert was in command of Company A of the 24th having taken over when his commanding officer was wounded He received an order to return with twelve of his men to a forward position Gilberts company had been forced to withdraw from that position after coming under heavy machine gun fire at close to point blank range so to return to that position would have been tantamount to suicide When Gilbert refused the order to return he was arrested and tried on the spot Despite Gilberts suffering from shock and fatigue due to prolonged heavy fighting according to a letter to his wife they had gone thirteen days without food or water he was accused of insubordination and cowardice and a court martial sentenced him to death In an interview with the New York Times Gilbert gave his version of the incident

I did not refuse to obey the order I was trying to explain why it couldnt be carried out There were twelve men in my command Then I considered it my duty as an officer to show why the order meant certain death

A storm of public protest erupted around the world in reaction to the sentencing in the US labor leaders church leaders and the American Legion became involved and the National Negro Council collected 600000 signatures on a petition for his pardon President Harry S Truman commuted the sentence to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay and pension allowances

In September 1952 the sentence was reduced to seventeen years for battle misconduct Gilbert served five years the maximum penalty for disobedience under peacetime conditions war was never officially declared in Korea before he was released

Following the courtmartialing of Lieutenant Gilbert mass courtmartialing of whole units of the 24th Regiment ensued with no comparable action being taken against white units

Thurgood Marshall general counsel of the NAACP wrote The letters we have received from convicted soldiers and the talks we have had with war correspondents strongly indicate that many of these men have been victimized by racial discrimination It seems apparent that some of them are being made scapegoats for the failures of higher personnel

In 1996 an official Army report noted that Gilberts regiment performed poorly in the early years of the Korean War as did many white units but went on to say There was no single reason for what happened to the 24thAn aggressive enemy old and worn equipment inexperience at all levels leadership failures high and low casualties among key personnel and a lack of bonding and cohesion in some units all played their part There was no lack of courage among the officers and men

The incident scarred Gilbert for life His father had died while he was in custody and five years after he was released on parole his wife divorced him Gilbert returned to his hometown of York Pennsylvania remarried and lived quietly until his death Although he never stopped trying to clear his name to little avail his last years were cheered somewhat by the fact that his surviving comradesinarms had never forgotten him and after they had located him welcomed him back into their ranks As one of them reported He didnt know if we would accept him We welcomed him with open arms No matter what was written no matter what was said we know the facts We were there

Renix
Renix Renix Electronique was a joint venture by Renault and Bendix that designed and manufactured automobile electronic ignitions fuel injection systems electronic automatic transmission controls and various engine sensors Major applications included various Renault and Volvo vehicles The name became synonymous in the US with the computer and fuel injection system used on the AMCJeep 25L I4 and 40L I6 engines

The term Renix also has a number of applications In certain carburetor equipped Renault and Volvo models it provides an electronic ignition system consisting of an engine control unit ECU to replace the job of contact breaker points in the distributor The system uses an angle sensor and a number of fuel sensors to provide a maintenancefree ignition system The ECU is sealed and cannot be serviced and the EPROM cannot be reprogrammed

Later the name was synonymous with a form of fuel injection In such an application it consisted of an ECU and a number of sensors It was first seen in engines produced by Renault Renault 21 25 and Espace in and capacities It is better known in America for its application in the AMC 40L displacing straight6 engines Production began by American Motors AMC with the 1987 Jeep Cherokee XJ models It was preceded by the AMC Computerized Engine Control and followed by Chryslers Mopar MPI system

Renix Electronique SA was established in 1981 as a joint venture by Renault with 51 interest and Bendix with 49 that was headquartered in Toulouse Renix Corporation of America was the North American subsidiary of Renix Electronique to provide sales logistics engineering and quality support to American Motors

When Renault encountered financial troubles in 1985 it sold its interest in Renix to AlliedSignal a major auto industry supplier and the new owner of Bendix Renix Corporation of America was also absorbed by AlliedSignal Corporation when it purchased Renix Electronique from Renault The US200 million Allied buyout of Renaults 51 of Renix made it part of Bendix Electronics and Engine Controls Renix products will be produced in France and marketed worldwide under the Bendix brand name In 1988 the French Bendix site is sold to Siemens VDO In 2008 Siemens AG sells its VDO branch to Continental automotive group

The Renix system was used in the J series engines as fitted to the Renault 19 16V Renault 21 and SavannaNevada the Renault 25 and the Renault Espace It was a multipoint fuel injection system as opposed to a singlepoint system with a number of air throttle and pinking sensors and an advanced computer Application of the system could first be seen in 1984 three years before its American debut The Renix system pushed the power of the carburetorfed engine from  It could also be found in 22L engines fitted to R21 25 and Espace models

The Renix fuel injection and a Garrett turbocharger was used in the midmounted V6 powering the Renault Alpine GTAA610 sports car

AMCRenault uses a fully integrated electronic engine control system made by Renix
The Renix electronic ignition system consists of a solidstate Ignition Control Module ICM a distributor a crankshaft position sensor and an Electronic Control Unit ECU The Renix ECU has a powerful microprocessor that was advanced technology for its time It also incorporates an engine knocking sensor that allows the computer to know if detonation is occurring thus allowing the computer to make adaptive control by individual cylinder corrections to prevent pinging The knock detection uses the signal from a wide bank accelerometer mounted on the cylinder head Good signal to noise ratio is obtained primarily through angular discrimination

The Renix system has more inputs than the later Mopar system and in some ways is more complex Its knock sensor automatically tunes the spark advance curve to an optimum mix for each cylinder Some Renix controlled engines will actually get better fuel economy using higher octane fuel The system on the AMC 40L is flexible allowing the use of a larger camshaft and modifications to the cylinder heads without significant changes to the base computer

The Renix computer was first used on 1986 AMC 25 L fourcylinder enginess The system improved the drivability of the Jeep Cherokee and Comanche over carbureted models The power increase was also noticeable The Renix system was used through the 1990 model year Unfortunately it is handicapped because few scan tools can be plugged in to this onboard diagnostics computer The Renix control system prior to 1991 can be tested only with Chryslers DRB tester and the diagnostic test modes for 1989 and later engines with SBEC controllers differ from those provided for 1988 and earlier models

The Renix control system was only found on the 19871990 Jeep Cherokee and Comanche with AMCdesigned engines the control setup used with the V6 was OBDI General Motors and the early Diesel was a Renault turbodiesel I4 that used its own specific control setup

The Jeep Wrangler YJ did not get the AMC 40 engine until 1991 when it was accompanied by Chryslerdesigned electronics as well Until then it retained the AMC engine with a carburetor No other Jeep vehicle was equipped with Renix electronic controls

In a typical Jeep application the ignition control module ICM is located in engine compartment It consists of a solidstate ignition circuit as well as an integrated ignition coil that can be removed and serviced separately Electronic signals from the ECU to the ICM determine the amount of ignition timing or retard needed to meet engine power requirements The ECU provides an input signal to the ICM The ICM has outputs for a tach signal to the tachometer and a high voltage signal from the coil to the distributor The crankshaft position sensor senses TDC Top Dead Center and BDC crankshaft positions as well as engine rpm This sensor is secured by special shouldered bolts to flywheeldrive plate housing and is not adjustable

The Renix control system is preOBD and therefore does not have a Check Engine Lamp It also does not store or throw Diagnostic Trouble Codes DTCs or Parameter IDs PIDs This is a common problem at vehicle inspection particularly in California and other jurisdictions with emission standards Most inspection stations are not aware and will try to explain the CELMIL doesnt work

In the 1980s Skoda manufactured a small number of rearengined cars with Renix fuel injection These were originally destined for Canada but ended up in Europe These are usually known as 135 GLi or 135 RiC Fuel system parts may be available from ChryslerJeep dealers

The Volvo 700 Series and some of the Volvo 300 Series used a B200K 20L inline4 naturally aspirated engine with Renix ignition and some 300 series Volvos with Renault powerplants The 300 Volvo series is not known US It was manufactured in the Netherlands with a limited production of cars in Malaysia through CKD process

All 300 series Volvo cars with gasoline engines came with RenixBendix ignition 1983 onwards until 1991 when production of the 300 series stopped
Volvo Redblock engines equipped with Renix ignition 

Renault derived units with Renix ignition 

B172K and B18 were based on the Renault FnN n being 1 2 or 3 engines from Renault B14x based on Renault C1J both types were modified for Volvo to varying extent

Percival Vega Gull
The Percival Vega Gull was a 1930s British fourseater touring aircraft built by Percival Aircraft Limited It was a singleengine lowwing Folding woodandfabric monoplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage

Built by Percival Aircraft of Gravesend and Luton after 1936 when Percival Aircraft became a Limited Company the KSeries Vega Gull was a development of their earlier DSeries Gull The main changes from the earlier design were the provision of an additional fourth seat dual controls and flaps The fuselage was widened and the wingspan increased Increases in drag were compensated for by reducing parasitic drag from exterior fittings such as hinges and actuation horns This work was largely attributable to the arrival at Percivals of the talented aircraft designer Arthur Bage Thus the Vega Gull was very nearly as fast as the more svelte Gull Six Payload range and utility were all much improved The prototype GAEAB first flew from Gravesend in November 1935

The Vega Gull retained the de Havilland Gipsy Six aircooled inline engine introduced in the D3 Gull Six of 1934 Most examples were fitted with the optional DH Gipsy Six Series II engine in conjunction with the DHPD30 VP airscrew The final Mk II examples were fitted with a curved windscreen the earlier examples had a multifaceted windscreen of flat panels similar in appearance to the early marks of the Proctor

A Vega Gull named Messenger was used by Beryl Markham on her transatlantic flight 45 September 1936 the first solo easttowest crossing by a woman

Two early production Vega Gulls were entered into the Schlesinger Race from England to Johannesburg South Africa CWA Scott and Giles Guthrie flying Vega Gull GAEKE was the only finisher landing at Rand Airport on 1 October 1936 The aircraft had left Portsmouth 52 hours 56 minutes 48 seconds earlier With the publicity of the win Percival set up a production line at larger premises at Luton The new type was an immediate success with production running to 90 the last production aircraft having its maiden flight on 27 July 1939

The Vega Gull was widely used by British and Commonwealth aviators during the later years of the Golden Age of recordsetting aviation during the 1930s Alex Henshaw Jim Mollison Amy Johnson Beryl Markham CWA Scott and others won races and broke records to South Africa South America Australia and New Zealand to name but a few

In addition to civil orders 15 were ordered by the Air Ministry Of these 11 served with 24 Squadron Royal Air Force on communications duties and two were issued to the Fleet Air Arm which was yet to come under Admiralty control The remaining two were used by the British air attachs in Buenos Aires and Lisbon A third aircraft for use by the British air attach in Berlin was seized by the Germans at the outbreak of the Second World War It remains unclear whether the Luftwaffe subsequently used this machine

After the outbreak of war Vega Gulls were requisitioned for military use In the UK 21 were impressed in 193940 14 for the RAF and seven for the FAA Two aircraft were impressed in each of Australia and India while one other was called to the colours in New Zealand

By the end of the war the Vega Gull had been largely supplanted by its younger sibling the Proctor of which more than 1100 were manufactured Most Proctors especially the later examples were slower and more cumbersome than the original Vega Despite the obvious drawbacks of its wooden airframe in terms of durability the Vega Gull compares favourably with more modern designs To save hangar space the wings could be folded to reduce the space needed for storage


Civil Vega Gulls have been registered in the following countries Argentina Australia Belgium Canada France Germany India Iraq Japan Kenya Netherlands New Zealand Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom and United States

Herman H Pevler
Herman H Pevler 20 April 1903  29 August 1978 was the 10th president of the Roanoke VA based Norfolk and Western Railway NW He had previously served as president of the Wabash Railroad and served as president of the NW from October 1 1963 until his retirement in April 1970

Commonwealth Magazine once described Pevler as a driver who operated with doors open and coats off citing the sheer force of his personality and vigor in his activities He was an alumnus of Purdue University He was buried in Evergreen Burial Park Roanoke Virginia

In 1927 Herman Pevler commenced work with the Pennsylvania Railroad and he was elected Vice President of that railway in 1948

In 1959 he was elected a director of the First National Bank at St Louis

Herman Pevler was the president of Wabash Railroad before he succeeded Stuart T Saunders as President of NW Saunders left to head the Pennsylvania Railroad a major NW stockholder at that time Pevler oversaw consummation of a complex group of mergers begun under Saunders which brought into the NW fold the Nickel Plate Road the Wabash Railroad and portions of the Pennsylvania Railroad The mergers were completed in 1964 and widely expanded the company reaching such major points as Detroit Chicago and St Louis The latter two were major gateways and interchange points with western railroads

Following the expansion NW revenues quadrupled during Pevlers administration Coming from the Wabash he was the first NW president in the 20th century to have not come up through the lower ranks of the NW and his leadership was met with some resistance by some NW staff Among his legacies was a change in NW livery on locomotives to a blue very similar to that employed by the Wabash which became known within the company as Pevler blue As his mandatory retirement age approached it became known that Pevler intended to recommend to the Board of Directors a top official of another railroad as his replacement However quick maneuvering by NW insiders and lobbying of key directors resulted in the selection of John P Fishwick a longtime NW staff attorney who Pevler had assigned to Cleveland to oversee a subsidiary operation

In 1959 Pevler wrote a 12page pamphlet on Featherbedding titled The Changing Railroad Picture

Pevler supported the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966

In 1967 Pevler was named Roanokes Outstanding Citizen

YaleChina Association
The YaleChina Association  formerly YaleinChina is an independent nonprofit organization which seeks to develop educational programs in and about China and further understanding between Chinese and American people Founded in 1901 and originally a Protestant missionary society YaleChinas work is characterized by longterm relationships to build Chinese institutional capacity Current programs include the fields of public health and nursing legal education English language instruction American Studies and cultural exchange for Chinese and American students Publications include a regular newsletter biennial report and the annual YaleChina Health Journal

The YaleChina Association was first incorporated as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society and was known informally as YaleinChina as early as 1913 It was nondenominational from its beginnings and by the 1920s had ceased to be an overtly missionary enterprise It was reincorporated in 1934 as a secular organization the YaleinChina Association and in 1975 as the YaleChina Association

A reflection of the religious fervor sweeping American college campuses at the end of the 19th century which took form in the Student Volunteer Movement YaleChina was founded in 1901 as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society by a group of Yale graduates and faculty members committed to establishing a Christian missionary presence overseas The founders chose China as the focus of their work in part to honor the memory of a Yale graduate from the class of 1892 Horace Tracy Pitkin who had worked in China as a missionary and was killed in 1900 during the Boxer Uprising The city of Changsha in Hunan Province was chosen as the base of operations in China after consultation with other foreign missionaries

At the urging of the home office in New Haven as well as other missionaries in China the Yale Mission early on assumed more of an educational than evangelical function With the arrival of Dr Edward H Hume in 1905 medical education and care became a major focus of the endeavor The educational compound that began with Dr Humes medical clinic eventually grew to comprise a preparatory school the Yali School the College of YaleinChina later moved to Wuhan where it joined two other missionary colleges to form Huachung University and the HsiangYa Medical College Nursing School and Hospital Over the years HsiangYa a compound of hsiang denoting Hunan and ya denoting YaleChina transliterated today as Xiangya developed a reputation for providing the most advanced training in Western medicine in all of central and southern China More than at other foreignaffiliated institutions an effort was made early on to bring as many Chinese faculty and administrators on board as possible By the late 1920s all major leadership positions were held by Chinese and YaleinChina was very much a joint SinoAmerican enterprise

Between 1919 and 1920 future Chairman Mao Zedong had several encounters with the school he edited its student magazine refocusing it on thought reorientation and operated a bookshop out of its medical college

The war years 193745 placed enormous strains on the YaleinChina institutions especially the HsiangYa Hospital which cared for war casualties and refugees For example the life of paralyzed Frank Wattendorf was spared at the hospital before he was evacuated

Many of the Changsha facilities were damaged by invading Japanese troops Nevertheless these challenges served to inspire renewed commitment on the part of both American and Chinese faculty and administrators The YaleinChina staff who returned to Changsha in September 1945 were determined to rebuild the campus and resume their prewar operations Within four years however a Communist insurgency toppled the Nationalist government and YaleinChinas future seemed uncertain in the face of growing hostility between the United States and China

By 1951 the new Communist government had taken possession of YaleinChinas Changsha properties and renamed the Yali School as Liberation Middle School Dr Dwight Rugh YaleinChinas last representative in Changsha spent most of 1950 under house arrest as the only American on campus and was eventually expelled from China in May 1951 With his departure the ties between YaleinChina in New Haven and the institutions in Changsha and Wuhan were broken for nearly 30 years

Between 1951 and 1954 hostility against the United States on the mainland and turmoil on Nationalistheld Taiwan led to a suspension of YaleinChinas work within China Preston Schoyer who had been a Bachelor in Changsha before the war worked both formally and informally to develop new programs and maintain ties with old friends During those years YaleinChina devoted its resources to financing the education of Chinese students in the US while looking in Asia for new projects to support Attention soon focused on a refugee college in the British colony of Hong Kong which had been founded by Chien Mu 18951990 and other Chinese intellectuals determined to preserve traditional Chinese learning and values in the face of the Communist victory on the mainland In early 1954 after a visit to the colony and months of negotiations YaleinChinas trustees formally affiliated the organization with New Asia College

Unlike in Changsha YaleinChinas relationship with New Asia College was by intention one of support and assistance rather than direct administration YaleinChina secured funding from the Ford Foundation and other US foundations to support the development of the college and also provided fellowships for New Asia faculty to pursue further study in the United States In 1956 YaleinChina resumed the practice of sending Bachelors two recent Yale graduates to teach English though now to New Asia College instead of the Yali School

In the late 1950s the possibility of founding a university in Hong Kong that would use Chinese as the language of instruction was explored In 1959 the Council of British Universities selected New Asia United and Chung Chi colleges to federate and form the new Chinese University of Hong Kong which was formally inaugurated in 1963 on its Shatin campus Preston Schoyer played a key role in negotiating New Asias entrance YaleinChina contributed to the new campus by securing funds to construct buildings including the university health clinic the Yali Guest House Friendship Lodge and a student dormitory at New Asia College YaleinChina also contributed to the early internationalization of the campus by helping to establish the New Asia  YaleinChina Chinese Language Centre and the International Asian Studies Programme which now enroll hundreds of international students every year Meanwhile the relationship with New Asia College where the YaleChina Association as the organization was renamed in 1975 has maintained a representative office for fifty years remains a strong one

By the 1970s both New Asia College and the Chinese University of Hong Kong had achieved a level of institutional maturity and financial stability that decreased the need for YaleChinas contributions At the same time the normalization of diplomatic relations between the US and China presented the possibility of resumed activity on the mainland In the fall of 1979 YaleChina staff traveled to Changsha to explore opportunities for academic exchange with administrators and faculty at Hunan Medical College the successor to HsiangYa and several exchange agreements were concluded that led to the arrival of YaleChina English teachers in September 1980 and exchanges of medical personnel between Yale University and Hunan Medical College Two English instructors were also sent to Wuhan University the same year and later to Huazhong Normal University

Despite the geographical continuities however the intervening years had brought substantial changes to Chinese higher education and within YaleChina itself Political sensitivities in China and YaleChinas own evolution determined that any new activity in China would be of a nature substantially different from that of the pre1949 years Rather than seeking to resume the joint administration of the former YaleinChina institutions the emphasis was placed on shorterterm academic exchanges in the fields of medicine and American Studies and a resumption of the English language instruction program Throughout the 1980s YaleChinas medical program brought almost 50 Chinese medical personnel to the US and sent over 40 Americans to China for exchanges of medical knowledge During the same years nearly 100 Yale graduates participated in YaleChinas English teaching program in China YaleChina also continued to send English teachers to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and maintained its involvement with the universitys International Asian Studies Program

The decade of the 1990s brought an expansion of YaleChinas activities into new program areas and affiliations with institutions outside of YaleChinas historical bases in Hong Kong Changsha and Wuhan While maintaining its English teaching program YaleChina initiated projects in environmental protection and pediatric cardiology and facilitated a drama collaboration between New Havens Long Wharf Theater and the Shanghai Peoples Art Theater which resulted in a Chineselanguage stage production of Amy Tans Joy Luck Club in 1994 Other areas of expansion have included the fields of American Studies legal education public health nursing and service in the nonprofit sector for China and American students

Folsom Library
The Richard G Folsom Library Folsom Library is a research library in the Rensselaer Research Libraries system constructed in the Brutalist style located on the campus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy NY It is named after Richard Gilman Folsom the President of the Institute from 19581971 The Folsom Library offers a variety of services to students and patrons of the library In addition to loans these services include class reserves general writing and presentation assistance through the Center for Communication Practices cultural and educational events interlibrary loans through ConnectNY individual and group room reservations computer labs and wireless internet

The library has integrated many electronic resources into its offering such as research databases and digital music libraries The library is also one of 1250 federal depository libraries in the United States and maintains an uptodate archive of thousands of federal documents open to the public Over 458260999 resources are available online or in the Folsom Library to faculty staff and researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute including over seven million books and eight million trade publications

The origins of the modern Folsom Library can be traced to the founding of the school in 1824 It was created in line with the Constitution and Laws of Rensselaer which stated that the school would have a very ample scientific library to which members of the institution will have free access At that time the Rensselaer School occupied The Old Bank Place in Troy and it is likely that the original library was only a single room or small part of a room The earliest librarian was a student named Albert Danker from the first graduating class and the collection consisted of a sparse number of scientific works

For a short period of time the library belonged to Amos Eaton a local scientist and educator He obtained rights to the Old Bank Place after the Rensselaer School changed its name to the Rensselaer Institute and moved to the nearby Van Der Heyden Mansion The school moved back to the Old Bank Place in the same year and upon Eatons death in 1842 regained ownership of the collection The library stayed under the ownership of Rensselaer when the institute was forced to move due to estate ownership complications to the Infant School a small brick building in downtown Troy

In 1862 sparks from a passing locomotive on the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad bridge caused a massive fire that wiped out a large portion of Troy and the majority of Rensselaers property Relocation and reconstruction began on 8th Street in Troy and in 1864 the library of 396 volumes moved into the Main Building where it would stay for another 30 years During that time an 80page catalog of the librarys collection entitled Catalogue of the Library of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy NY was published and it listed over 1000 titles spanning various technical areas From 1893 to 1927 the library moved several times finding home in the Alumni House on 2nd Street and later moving to the Pittsburgh Building and Amos Eaton Hall

Despite its growing collection in its early years the library was rarely used by students During the years of 1912 and 1913 when the library was located in the Pittsburgh Building there was considerably low utilization of the collection with many students only visiting the building in their Senior year to prepare for their graduation theses This was also partly due to the limited scope of the collection which by Rensselaers technical nature consisted primarily of technical journals and other periodicals

Student use increased during the period of 1912 to 1927 as the curriculum of the institute expanded and more volumes were added to the collection to supplement professors instruction It was also during this period of time that the library moved from the Pittsburgh Building to the more spacious Amos Eaton building The Amos Eaton building offered sufficient space for a little over 30 years until a growing number of publications written after World War II forced the collection to move again to the recently purchased St Joseph Convent chapel

The librarys continued growth forced the institute to take into consideration creating a dedicated building for holding its collection Up until 1950 the collection had been largely technical but expansion of the Humanities and Social Sciences as well as increased research created an intense demand on the library The library had constantly been moved from building to building up until this point never having had an actual home dedicated strictly for library usage To evaluate the possibility of a new location a Library Advisory Committee was formed The committee first published their discovery of numerous deficiencies in the current library in June 1962 in a report called Future of the RPI Library Collection The New York State Education Department also noted deficiencies of the library during their evaluation of the graduate program

On June 20 1967 the Library Advisory Committee published a report known as the Greene Report which detailed the purpose and requirements of a new library for the institute as well as previous research done about the librarys efficacy The report stated that The Library is the information center of the university providing resources to the scholars who are making doing and thinking things It went on to detail the primary functions of the library to be education and research and emphasized that the library must contain a strong collection in periodical literature go beyond books towards audio visual collections strengthen peripheral material availability and centralize all of the institutess collections The report also listed a number of other improvements including


At the time it was also clear that Rensselaer was lacking in its collection when compared to its peers In 1967 James E Skipper a researcher for the Association of Research Libraries compiled a table illustrating the collections of various universities in New York

The Greene Report made it clear that there was a need for a new library on campus and the next phase of the process began where the location of the library would be decided The institute hired Quinlivan Pierik  Krause an architecture firm centered in Syracuse to evaluate the campus and determine a possible location for the new library The firm recommended a location on the west side of campus adjacent to the librarys current location in the St Joseph Convent chapel

On October 23 1970 the firm requested a meeting with the president at the time Richard Folsom to discuss the possibility of a staged construction procedure where the facility would be built in iterations Each iteration would have an increasing amount of space The initial iteration with the existing chapel space would offer a total collection storage space of  Projections by the architect indicated that a total of would be available in 1985 followed by in 2010 The firm believed that this method of construction would allow expansion at a rate that the institute budget could accommodate

President Folsom presented the idea of a phased construction to the Library Advisory Committee who supported the idea but criticized it for its continued use of the chapel as well as placing the campus in a constant state of construction The committee also suggested considering one of the earlier potential locations close to the bleachers located on the 86 Field an athletic field at the center of the campus Professor Howard Litman the chairman of the committee at the time issued the statement In summary the most recent proposal for providing new facilities for the Rensselaer library is a workable but undesirable plan of development It will for the short term provide desperately needed space but in the long run yield an unexpectedly costly facility in the wrong place 

Beyond the concerns over how the library would be constructed questions still remained over where it would be built Dissent existed among the library committee over the location with those opposed to the western development arguing that a central location would be more convenient for students The architecture firm which had supported the western location for development issued a report emphasizing the benefits of building next to the chapel In the report listed several factors that made the site an optimal choice including the fact that distant observability of a building on this site is excellent

The report convinced 10 out of the 12 members of the Library Advisory Committee to support the site recommendation In 1971 the final decision was made to create a facility on the west side of campus The new library would have an underground annex and a pedestrian plaza that would connect it to St Josephs Chapel now the Voorhees Computing Center and would cost approximately 69 million

With the constant delay in construction many students had adopted an attitude of disdain towards the library As one student quoted in a report on the library There existed an attitude of the Library being a very second class function on campus expected to make do with inadequate housing and financial support and generally held in low self esteem 

Unfortunately there existed an additional delay one year after the decision was made on the location and size of the building In 1972 James C Andrews the Director of Libraries at the Institute at the time issued a report pointing out weaknesses in the recently reaffirmed proposal for construction In the report Andrews pointed out that the current location was far from the center of the campus and student dorms was closed in on three sides by existing buildings and that the size was not sufficient for the requirement decided by student and faculty surveying Knowing that there wasnt much that could be changed about the location at this point in the development process Andrews suggested several other improvements The Library Journal a magazine which discussed various designs for libraries around the country contained an article by Andrews in which he suggested the following changes


These improvements were taken into consideration in the ultimate design of the library and construction began 
The building had its dedication ceremony on May 15 1976 J Erik Jonsson an alumnus and trustee who had donated 2 million to get construction of the library started decided to name the library after the president of the institute who had initiated construction  Richard Folsom

In its discussion of the Folsom Library The Library Journal also includes data on the Folsom Library

After the initial pouring of concrete for Folsom Librarys floors it was noticed that the concrete contracted significantlyto the point that more concrete had to be poured in order to make the floors level and be able to properly install book stacks As a result the floors are slightly bowed According to college legend the contractor designed the foundation without knowing that it was to be a library A myth spread that persists to this day that Folsom Library is slowly sinking or slipping down the hill RPI students refer to this phenomenon which also applies to a few other buildings on campus as sliding down the hill into Troy However the notion of libraries sinking into the ground is not confined to the RPI campus other communities and colleges also report the same issues even though it was debunked by snopescom

 the Rensselaer Research Libraries contained 458260999 resources available online or in the library that include

The design of the Folsom Library has remained fairly static since its initial conception in June 1972 The concrete exterior that is in place is designed to complement the light gray brick of the nearby St Josephs Chapel

In 2005 the Folsom Library Renewal project was started The redesign a product of cooperation between an alumnus and Rensselaers Design and Construction group focused on creating a more welcoming space and improving the overall image of the building

        Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

        The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

        Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

        The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

        On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

        There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

        Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

        Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

        As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

        In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

        A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

        Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

        Marathon Rowing Championship
        The Marathon Rowing Championship is a continuous rowing regatta on the Cane River Lake in Natchitoches Louisiana Northwestern State University is the official host of the regatta The Marathon begins near the Melrose Plantation and ends at Front Street in Natchitoches The regatta is open to all sculling and sweepoar rowing boats On the day of the Marathon the Cane River is open only to competitors

        The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

        The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

        The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

        Pterodactyloidea
        Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

        Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

        In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

        Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

        A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

        There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
        Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

        14Butynediol
        14Butynediol is an organic compound that is an alkyne and a diol It is a colourless hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water and polar organic solvents It is a commercially significant compound in its own right and as a precursor to other products

        14Butynediol can be produced in the Reppe synthesis where formaldehyde and acetylene are the reactants

        Several patented production methods use copper bismuth catalysts coated on an inert material The normal temperature range for the reaction is 90C up to 150C depending on the pressure used for the reaction which can range from 1 to 20 bar

        14Butynediol is a precursor to 14butanediol and 2butene14diol by hydrogenation It is also used in the manufacture of certain herbicides textile additives corrosion inhibitors plasticizers synthetic resins and polyurethanes It is the major raw material used in the synthesis of vitamin B It is also used for brightening preserving and inhibiting nickel plating

        It reacts with a mixture of chlorine and hydrochloric acid to give mucochloric acid HOCCClCClCHO see mucobromic acid

        14Butynediol is corrosive and irritates the skin eyes and respiratory tract

        Fernando Castro Pacheco
        Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

        Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

        Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

        While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

        In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

        Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

        Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

        After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

        Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

        After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

        The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

        To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

        Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

        To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

        Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

        As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

        One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

        Nathalia Crane
        Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

        After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

        Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

        She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

        Texas State Highway Loop 150
        Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

        The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

        In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

        Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

    <doc id="7737240" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737240" title="Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate">
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

        In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

        The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

        Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

        The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

        Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

        Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

        In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

        This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

        When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

        In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

        In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

        In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

        Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

        The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

        There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

        In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

        As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

        As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

        On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release

        Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

        IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

        In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

        Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses

        To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

        Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

        Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

        NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

        Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

        An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

        The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

        Pleasant Plains New Jersey
        Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

        Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

        An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

        Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

        Since the early 19th century and possibly even earlier the area featured a oneroom schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Lairds Corner it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its oneroom schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools Moved across the road on log rollers it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development Instead it was moved to the Townships Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation

        The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area

        According to the United States Census Bureau Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3221 square miles 8342km including 3215 square miles 8328km of land and 0006 square miles 0014km of water 017

        The Pleasant Plains Cemetery located on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner was established in 1898

        Peristimulus time histogram
        In neurophysiology peristimulus time histogram and poststimulus time histogram both abbreviated PSTH or PST histogram are histograms of the times at which neurons fire It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram and poststimulus and peristimulus are often hyphenated

        The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

        To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram

        Oklahomas 2nd congressional district
        Oklahomas Second Congressional District is one of five United States Congressional districts in Oklahoma and covers approximately onefourth of the state in the east The district borders Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Texas and includes in whole or in part a total of 24 counties

        Historically the district has supported conservative Democrats and was reckoned as a classic Yellow Dog Democrat district However the growing Republican trend in the state has overtaken the district since the start of the 21st century In the last two elections the Republican presidential candidate has carried it by the largest margin in the state Urban voters represent a third of the district

        The district is represented by Republican Markwayne Mullin becoming only the second Republican after Tom Coburn to hold the seat since 1921

        The district borders Kansas to the north Missouri and Arkansas to the east and Texas along the Red River to the south It covers all or part of 26 counties It includes the remainder of Rogers County including the county seat of Claremore that is not included in the 1st District and then also all of the following counties Adair Nowata Craig Ottawa Mayes Delaware Cherokee Okmulgee Muskogee Sequoyah Okfuskee McIntosh Haskell LeFlore Hughes Pittsburg Latimer Coal Atoka Pushmataha McCurtain Choctaw Bryan Marshall and Johnston

        Some of the principal cities in the district include Miami Claremore Muskogee Tahlequah Okmulgee McAlester and Durant

        The northern half of the district includes most of the area of Oklahoma referred to as Green Country while the southern half of the district includes a part of Oklahoma often referred to as Little Dixie

        According to the 2000 US Census the district is 3551 percent urban 2395 percent nonwhite and has a population that is 240 percent Latino and 136 percent foreignborn The district has a higher percentage of Native Americans than any other congressional district in Oklahoma Its representative Markwayne Mullin is one of two Native Americans currently serving in Congress

        The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

        The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

        Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

        Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

        Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
        The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

        The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

        With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

        Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

        Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990

        One summer a boat named Castelo was stranded during the dry season and was not floated until the next rainy season
        The residents began to call the area Castelo
        In 1936 the residents asked the state government to make the settlement a town named after Manoel Urbano an Amazonian mestizo from the Manacapur region who had explored the Purus River
        In the territorial division of 31 December 1936 the region was the Castelo district of the Sena Madureira municipality
        On 1 March 1963 the municipality of Manoel Urbano was separated from Sena Madureira

        In the 2010 Census its population was 7981 divided between 5278 urban and 2703 rural
        As of 2010 the municipality ranked 5186 out of 5565 of Brazilian municipalities on the Human Development Index
        The overall index was 0551 Income was 0586 longevity was 0767 and education was 0373
        As of 1 July 2014 the estimated population was 8514

        Androgen replacement therapy
        Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

        ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

        Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

        The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

        Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

        The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

        On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

        There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

        Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

        Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

        As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

        In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

        A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

        Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

        The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

        The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

        The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

        Pterodactyloidea
        Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

        Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

        In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

        Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

        A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

        There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
        Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

        14Butynediol is an organic compound that is an alkyne and a diol It is a colourless hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water and polar organic solvents It is a commercially significant compound in its own right and as a precursor to other products

        14Butynediol can be produced in the Reppe synthesis where formaldehyde and acetylene are the reactants

        Several patented production methods use copper bismuth catalysts coated on an inert material The normal temperature range for the reaction is 90C up to 150C depending on the pressure used for the reaction which can range from 1 to 20 bar

        14Butynediol is a precursor to 14butanediol and 2butene14diol by hydrogenation It is also used in the manufacture of certain herbicides textile additives corrosion inhibitors plasticizers synthetic resins and polyurethanes It is the major raw material used in the synthesis of vitamin B It is also used for brightening preserving and inhibiting nickel plating

        It reacts with a mixture of chlorine and hydrochloric acid to give mucochloric acid HOCCClCClCHO see mucobromic acid

        14Butynediol is corrosive and irritates the skin eyes and respiratory tract

        Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

        Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

        While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

        In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

        Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

        Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

        After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

        Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

        After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

        The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

        To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

        Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

        To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

        Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

        As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

        One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

        Nathalia Crane
        Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

        After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

        Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

        She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

        Texas State Highway Loop 150
        Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

        The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

        In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

        Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

    <doc id="7737240" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737240" title="Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate">
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
        Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

        In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

        The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

        Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

        The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

        Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

        Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

        In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

        This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

        When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

        In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

        In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

        In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

        Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

        The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

        There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

        In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

        As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

        As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

        On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release

        Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

        IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

        In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

        Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses

        To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

        Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

        Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

        NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

        Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

        An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

        The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

        Pleasant Plains New Jersey
        Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

        Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

        An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

        Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

        Since the early 19th century and possibly even earlier the area featured a oneroom schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Lairds Corner it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its oneroom schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools Moved across the road on log rollers it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development Instead it was moved to the Townships Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation

        The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area

        According to the United States Census Bureau Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3221 square miles 8342km including 3215 square miles 8328km of land and 0006 square miles 0014km of water 017

        The Pleasant Plains Cemetery located on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner was established in 1898

        The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

        To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram


        The optimal bin size assuming an underlying Poisson point process  is a minimizer of the formula 2kv
        where k and v are mean and variance of k

        Oklahomas 2nd congressional district
        Oklahomas Second Congressional District is one of five United States Congressional districts in Oklahoma and covers approximately onefourth of the state in the east The district borders Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Texas and includes in whole or in part a total of 24 counties

        Historically the district has supported conservative Democrats and was reckoned as a classic Yellow Dog Democrat district However the growing Republican trend in the state has overtaken the district since the start of the 21st century In the last two elections the Republican presidential candidate has carried it by the largest margin in the state Urban voters represent a third of the district

        The district is represented by Republican Markwayne Mullin becoming only the second Republican after Tom Coburn to hold the seat since 1921

        The district borders Kansas to the north Missouri and Arkansas to the east and Texas along the Red River to the south It covers all or part of 26 counties It includes the remainder of Rogers County including the county seat of Claremore that is not included in the 1st District and then also all of the following counties Adair Nowata Craig Ottawa Mayes Delaware Cherokee Okmulgee Muskogee Sequoyah Okfuskee McIntosh Haskell LeFlore Hughes Pittsburg Latimer Coal Atoka Pushmataha McCurtain Choctaw Bryan Marshall and Johnston

        Some of the principal cities in the district include Miami Claremore Muskogee Tahlequah Okmulgee McAlester and Durant

        The northern half of the district includes most of the area of Oklahoma referred to as Green Country while the southern half of the district includes a part of Oklahoma often referred to as Little Dixie

        According to the 2000 US Census the district is 3551 percent urban 2395 percent nonwhite and has a population that is 240 percent Latino and 136 percent foreignborn The district has a higher percentage of Native Americans than any other congressional district in Oklahoma Its representative Markwayne Mullin is one of two Native Americans currently serving in Congress

        The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

        The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

        Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

        Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

        Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
        The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

        The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

        With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

        Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

        Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990

    <doc id="7737010" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7737010" title="Androgen replacement therapy">
        Androgen replacement therapy
        Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

        ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

        Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

        The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

        Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

        The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

        On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

        There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

        Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

        Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

        As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

        In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

        A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

        Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

        The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

        The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

        The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

        Pterodactyloidea
        Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

        Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

        In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known

        Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

        A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

        There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
        Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

        14Butynediol
        14Butynediol is an organic compound that is an alkyne and a diol It is a colourless hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water and polar organic solvents It is a commercially significant compound in its own right and as a precursor to other products

        14Butynediol can be produced in the Reppe synthesis where formaldehyde and acetylene are the reactants

        Several patented production methods use copper bismuth catalysts coated on an inert material The normal temperature range for the reaction is 90C up to 150C depending on the pressure used for the reaction which can range from 1 to 20 bar

        14Butynediol is a precursor to 14butanediol and 2butene14diol by hydrogenation It is also used in the manufacture of certain herbicides textile additives corrosion inhibitors plasticizers synthetic resins and polyurethanes It is the major raw material used in the synthesis of vitamin B It is also used for brightening preserving and inhibiting nickel plating

        It reacts with a mixture of chlorine and hydrochloric acid to give mucochloric acid HOCCClCClCHO see mucobromic acid

        14Butynediol is corrosive and irritates the skin eyes and respiratory tract

        Fernando Castro Pacheco
        Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

        Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

        Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

        While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

        In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

        Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

        Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

        After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

        Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

        After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

        The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

        To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

        Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

        To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

        Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

        As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

        One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

        Nathalia Crane
        Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

        After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind

        Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

        She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

        Texas State Highway Loop 150
        Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

        The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71

        In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

        Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95
