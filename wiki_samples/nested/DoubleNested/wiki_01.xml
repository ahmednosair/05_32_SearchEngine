        Source routing
        In computer networking source routing also called path addressing allows a sender of a packet to partially or
        completely specify the route the packet takes through the network In contrast in conventional routing routers in
        the network determine the path incrementally based on the packets destination Another routing alternative label
        switching is used in connectionoriented networks such as X25 frame relay ATM and MPLS

        Source routing allows easier troubleshooting improved traceroute and enables a node to discover all the possible
        routes to a host It does not allow a source to directly manage network performance by forcing packets to travel
        over one path to prevent congestion on another

        Many highperformance interconnects including Myrinet Quadrics IEEE 1355 and SpaceWire support source routing

        In the Internet Protocol two header options are available which are rarely used strict source and record route
        SSRR and loose source and record route LSRR Because of security concerns packets marked LSRR are frequently
        blocked on the Internet If not blocked LSRR can allow an attacker to spoof its address but still successfully
        receive response packets

        In IPv6 two forms of source routing have been developed The first approach was the Type 0 Routing header This
        routing header was designed to support the same use cases as the IPv4 header options Unfortunately there were
        several important attacks against this routing header and its utilisation was deprecated A more secure form of
        source routing is being developed within the IETF to support the IPv6 version of Segment Routing

        Softwaredefined networking can also be enhanced when source routing is used in the forwarding plane Studies have
        shown significant improvements in convergence times as a result of the reduced state that must be distributed by
        the controller into the network

        When using source routing with Myrinet the sender of the packet prepends the complete route one byte for every
        crossbar to each packet header
        Each crossbar examines the first routing byte of the packet
        When using source routing that byte indicates a particular port of that crossbar when that port becomes
        available the router discards that routing byte and sends the rest of the packet out that port

        Each packet traveling through a SpaceWire network can use path addressing source routing or logical addressing
        or some combination
        The router examines the first data character of the packet when it indicates some specific port of the router
        the router discards that routing character and sends the rest of the packet out that port

        Sauce Amricaine
        Sauce amricaine is a recipe from classic French cookery containing chopped onions tomatoes white wine brandy
        salt cayenne pepper butter and fish stock It is sometimes known as sauce armoricaine which is the original name
        derived from Armorica the ancient name for a region of France including Brittany which is known for its fishing

        Louis Saulnier gives the following recipe

        Amricaine Treat as for Lobster Amricaine Pound shells and meat in the mortar and incorporate equal quantity of
        fish velout add butter

        As with many other classic dishes the original recipe has been adapted over time and almost every chef will
        prepare the sauce in a slightly different way Modern recipes usually include tarragon will use lobster stock
        rather than pounded lobster and often replace cayenne pepper with paprika

        SaturnShuttle
        The SaturnShuttle was a preliminary concept of launching the Space Shuttle orbiter using the Saturn V rocket It
        was studied and considered in 19711972

        An interstage would be fitted on top of the SIC stage to support the external tank in the space occupied by the
        SII stage in the Saturn V It was an alternative to the SRBs

        The addition of wings and some form of landing gear on the SIC stage would allow the booster to fly back to the
        Kennedy Space Center where technicians would then refurbish the booster by replacing only the five F1 engines
        and reusing the tanks and other hardware for later flights

        The Shuttle would handle space station logistics while Saturn V would launch components
        This would have allowed a space station using a Skylab or Mir configuration with docking ports to have been
        lifted with just a handful of launches The SaturnShuttle concept also would have eliminated the Space Shuttle
        Solid Rocket Boosters that ultimately precipitated the Space Shuttle Challenger accident in 1986

        Because the shuttle orbiter would be riding piggyback on the external tank and the need to prevent damage to the
        delicate thermal protection tiles the fiveengine variant of the SaturnShuttle would require the center engine to
        be shut down 45 to 50 seconds after launch while two of the outboard engines would have to be shut down prior to
        staging Once the SIC was jettisoned the three onboard highenergy Space Shuttle main engines would then propel
        the orbiter into LEO shutting down 65 minutes after ignition The external tank would then be jettisoned as on
        the actually flown shuttle configuration and the orbiter would then perform its mission

        But because of the need to keep costs down and to allow President Richard Nixon to approve the shuttle program
        in 1972 NASA decided to utilize segmented solid rocket boosters similar to those used on the Titan III rocket
        instead of the SIC thus ending the Saturn program after the initial Saturn V order was completed

        Westminster Christian Academy WCA is a K12 private college preparatory Christian school Its campus is located at
        1640 New High Shoals Road in Watkinsville Oconee County Georgia United States

        Westminster Christian Academy was founded in the fall of 1988
        The schools initial class was composed of 10 first second and third grade students meeting in rented space at
        Faith Presbyterian Church in Watkinsville taught by Karen Schaefer The school grew alongside the oldest students
        in this first class adding a new grade level after each school year

        In 1994 enrollment in the school outgrew the capacity of its facilities at Faith Presbyterian As a result the
        schools lower grades K4 remained at Faith and the higher grades 58 the highest grade offered at the time moved
        to facilities at Watkinsville First Baptist Church WCAs first high school class graduated in the spring of 1999

        The school completed the first phase of development at its present location a site in Oconee County in the fall
        of 1998 An additional expansion has been planned that would add a new gymnasium and bring the schools capacity
        to 500 students

        The school enrolled 270 students across all grades for the 20112012 academic year

        WCAs facilities include an administration building which also houses the library a lowerschool building which
        houses PreK through fifth grade an upperschool building with a gymnasium and a fitness center which houses the
        middle grades and Westminster High School a field house containing two class rooms and three athletic fields The
        gymnasium houses ten classrooms

        Uniforms are required on four out of five days for middle through high school on casual Friday students can wear
        nontorn jeans and Tshirts A chapel is held every Thursday at separate times for K5 and 612 where all students
        sing and listen to a guest speaker

        WCA is accredited by the Georgia Accrediting Commission and has a dual accreditation with the Southern
        Association of Independent Schools and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools

        WCAs athletics teams compete in Region 1A of the Georgia Independent School Association The school sponsors
        teams in the following sports

        The school claims that nearly 75 of the student body participates in an officially sanctioned sport

        Northgate Mall San Rafael
        Northgate Mall is a shopping mall located in San Rafael California north of the Golden Gate Bridge Its the
        largest of three shopping centers in San Rafael called Northgate It is managed by The Macerich Company It is the
        only enclosed regional shopping center in Marin County The malls anchors are Macys and Kohls with a vacant
        anchor last occupied by Sears It also contains a Century Theatres multiplex a food court and more than 90
        specialty stores services and restaurants

        The original anchor in the corner occupied by Macys was The Emporium which opened in 1964 When the rest of the
        mall opened in 1965 it had an openair design The mall was enclosed when it was renovated in 1987

        MTR Properties Inc was the original owner Macerich bought the mall in 1985 before selling it to Merlone Geier
        Partners in 2017

        On January 4 2018 Sears announced that its store at the mall will be closing as part of a plan to close 103
        stores nationwide The store closed in April 2018 Around the same time plans were announced that would transform
        the mall into a town center

        Macerich began renovating the mall in 2008 The proposed renovation has been controversial as housing advocates
        have pushed for inclusion of affordable housing in the project to replace the aging housing in the Canal Area
        while Macerich chose to proceed without triggering a fullscale environmental review

        Relational dialectics
        Relational dialectics is an interpersonal communication theory about close personal ties and relationships that
        highlights the tensions struggles and interplay between contrary tendencies The theory proposed respectively by
        Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery in 1988 defines communication patterns between relationship partners as the
        result of endemic dialectical tensions

        Relationships are made in dialogue and they can be complicated and dialogue with similarities and differences
        are necessary Relational communication theories allow for opposing views or forces to come together in a
        reasonable way When making decisions desires and viewpoints that often contradict one another are mentioned and
        lead to dialectical tensions Leslie A Baxter and Barbara M Montgomery exemplify these contradictory statements
        that arise from individuals experience dialectal tensions using common proverbs such as opposites attract but
        birds of a feather flock together as well as twos company threes a crowd but the more the merrier This does not
        mean these opposing tensions are fundamentally troublesome for the relationship on the contrary they simply
        bring forward a discussion of the connection between two parties

        The relational dialectic is an elaboration on Mikhail Bakhtins idea that life is an open monologue and humans
        experience collisions between opposing desires and needs within relational communications Baxter includes a list
        of dialectical tensions that reminds us that relationships are constantly changing and that successful and
        satisfying relationships require constant attention Although Baxters description of relational dialectics is
        thorough it is not exact or all inclusive since we all experience different tensions in different ways

        Relational dialectics is the emotional and valuebased version of the philosophical dialectic It is rooted in the
        dynamism of the yin and yang Like the classic yin and yang the balance of emotional values in a relationship is
        constantly in motion and any value pushed to its extreme contains the seed of its opposite

        In the Western world the ideas of ying and yang link back to the Greek philosopher Heraclitus who argued that
        the world was in constant flux like fire with creative and destructive forces on both sides of every process
        Mikhail Bakhtin a Russian scholar most known for his work in dialogism applied Marxist dialectic to literary and
        rhetorical theory and criticism He illustrated the tensions that exists in the deep structure of all human
        experience For example he identified that the tension that exists between unity and difference Bakhtin conceived
        the human dialectic as two forces analogous to the physical forces centripetal emotional forces tending towards
        unity and centrifugal emotional forces tending towards divergence Like the Yin and Yang Bakhtins forces have no
        ultimate resolution

        Baxter took the deep structural analysis of Bakhtin and applied it to communication theory She found a TBangha
        of axes where this dynamic tension operated Later authors have added other axes

        There are three main approaches to relational dialectics monologic dualistic and dialectic br

        The first approach monologic approach frames contradictions as eitheror demonstrating that the contradictions
        are mutually exclusive or opposite of each other For example an individual can either like hot or cold weather
        They may not like not a mix of the weather conditions Monologic approach means as we move closer to one concept
        we move further away from the other br

        The second approach dualistic approach frames contradictions as two separate entities showing that they are
        unrelated in nature When studying a relationship and one individual in the relationship is evaluated exclusive
        of his or her interaction with their partner then this is an example of dualistic approach br

        The third approach the dialectic approach contends that multiple points of view play off one another in every
        contradiction bothand When two people are in a relationship one can desire to be open in the relationship
        exposing certain parts of his or her life with the other person At the same time that individual can also have a
        sense of selfprotection where they may not want to share everything about them with their partner Both of these
        feelings can exist within the individual at the same time

        There are four main concepts that form the backdrop of relational dialectics as well as four major assumptions
        Relational dialectics assumes that 1 relationships are not linear 2 relational life is characterized by change 3
        contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life and 4 communication is central to organizing and
        negotiating relational contradictions

        The four core concepts of relational dialectics include contradiction totality process and praxis

        Contradictions are the core concept of relational dialectics It is the dynamic interplay between unified
        oppositions A contradiction is formed whenever two tendencies or forces are interdependent unity yet mutually
        negate one another negation For example in a relationship one can simultaneously desire intimacy and distance

        Totality suggests that contradictions in a relationship are part of a unified whole and cannot be understood in
        isolation In other words the dialectics cannot be separated and are intrinsically related to each other For
        example the tension between dependence and interdependence cannot be separated from the tension between openness
        and privacy both work to condition and define the other

        Process Relational dialectics must be understood in terms of social processes Movement activity and change are
        functional properties Rawlins1989 For example instances such as an individual fluctuating between disclosure and
        secretiveness In addition the individual may move between periods of honest and open communication Miller 2002
        2005

        Praxis is a philosophical term for the concept of practical behavior or sometimes the experience of practicing
        In praxis the dialectic tensions are created and recreated through the active participation and interaction In
        other words the practical experience of having a relationship exposes one to the imposition of the needs and
        values of another As the relationship endures ones own needs and values become apparent Praxis focuses on the
        practical choices individuals make in the midst of the opposing needs and values dialectical tensions In turn
        the choices and actions themselves create recreate and change the nature of the relationship and hence the
        dialectical tensions themselves

        Research has recommended theories which further dialectical understanding in relationships such as in marriage
        in the workplace etc Relational dialectics further includes the idea of Contextual Dialectics or rather the idea
        that every relationship exists within a specific place within a specific culture From there we also see the
        raise of public and privatereal and ideal dialectics and the interplay between what is seen on television in
        public life versus what is experienced in private lives Examples of this concept include the viewing of
        politicians as well as what is viewed on television shows According to West and Turner the tension of the real
        and ideal dialectic is featured when we think of television shows like Leave It to Beaver We receive an
        idealized message of what family life is like and then when we look at the families we live in we have to
        contend with the troublesome realities of family life The tension between these two images forms this dialectic

        According to the original relational dialectic model there were many core tensions opposing values in any
        relationship These are autonomy and connectedness favoritism and impartiality openness and closedness novelty
        and predictability instrumentality and affection and finally equality and inequality

        Autonomy and connectedness refers to the desire to have ties and connections with others versus the need to
        separate oneself as a unique individual An example of autonomy and connectedness would be an athlete who wants
        to feel like heshe is a part of a team but also wanting to highlight hisher individual talents Favoritism and
        impartiality refers to the desire to be treated fairly and impartially versus the desire to be seen and known as
        special For instance a professor may want to be impartial by creating an attendance policy but makes exceptions
        for students who participate in class and have good grades demonstrating favoritism Openness and closedness
        refers to the desire to be open and divulge information versus the desire to be exclusive and private When
        chatting with a boss about ones weekend there is the desire to be open however closedness is also at play as
        certain details are often left out because of the context Novelty and predictability suggest that there is a
        desire for the relationship to be predictable versus the desire for it to be original and new When creating
        scheduled meetings for board members the predictability may lie in a fixed schedule however the novelty may be
        in scheduling a varying number of locations to peak interests as well as inspiration Instrumentality and
        affection is the desire for affection to be genuine versus the desire for affection to be motivated by benefits
        and perceived advantages of the relationship An example of this would be being in a romantic relationship based
        on love and affection but maintaining it for benefits such as financial security Finally equality and inequality
        refers to the desire to be considered as equals versus the desire to develop levels of superiority A female in
        the military may seek treatment equivalent to that received by her male colleagues but requires special barracks
        and adjusted assignments

        According to the theory while most of us may embrace the ideals of closeness certainty and openness in our
        relationships the communication is not a straight path towards these goals Conflicts often produce the exact
        opposites

        The table above shows typical dialectical tensions experienced by relational partners based on research done by
        Baxter and Montgomery showing contrasting efforts in two different ways The column that displays examples of
        Internal Dialect shows ongoing tensions played out within a relationship The column that displays examples of
        External Dialect shows ongoing tensions between a couple and their community

        Integrationseparation is a class of relational dialectics that includes connectionautonomy inclusionseclusion
        and intimacyindependence Some individual autonomy must be given up to connect to others

        Stabilitychange is a class of relational dialectics that includes certaintyuncertainty conventionallyuniqueness
        predictabilitysurprise and routinenovelty Things must be consistent but not mundane There must be a balance
        between the expected and unexpected in order to keep a relationship

        Expressionnonexpression is a class of relational dialectics that includes opennessclosedness
        revelationconcealment candorsecrecy and transparencyprivacy In a relationship it is important to keep some
        things between the two parties while other parts of the relationship are okay to allow the public to know about

        According to Michaela Meyer relational dialectics theory exposes tensions within interpersonal relationships
        while at the same time it assumes a continual maintenance and repair of these tensions As a result relational
        dialectics theory is incredibly useful for defining how tensions are managed within relationships Extensive
        research has been done regarding the role dialectical tensions play in relationships as well as the various
        factors that influence the tensions and the degree to which they affect the relationship Through studies of
        romantic relationships long distance relationships friendships and family relationships researchers have
        observed the existence and frequency of certain dialectical tensions within various types of relationships

        According to Marsha Linehan founder of DBT or Dialectical Behavior Therapy some people have great difficulty
        resolving the dialectic tensions that arise in relationships Many people with personality disorders potentially
        caused or made worse by dysfunctional upbringing especially Borderline Personality Disorder BPD and some others
        perpetually vascilate between the poles of the dialectic conflict with resulting instability causing problems in
        living that are not mediated by other therapy modalities In DBTs biosocial theory some people have a biological
        predisposition for emotional dysregulation and their social environment validates maladaptive behavior

        A study of 25 heterosexual married couples was designed to determine what types of dialectical tensions were
        most prevalent in antagonistic conflicts between spouses Larry Erbert found that the Openness v Closedness
        dialectic was most commonly referenced through examples by participants Research conducted by Baxter and
        Montgomery confirmed this finding and broke the dialectic down into four subcategories to further analyze its
        existence in romantic relationships


        Research has been conducted to examine the autonomyconnection dialectic when dealing with termination of
        romantic relationships In Erin Sahlestein and Tim Duns study they found that participants joint conversations
        and their breakup accounts reflect the two basic forms of contradiction Both antagonistic and nonantagonistic
        struggles were evident in these data Furthermore the study discovered that while normally breakups are
        retroactively studied the autonomyconnection dialectic is actually in full swing throughout the termination
        process as opposed to previous thought of as a move from connection to autonomy

        A study measuring the display of symbols by lesbian couples revealed that while samesex couples experience
        similar challenges that oppositesex partners experience there are unique challenges that arise to these samesex
        couples These unique problems in turn give rise to unique dialectical tensions within the relationship

        In a study that focused on dialectics in second marriages six tensions unique to remarriages emerged

        Three tensions related to the remarried dyad


        Three tensions also emerged from the remarried dyad and their social networks


        Based on research by Sahlstein the uncertainty v certainty dialectic is the most prevailing dialectic found in
        longdistance relationships Her work exposed uncertainty v certainty as a competing yet complementary need In
        interviews conducted with couples engaged in long distance relationships contradictions emerged For example
        couples were found to plan interactions in order to obtain a level of spontaneity Within this three different
        forms of the praxis of relational dialectics emerged

        William Rawlins has examined the role of relational dialectics in regard to friendships The tension of
        instrumentality v affection was found to be the most central to this type of relationship Within friendships
        importance is placed on the ability to discern the level of affection for real friendships opposed to
        instrumentality for fake friendships Aristotles friendship of virtue notion of caring for friends without
        instrumental purposes exemplifies this point The dichotomy of instrumentality v affection cannot be ignored
        within friendships as affection may be offered in order to receive instrumental aid from friends This
        interweaving of concepts is what distinguishes different types of friendships While this remains true the
        subjectivity of the friends in question ultimately determines the outcome of how heavily instrumentality v
        affection is applied

        In the workplace

        Blended Relationships are close friends that are a part of the same work environment Dialectical tensions occur
        in organizations as individuals attempt to balance their roles as employees while maintaining established
        friendships within their occupations It is not necessary however to have a friend in organizations to experience
        dialectical contradictions Stress occurs frequently on the individual level as human needs and desires oppose
        Sibling relationships

        Relational dialectics can be applied when considering the significant change in family life that siblings
        experience when one sibling moves out of the family home for the first time as part of the transition into
        adulthood As one sibling begins a new phase of life this change is often accompanied by new friendships or
        romantic relationships that occur in hisher new lifestyle along with a new geographic separation both of which
        result in a change in communication As the newly absent sibling begins a new lifestyle beyond hisher home the
        preexisting sibling relationship goes through various changes and transitions

        In a study conducted on discursive struggles among siblings experiencing transition all participants
        acknowledged that moving away from their siblings resulted in a discursive struggle between the old and new
        meanings in the sibling relationship Two specific discursive struggles were identified

        While participants addressed the varying tensions involved with lifestyle transitions 8 of the 19 participants
        in the study expressed that moving away from their sibling strengthened their connection and appreciation for
        their brothers andor sisters

        In a study focusing on the adult stepchild perceptions of communication in the stepchildstepparent relationship
        three contradictions were found to be experienced by the stepchildren participants

        In another study researchers aimed to identify the contradictions that were perceived by stepchildren when
        characterizing the ways that familial interactions caused them to feel caught in the middle between parents The
        participants expressed that they wanted to be centered in the family while at the same time they hoped to avoid
        being caught in the middle of two opposing parents The main contradiction identified in the study was similar to
        the autonomyconnection dialectic stepchildren desired the freedom to communicate and enact the desired
        relationship with their parents However these stepchildren also felt the need to manage the constraints that
        resulted from parental communication particularly when both parents did not cooperate with one another While the
        stepchildren wanted to know what was happening at the same time they also wanted to be protected resulting in a
        second dialectic of controlrestraint Through this study the researchers believe that opennesscloseness dialectic
        between parents and their children is important to building functional stepfamily relationships

        One study focused on the relationship and communication between collegeaged stepchildren and their
        nonresidential parents found two underlying contradictions parenting and not parenting and openness and
        closeness Many participants expressed that they wanted their nonresidential parent to be actively involved in
        parenting them but did not desire it once they were Participants also expressed that while they wanted open and
        intimate communication with their nonresidential parents they felt that they could not closely communicate
        because of the nonresidential parents lack of familiarity with the childs everyday life

        Relational dialectics theory can be applied to the context of health care specifically endoflife care providing
        a system for caregiver communication that contains tensions and challenges The quality of the endoflife journey
        is influenced by how these tensions are managed Relational dialectics theory is an applicable framework for
        investigating the ongoing communication between physicians and their patientsfamily members during the process
        of endoflife care

        When making choices about endoflife medical care family members friends or surrogate decision makers often
        experience feelings of tension and burden Decisionmakers must deal with the relational and moral tensions that
        come with such decisionmaking Family members in charge of making endoflife decisions often face conflicting
        emotions between holding on and letting go recognizing the need to let a patient go while wanting to continue
        fighting to keep a loved one alive

        In a study that focused on the communication tensions perceived among the Maori culture during the endoflife
        journey it was found that despite the cultures focus on collectivism and its emphasis on harmony four
        communication tensions existed between caregivers family and friends and patients autonomy and connection
        conflict and connection isolation and connection and balancing the needs of self and other

        The human grieving process is marked by relational dialectics After the death of a child bereaved parents often
        experience tension between presence and absence by grieving their childs permanent absence while still
        experiencing an emotional bond toward the deceased child Bereaved parents may also experience tension between
        openness and closeness where they desire to discuss their feelings with friends or family yet they are hesitant
        to share because of the potentially negative reactions they could receive

        One study aimed at focusing on how families make sense of contradictory discourses found two discursive
        contradictions family members wishes vs patients wishes and emotionality vs rationality Through interviews with
        participants who had experienced the loss of a loved one researchers concluded that many of the end of life
        decisions made by family members patients and doctors were centered on making sense of the simultaneous desires
        to hold on and to let go Participants recognized that they experienced tension between their own preferences and
        the preferences of a loved one and with that experienced the tension between desiring to make decisions based on
        emotions versus making decisions based on rationality

        Dialectical contradictions have also been found among parents who have lost a child One study found that two
        primary dialectical contradictions occurred for parents who had experienced the death of a child
        opennesscloseness and presenceabsence Parents experienced opennesscloseness when they desired to talk about
        their child and their loss yet they perceived the outcome as risky especially if they sensed that friends and
        family wished for the parents to move on Participants explained that they were able to manage this contradiction
        by being selective with their disclosure and taking control over the communicative situation When dealing with
        the presenceabsence dialectic bereaved parents experienced tensions between the ongoing bond that they
        experienced with their child and the physical absence of the child Participants expressed that when people were
        not willing to remember their dead child the physical absence of the child was deeply felt However when people
        chose to remember the deceased child the parent experienced feelings of comfort and continual bonding with the
        child

        Understanding Autistic Communication

        As relational dialects aim is to analyse competence during interaction it can suggest an approach to researching
        on communication competence among people which are with autism spectrum disorders Applying relational dialects
        theory to studying interactions of autistic individuals starts from approaching autistic individual as an actor
        during the interaction and deeming competence a result of the interaction This approach can delve into how
        social contexts expectations and roles contribute to the autistics competent communication The investigation of
        dialects includes integrationseparation expressionprivacy and stabilitychange enhance the understanding of the
        communication between people with autism spectrum disorders

        Dialogue is typically a conversation between two or more people These conversations are what constitute
        relationships as communication is the very foundation of any relationship According to Cools the four important
        concepts that form the foundation of dialogism 1 the self and the other situated in contradictory forces 2
        unfinalizability 3 the chronotope and the carnivalesque and 4 heteroglossia and utterance Similarity in dialogue
        the following components are the most important constitutive dialogue utterance chains dialectical flux
        aesthetic moment and critical sensibility

        Constitutive dialogue

        While some theorists along with Baxter may argue that communication is simply a feature in a relationship
        examining constitutive dialogue suggests that communication is actually what creates and maintains a
        relationship instead According to Baxter a constitutive approach to communication asks how communication defines
        or constructs the social world including our selves and our personal relationships From a constitutive
        perspective then persons and relationships are not analytically separable from communication instead
        communication constitutes these phenomena When initial researchers studied relationships they found that
        similarities backgrounds and interests are usually what hold people together while selfdisclosure is the root of
        these components Dialogic researchers would argue that differences are just as important as similarities and
        they are both discovered through dialogue

        Utterance chains

        To understand utterance chains we must know that an utterance is what a person says in one turn of a
        conversation When utterances are linked to competing discourses they are considered utterance chains Baxter
        believes that there are four links on the chain where the struggle of competing discourses can be heard These
        are cultural ideologies relational history nonyet spoken response of partner or utterance and normative
        evaluation of third party to utterance Baxter also suggest that to understand an utterance we must also
        understand the discourse She posits in the broadest sense a discourse is a cultural system of meaning that
        circulates among a groups members and which makes our talk sensical for example in the United States the
        discourse of individualism helps us to understand and value an utterance such as I need to find myself first
        before I commit to a serious relationship with another person

        Dialectical flux

        A dialectical flux is the unpredictable unfinalizable indeterminate nature of personal relationships
        Relationships are complicated and intertwined with dialectical tensions Spiraling inversion and segmentation are
        two strategies that Baxter and Montgomery have established to respond to this complexity Spiraling inversion is
        generally a nowin situation a struggle between two different thought processes For example if you were to do
        something your parents did not approve of you could lie about it but your parents might yell at you for lying
        And on the other hand you could tell them upfront and they could be completely quiet in shock Segmentation is
        pertaining to more than one role in a relationship that must be altered depending on the situation For example
        if you were working at your fathers shop as a parttime job he would be considered your father AND your boss This
        could mean that he has different expectations of you in different circumstances and his attitude towards you
        might change between roles

        Aesthetic moment

        Aesthetic moments are brief incidents in a relationship that bring participants together through the use of
        dialogue There is a temporary feeling of wholeness felt between partners involved in this dialogue It is easy to
        see examples of aesthetic moments in romantic relationships such as a first kiss or a reciting of wedding vows
        but these moments can be experienced by anyone

        Critical sensibility

        According to Griffin critical sensibility is an obligation to critique dominant voices especially those that
        suppress opposing viewpoints a responsibility to advocate for those who are muted This means that both sides of
        a dialogue are equal to one another No one person is more powerful or dominant than the other and they are able
        to communicate without these imbalances interfering This does not mean that the dialogue is free of competing
        discourses as listed in Utterance Chains

        When communicating we must understand that morals do not apply for all people Sometimes lying can be entirely
        minor in communication but there are oftentimes that lying can majorly affect the perspective of those being
        lied to There are several times where most people would justify a white lie or a lie that causes no harm For
        instance if your mother was in the hospital you could tell her she still looked beautiful even if her appearance
        was far from it because it would make her feel better Other actions that are only followed through based on
        whether they have a positive or negative outcome are called consequential ethics According to Sissela Bok lies
        drag around an initial negative weight that must be factored into ethical equations Bok believes in the
        principle of veracity which says that truthful statements are preferable to lies in the absence of special
        circumstances that overcome the negative weight Ethics plays a major role in the study of interpersonal
        communication particularly relational dialectics In an area where contradictions seem like the norm it is even
        more important to share the truth Incorporating varying and often times opposite view points is critical because
        communication is grounded in human nature which forces ethics

        According to theorist Leslie Baxter there are three major limitations in the work of relational dialectics
        theory Baxter claims that her work has been too distanced from naturally occurring talk between relating parties
        and claims that the theory needs a firmer empirical base when applied to talk between relating parties Naturally
        occurring talk between relating parties could be qualitative work utilizing the observation method of relating
        parties or small groups Nonparticipative or participative observation would be appropriate for continued study
        of relational dialectics theory Baxter also believes that more future work needs to include multiple voices
        instead of focusing on the more popular research on the dialectics between two voices Baxter posits that
        relational dialectics opposite infers binary opposites when many discourses can be competing at once Lastly
        Baxter shares that future research should focus on discourse through time such as studying dialogue and how it
        transforms over a longer period of time The latter would take significant time so it would be studies that
        incorporate earlier works compared to more recent work

        WVAR
        WVAR is an radio station located in Richwood West Virginia that plays a classic hits format

        The station also carries West Virginia University basketball and Richwood High School sports While it simulcasts
        sister station WSGB fulltime WVAR breaks away for sports broadcasts

        WVAR first went on the air on November 16 1957 and first broadcast at 1280 AM under the call letters WMNF The
        original owner was Royal Broadcasting Company of which Herman Dotson served as president and Art Grunewald as
        general manager Studios were located along Cemetery Road in Richwood By 1959 the call letters were changed to
        WVAR as they remain today

        On January 1 1965 WVAR was sold to R S Broadcasting Carl Gainer was the new company president and Virgil Graves
        became General Manager In 1968 WVAR moved from its dial position of 1280kHz to 600kHz The station retained its
        daytimeonly broadcast hours and output power of 1000 watts

        In 1991 WVAR moved its studios and offices to 713 Main Street in Summersville but would maintain a local
        presence in Richwood at 2 Rhododendron Drive formerly known as Cemetery Road On December 24 1996 after more than
        30 years of ownership WVAR was sold by R S Broadcasting to J K Broadcasting The ownership change also resulted
        in the pairing of an FM sister station WAFD which had gone on the air earlier that year with a southern and
        country gospel format

        In midFebruary 2003 an ice storm that ravaged the southern part of West Virginia toppled the WVAR broadcasting
        antenna atop Hinkle Mountain which overlooks Richwood In the following summer the station and its owner raised
        funds to erect a new antenna The station was closed with a dark license while funds were sought to replace it

        On March 13 2007 J K Broadcasting Inc sold WVAR to Summit Media Broadcasting LLC for 124 million in a
        transaction that included sister FM station WAFD in Webster Springs Summit Media also owns WDBSFM and WSGBAM
        Studios were moved to 202 Back Fork Street in Webster Springs

        On May 15 2007 WVAR dropped its country format and began simulcasting sister WSGBAMs oldies format as The Mighty
        1490 That October Summit Media filed an application with the FCC to waive main studio requirements for WVAR
        which would allow onair operations to be colocated with WSGB and other stations in Summit Medias ownership group

        Two months later another application was filed informing the FCC that Summit Media had taken the station silent
        due to Summit Medias inability to successfully meet FCCrequired staffing needs at the Webster Springs studio The
        FCC granted the application to keep the station silent in January 2008 until granting permission for the studio
        waiver later that year However Summit Media kept the station silent for another year due to technical
        renovations being delayed due to the lack of available workforce

        In November 2009 Summit Media filed an application to rebroadcast WVARs signal over FM translator W251AY
        licensed to Birch River The translator licensed to operate at 981 mHz broadcasts at 250 watts at a height of 256
        m above average terrain The translator which has been on the air since 2004 had been previously used to
        rebroadcast the signal of sister FM station WDBS

        Oboe Concerto Marcello
        The Oboe Concerto in Dminor SD935 is an early 18thcentury concerto for oboe strings and continuo attributed to
        the Venetian composer Alessandro Marcello The earliest extant manuscript containing Johann Sebastian Bachs solo
        keyboard arrangement of the concerto BWV974 dates from around 1715 As a concerto for oboe strings and continuo
        its oldest extant sources date from 1717 that year it was printed in Amsterdam and a Cminor variant of the
        concerto SZ799 was written down

        Bachs keyboard version was published as an arrangement of a concerto by Antonio Vivaldi in the 19th century In
        1923 the Cminor version of the oboe concerto was published as a composition by Benedetto Marcello Alessandros
        brother In the second half of the 20th century several publications indicated Alessandro again as the composer
        of the piece as it had been in its early 18thcentury print and the oboe concerto was again published in its
        Dminor version

        As well oboe concerto versions and versions based on Bachs arrangement kept repertoire in the 20th and 21st
        century

        The Concerto in Dminor SD935 was published by Jeanne Roger in Amsterdam in 1717 as a Concerto a Cinque concerto
        in five parts for oboe soloist strings two violin and one viola parts and continuo composed by Alessandro
        Marcello No publication date appears in the print although the year of publication is depending on author
        sometimes given as ca 17141717 or 1716 it can be inferred from the consecutive testaments of the publishers
        father Estienne Roger and from the sequence of publication numbers The publication presents the melody lines
        unadorned that is it is left to the performing musician to embellish melodies with ornaments such as trills
        mordents and grace notes Alessandro Marcello published most of his works under a pseudonym Eterio Stinfalico the
        oboe concerto publication was an exception in that sense as it used his real name

        In his Weimar period 170817 Johann Sebastian Bach arranged several concertos by Venetian composers most of them
        by Antonio Vivaldi for solo keyboard In July 1713 Prince Johann Ernst returned to Weimar from the Netherlands
        with several compositions by Italian masters Vivaldis Op3 Lestro Armonico had been published in Amsterdam in
        1711 and there is little doubt that the Prince brought this edition containing twelve concertos to Weimar in
        1713 as Bach apparently used this print for five of his solo keyboard arrangements The Prince who also composed
        Italianate concertos presumably encouraged Bach to produce solo keyboard arrangements of such works As the
        Prince left Weimar in July 1714 it is estimated that most of Bachs solo keyboard arrangements of Italian and
        Italianate concertos originated in the period from July 1713 to July 1714 That is at least those arrangements
        that could be performed on a harpsichord without pedalboard while the Weimar court organ which would be needed
        for arrangements including pedals such as BWV 592597 would have been unavailable for undergoing repairs in this
        period

        Bachs manualiter arrangement BWV974 of the Marcello concerto was apparently not based on the Amsterdam edition
        but must have been based on a lost manuscript version of the concerto that circulated before it was printed The
        July 1713 to July 1714 timeframe may fit for the production of the arrangement of this concerto although an
        earlier or later date is possible too Bachs autograph of the solo keyboard arrangement is lost but the
        arrangement was copied around 1715 by Bachs second cousin Johann Bernhard as the third item in a manuscript
        containing 12 of Johann Sebastians keyboard transcriptions of Italian and Italianate concertos In 1739 Johann
        Bernhards son Johann Ernst wrote a title page for this collection suggesting that the collection contained
        Vivaldi arrangements for organ exclusively He may have intended this title page for the first concerto in the
        collection only which was indeed an arrangement of a Vivaldi concerto but an unknown hand later added the number
        XII before the title thus causing the misunderstanding that all 12 were Vivaldi arrangements Another copy of
        Bachs arrangement indicates Marcello without first name as the composer of the original work and JS Bach as the
        arranger That copy specifying harpsichord as the intended instrument for the arrangement originated after Johann
        Bernhards but may have been copied from an earlier stage of Bachs arrangement Another manuscript containing
        Bachs arrangement of Marcellos oboe concerto indicated JSB as composer on the title page without mentioning an
        earlier model or its composer for the composition

        The ornamentation as indicated in Bachs keyboard version of the concerto works well on harpsichord but is less
        suitable for performance on an early 18thcentury oboe Nonetheless Bachs ornamentation has been used for
        20thcentury publications of the oboe concerto the ornamentation causes fewer problems when performed on a modern
        oboe Editions of the Dminor version of the oboe concerto with an ornamentation which is better in line with the
        possibilities of a baroque oboe have been proposed since the late 20th century

        Another transcription of the concerto as concerto a 5 for oboe strings and continuo in Cminor is found in a 1717
        manuscript The type of errors in this manuscript seems to suggest that the transposition from Dminor to Cminor
        may have been produced by its scribes while copying This manuscript writes the composers name as Marcello
        without specifying a first name as Alessandros brother Benedetto was far better known as a composer by the name
        Marcello later generations would interpret the title of the manuscript as referring to the better known of the
        Marcello composers

        The piece has three movements

        The concerto survives in different printed and manuscript versions one of these in C minor

        The concerto has also been recorded played on a piccolo trumpet a notoriously challenging transcription due to
        the breath control and tight embouchure required for its sustained passages in the higher register
