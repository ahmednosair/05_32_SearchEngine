  Archer typeface
  Archer is a slab serif typeface designed in 2001 by Tobias FrereJones and Jonathan Hoefler for use in Martha Stewart Living magazine It was later released by Hoefler  FrereJones for commercial licensing

  The typeface is a geometric slab serif one with a geometric design similar to sansserif fonts It takes inspiration from midtwentieth century designs such as Rockwell

  The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentiethcentury European slabserifs but imbuing the face with a domestic less strident tone of voice Balls were added to the upper terminals on letters such as C and G to increase its charm Italics are true italic designs with flourishes influenced by calligraphy an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs As with many Hoefler  FrereJones designs it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines

  The typeface has been used for among other things branding for Wells Fargo and is a main font for the San Francisco Chronicle and Wes Andersons film The Grand Budapest Hotel It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the Design Observer website

  Swiss chalet style
  Swiss chalet style   is an architectural style of Late Historicism originally inspired by rural chalets in Switzerland and the Alpine mountainous regions of Central Europe The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments It spread over Germany AustriaHungary and Scandinavia during the Belle poque era

  Swiss chalet style originated in the Romantic era of the late18thearly19th century when the ideas of the English landscape garden inspired parks and residences in Germany such as the DessauWrlitz Garden Realm It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the simple life of people living in the mountains

  The chalet style soon spread over the German Mittelgebirge landscapes such as the Harz mountains or the Dresden area and the adjacent North Bohemian region As a modern building style it also influenced the resort architecture along the Baltic seaside like in Binz or Heringsdorf Around 1900 design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like Heinrich von Ferstel to build larger mansions and hotels

  The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America notably in the architecture of Norway Iceland and the Netherlands and in the country house architecture of Sweden and Cincinnati Ohio USA in the late 19th and early 20th century English examples of the chalet style include the Boathouse at Belton House Lincolnshire by Anthony Salvin and the Swiss Cottage at Osbourne House on the Isle of Wight constructed for Queen Victorias children

  Along with Nick Gage Justice Pain and Ric Blade Lobo was trained by John Zandig at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school In February 1999 Lobo became the second Iron Man Champion He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first Cage of Death show Lobo won the match and regained the title He would lose this title to Wifebeater but regain it one more time the following year

  Lobo also challenged for the CZW Heavyweight Championship He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000 He held the title until Cage of Death II At that show Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match Directly following this match Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match In the match Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title After losing the title Lobo continued feuding with Zandig This time the feud was for ownership of CZW On February 9 2002 Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW He held this position until Cage of Death IV when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZWs owner

  He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match While he was gone a new group called the HiV tried to take over CZW with Zandig as their main target Zandig was planning to face the HiV at Cage of Death V but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4 At Night of Infamy II
  Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death Their team was successful In February 2004 Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame After this Lobo remained inactive for the following two years

  At Cage of Death 7 Zandig who had turned on the fans wanted to run CZW the way they used to He called out Lobo who was backstage for the event and they joined each other along with Justice Pain and Nick Gage They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW

  Antisubmarine missile
  An antisubmarine missile is a standoff antisubmarine weapon Often a variant of antiship missile designs an antisubmarine systems typically use a jet or rocket engine to deliver an explosive warhead aimed directly at a submarine a depth charge or a homing torpedo that is carried from a launch ship or other platform to the vicinity of a target

  Depth charges were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged submarines These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine Before World War II shipboard sonar was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range

  Various mortartype projectors including Hedgehog and Squid were devised during World War II to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine

  During the Cold War missiles were developed to provide greater range with reduced recoil Some missiles and rockets such as Hong Sang Eo carry homing torpedoes to provide terminal guidance for the warhead

  The advantage of an antisubmarine missile is the attack standoff range The Swedish Bofors 375mm m50 AntiSubmarine Warfare ASW rockets in the past commonly used by Sweden France Japan and Germany for instance can travel as far as 3600m depending on the rocket used The USSR developed its own antisubmarine rockets in the RBU series and these are still in use in Russia and in countries using Russian designed ships Today antisubmarine rockets have been phased out in most western navies replaced by the Homing ASW Torpedo

  Northern river shark
  The northern river shark or New Guinea river shark Glyphis garricki is a species of requiem shark in the family Carcharhinidae found in scattered tidal rivers and associated coastal waters in northern Australia and in Papua New Guinea This species inhabits areas with poor visibility soft bottoms and large tides with immature sharks ranging into fresh and brackish water It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back tiny eyes and broad fins It measures up to long

  Northern river sharks are likely piscivorous This species is viviparous with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the wet season Very rare and facing threats from commercial and recreational fishing and perhaps also habitat degradation this species has been assessed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature

  The first known specimens of the northern river shark two newborn males from Papua New Guinea were discovered by New Zealand ichthyologist Jack Garrick after whom the species was eventually named This shark was referred to as Glyphis sp C until 2008 when it was formally described by Leonard Compagno William White and Peter R Last in a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation paper The type specimen is a female long collected from the East Alligator River Kakadu National Park Northern Territory

  The northern river shark has been reported from King Sound the Ord River and Doctors Creek near Derby Western Australia the Adelaide and Alligator Rivers in Australias Northern Territory and the Daru region and possibly the Fly River in Papua New Guinea It inhabits large rivers estuaries and coastal bays all of which are characterized by high turbidity silty or muddy bottoms and large tides Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh brackish and salt water salinity ranging from 2 to 36 ppt whereas adults have only been found in marine environments

  Like other members of its genus the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back The head is wide and flattened with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with nictitating membranes Each nostril is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap The sizable mouth is broadly arched with short furrows at the corners Thirtyone to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 3035 tooth rows are in the lower jaw the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved In the largest individuals the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spearshaped with serrations near the tip

  The pectoral fins are large and broad with gently backwardcurving margins and pointed tips The pelvic fins are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins The first dorsal fin is longbased and triangular with the apex almost forming a right angle the second dorsal fin is some twothirds as high as the first The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips No ridge exists between the dorsal fins The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin The caudal fin has a strong lower lobe and a long narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip The dermal denticles are small oval and overlapping bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth This shark is steelgray above and white below the color transition is sharp located well below the eye and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips The maximum known length is  This species differs from the speartooth shark G glyphis in several morphological and meristic characters including having fewer vertebrae 137151 versus 213222 and a lower jagged graywhite color boundary

  With its slender teeth small eyes and high density of ampullae of Lorenzini the northern river shark seems to be adapted for hunting fish in conditions of poor visibility In Doctors Creek sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide Like other requiem sharks this species is viviparous with the developing embryos forming a placental connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of yolk Females give birth around October before the start of the wet season on possibly a biennial cycle One female examined contained nine fetuses The young are born at under long males mature between lengths of  while females mature between lengths of

  The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea Based on present information no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation This species is caught legally and illegally by commercial fisheries using longlines and gillnets as well as by recreational fishers habitat degradation may pose a further threat to its survival Because of its low natural abundance limited distribution stringent habitat requirements and susceptibility to various humancaused threats the IUCN has assessed the northern river shark as critically endangered It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea

  United Church The Chapel on the Hill
  The United Church Chapel on the Hill in Oak Ridge Tennessee was the citys main church during World War II Dedicated on September 30 1943 and completed late in October 1943 it was originally a multidenominational chapel shared by Catholic Protestant and Jewish congregations

  The building design is a US Army Corps of Engineers 700series US Army chapel It is a frame building built on a threebay rectangular plan with a steepled bell tower and a gable entry porch It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II One of the other two chapels the West Chapel in the citys West Village area was later torn down but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use

  The US Army built the chapel to house religious activities as one of numerous community facilities in the townsite area of Oak Ridge The building was dedicated on September 30 1943 in a ceremony that included prayers and talks by a Jewish rabbi a Catholic priest an Episcopal priest a Baptist minister and the minister who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel Its name The Chapel on the Hill comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication

  The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18 1943 when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridges main cafeteria Subsequently several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church led by laypersons to include all denominations A Presbyterian minister working in Knoxville was engaged to conduct weekly services and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of the United Church Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24 1943

  When the ChapelontheHill was completed that same month the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building as the only two churches then officially operating in the Manhattan Project community During the war when Oak Ridges Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services weddings and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant Catholic and Jewish religious backgrounds

  At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge when the population exceeded 70000 the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill East Village Chapel and the Jefferson Theater as well as Sunday school classes in several local schools and a trailer camp By 1951 the United Church ChapelontheHill consolidated as a single interdenominational congregation making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building

  The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and of land from the US Atomic Energy Commission on May 11 1955 for a price of 17116 An adjoining educational building was added in 19561957 The facility continues to operate as a nondenominational Protestant church under lay leadership employing ministers with backgrounds in mainstream Protestant denominations Since 2007 it has been affiliated with the Center for Progressive Christianity The churchs motto is Where People from All Denominations Meet in Their Differences but Are One in Their Search for God

  The ChapelontheHill was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 as a contributing property in the Oak Ridge Historic District

  Open data
  Open data is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish without restrictions from copyright patents or other mechanisms of control The goals of the opensource data movement are similar to those of other opensource movements such as opensource software hardware open content open education open educational resources open government open knowledge open access open science and the open web Paradoxically the growth of the open data movement is paralleled by a rise in intellectual property rights The philosophy behind open data has been long established for example in the Mertonian tradition of science but the term open data itself is recent gaining popularity with the rise of the Internet and World Wide Web and especially with the launch of opendata government initiatives such as Datagov Datagovuk and Datagovin

  Open data can also be linked data when it is it is linked open data One of the most important forms of open data is open government data OGD which is a form of open data created by ruling government institutions Open government datas importance is borne from it being a part of citizens everyday lives down to the most routinemundane tasks that are seemingly far removed from government

  The concept of open data is not new but a formalized definition is  One definition is the Open Definition which can be summarized in the statement that A piece of data is open if anyone is free to use reuse and redistribute it  subject only at most to the requirement to attribute andor sharealike Other definitions including the Open Data Institutes Open data is data that anyone can access use or share have an accessible short version of the definition but refer to the formal definition

  Open data may include nontextual material such as maps genomes connectomes chemical compounds mathematical and scientific formulae medical data and practice bioscience and biodiversity Problems often arise because these are commercially valuable or can be aggregated into works of value Access to or reuse of the data is controlled by organisations both public and private Control may be through access restrictions licenses copyright patents and charges for access or reuse Advocates of open data argue that these restrictions are against the common good and that these data should be made available without restriction or fee In addition it is important that the data are reusable without requiring further permission though the types of reuse such as the creation of derivative works may be controlled by a license

  A typical depiction of the need for open data

  Creators of data often do not consider the need to state the conditions of ownership licensing and reuse instead presuming that not asserting copyright puts the data into the public domain For example many scientists do not regard the published data arising from their work to be theirs to control and consider the act of publication in a journal to be an implicit release of data into the commons However the lack of a license makes it difficult to determine the status of a data set and may restrict the use of data offered in an Open spirit Because of this uncertainty it is also possible for public or private organizations to aggregate said data protect it with copyright and then resell it

  The issue of indigenous knowledge IK poses a great challenge in terms of capturing storage and distribution Many societies in thirdworld countries lack the technicality processes of managing the IK

  At his presentation at the XML 2005 conference Connolly displayed these two quotations regarding open data

  Open data can come from any source This section lists some of the fields that publish or at least discuss publishing a large amount of open data

  The concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established with the formation of the World Data Center system in preparation for the International Geophysical Year of 19571958 The International Council of Scientific Unions now the International Council for Science oversees several World Data Centres with the mandate to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility

  While the opensciencedata movement long predates the Internet the availability of fast ubiquitous networking has significantly changed the context of Open science data since publishing or obtaining data has become much less expensive and timeconsuming

  The Human Genome Project was a major initiative that exemplified the power of open data It was built upon the socalled Bermuda Principles stipulating that All human genomic sequence information  should be freely available and in the public domain in order to encourage research and development and to maximise its benefit to society More recent initiatives such as the Structural Genomics Consortium have illustrated that the open data approach can also be used productively within the context of industrial RD

  In 2004 the Science Ministers of all nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD which includes most developed countries of the world signed a declaration which essentially states that all publicly funded archive data should be made publicly available Following a request and an intense discussion with dataproducing institutions in member states the OECD published in 2007 the OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding as a softlaw recommendation

  Examples of open data in science

  There are a range of different arguments for government open data For example some advocates contend that making government information available to the public as machine readable open data can facilitate government transparency accountability and public participation Open data can be a powerful force for public accountabilityit can make existing information easier to analyze process and combine than ever before allowing a new level of public scrutiny Governments that enable public viewing of data can help citizens engage within the governmental sectors and add value to that data

  Some make the case that opening up official information can support technological innovation and economic growth by enabling third parties to develop new kinds of digital applications and services

  Several national governments have created websites to distribute a portion of the data they collect It is a concept for a collaborative project in municipal Government to create and organize culture for Open Data or Open government data

  Additionally other levels of government have established open data websites There are many government entities pursuing Open Data in Canada Datagov lists the sites of a total of 40 US states and 46 US cities and counties with websites to provide open data eg the state of Maryland the state of California US

  At the international level the United Nations has an open data website that publishes statistical data from member states and UN agencies and the World Bank published a range of statistical data relating to developing countries The European Commission has created two portals for the European Union the EU Open Data Portal which gives access to open data from the EU institutions agencies and other bodies and the PublicData portal that provides datasets from local regional and national public bodies across Europe

  In October 2015 the Open Government Partnership launched the International Open Data Charter a set of principles and best practices for the release of governmental open data formally adopted by seventeen governments of countries states and cities during the OGP Global Summit in Mexico

  The debate on open data is still evolving The best open government applications seek to empower citizens to help small businesses or to create value in some other positive constructive way Opening government data is only a waypoint on the road to improving education improving government and building tools to solve other real world problems While many arguments have been made categorically the following discussion of arguments for and against open data highlights that these arguments often depend highly on the type of data and its potential uses

  Arguments made on behalf of open data include the following


  It is generally held that factual data cannot be copyrighted However publishers frequently add copyright statements often forbidding reuse to scientific data accompanying publications It may be unclear whether the factual data embedded in full text are part of the copyright

  While the human abstraction of facts from paper publications is normally accepted as legal there is often an implied restriction on the machine extraction by robots

  Unlike open access where groups of publishers have stated their concerns open data is normally challenged by individual institutions Their arguments have been discussed less in public discourse and there are fewer quotes to rely on at this time

  Arguments against making all data available as open data include the following


  The goals of the Open Data movement are similar to those of other Open movements


  Several funding bodies which mandate Open Access also mandate Open Data A good expression of requirements truncated in places is given by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research CIHR


  Other bodies active in promoting the deposition of data as well as fulltext include the Wellcome Trust An academic paper published in 2013 advocated that Horizon 2020 the science funding mechanism of the EU due to launch in 2014 should mandate that funded projects hand in their databases as deliverables at the end of the project so that they can be checked for third party usability then shared

  Several mechanisms restrict access to or reuse of data and several reasons for doing this are given above They include

  Dayfine
  A dayfine day fine unit fine or structured fine is a unit of fine payment that above a minimum fine is based on the offenders daily personal income A crime is punished with incarceration for a determined number of days or with fines As incarceration is a financial punishment in the effect of preventing work a dayfine represents one day incarcerated and without salary It is argued to be just because if both highincome and lowincome population are punished with the same jail time they should also be punished with a proportionally similar income loss An analogy may be drawn with income tax which is also proportional to the income even progressively

  Jurisdictions employing the dayfine include Finland  Estonia  Sweden  Denmark  Germany  France  Switzerland and Macao

  Unit fine systems are common and standard in many jurisdictions across the world notably in FennoScandinavia where it originated in 1921 in Finland and in Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand

  In Finland the dayfine system is used for most crimes that are punishable by way of a fine The system has been in use since 1921 Most minor infractions are punished with a fixed petty fine rikesakko ordningsbot such as minor traffic and water traffic violations
  littering and breaches of public peace
  A petty fine is summarily ordered by the police officer if the suspect does not contest his guilt but the person punished may contest the fine in a district court
  Most infractions are punishable with a dayfine For crimes warranting no more than six months in prison the fine may be summarily ordered by the prosecutor if the suspect does not want the court to handle the case The process of ordering a day fine is started by a police officer who makes a formal demand for the suspect to be fined The suspect has one week to contest the demand If the suspect does not contest the demand the prosecutor may order a fine which may not be higher than demanded by the police officer If the suspect contests the demand the case may be taken to the district court if the prosecutor considers the suspect guilty If the prosecutor considers the case to merit a term in prison or a higher fine the case is always taken to the court If the prosecution or the injured party do not demand a higher punishment than a fine the district court has a quorum with a single member The fine is paid to the bank using a giro A fine ordered in Finland is executable in any European Union member country

  A Finnish fine consists of a minimum of 1 dayfine up to a maximum of 120 dayfines If several crimes are punished together 240 dayfines may be sentenced The fines may not be sentenced together with a prison sentence unless the prison sentence is probational The minimum amount of a dayfine is 6 euros Usually the dayfine is one half of daily disposable income The daily disposable income is considered to be one 60th part of the persons monthly mean income during the year after taxes social security payments and a basic living allowance of 255 per month have been deducted In addition every person for whose upkeep the fined person is responsible decreases the amount of daily fine by 3 The income of the person is calculated on the basis of the latest taxation data For speeding in traffic however the fine is at least as high as the petty fine ie 115

  The person who is punished with a fine is responsible for giving accurate information concerning their income Lying about ones income   is a crime punishable with a fine or up to three months in prison The police can however access the taxation data of Finnish citizens and permanent residents via a realtime datalink so the chance of lying successfully is minor There is no maximum dayfine which may lead to considerably high fines for highincome persons For example in 2001 a Finnish businessman with a yearly income of 10 million euros received a relatively mild punishment of six dayfines amounting 26000 for driving though a red traffic light In 2009 a businessman was fined 112000 for travelling at 82 kilometres per hour in an area with a speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour As speeding is punished with a petty fine if the offender is exceeding the speed limit by up to 20kmh but with a dayfine if exceeding the limit by 21kmh or more the monetary amount of the fine can increase from 115 to over 100000 although the actual change in speed is less than 1kmh This has given rise to some criticism most vividly expressed by a Finnish member of parliament avid motorist Klaus Bremer and other MPs of rightwing parties

  The fines are subject to recovery proceedings If the fines are still not paid the court may convert them to a prison sentence Three dayfines will be converted to one day of imprisonment ignoring the remainder for any amount of dayfines not divisible by three and the length of the sentence must be between 4 and 60 days This conversion punishment   is only ever applied to courtordered fines not those issued by police

  Day fines are a concept to which little thought has been given in India Undeniably prisons are overcrowded and disproportionately represent religious minorities and socioeconomically vulnerable castes and tribal groups It is however unclear how much of this is due to fines The IPC provides some safeguards on imposing fines such as monetary caps on fines for some offences and stringent limits for imprisonment for nonpayment of fines Where no upper monetary caps are specified the IPC does not gives courts discretion to impose fines which are unlimited but not excessive While specific fine amounts would require to be done away with in the text of the IPC several underlying actions would need to be done before pressing day fines into service
  Article 45 of the Penal Code  Portuguese  specifies that a criminal fine  Portuguese  shall normally be at least 10 days and at most 360 days One dayfine costs at least 50 Macanese patacas and at most 10000 patacas A court of law imposes the fine based on the economic and financial situations and personal burdens of a convict

  England and Wales experimented with the system for a short period from 1992 to 1993 It was unpopular with both magistrates and the general public and was soon abandoned The scheme was replaced by requirements that magistrates consider an offenders means when imposing a fine just not according to a mathematical formula

  The New York Times reported on an experience with day fines which took place in 1988 in Staten Island which was a partnership between the local courts and District Attorney and the Vera Institute of Justice

  Aeronautica Imperialis
  Aeronautica Imperialis is a tabletop miniature wargame set within the Warhammer 40000 universe The game focuses on aerial combat between the different races of the Warhammer 40000 universe Released in January 2007 it was developed and published by Forge World a division of the British gaming company Games Workshop

  Aeronautica Imperialis is a companion game to Epic which emphasises battles between armies on a larger scale than Warhammer 40000

  Gameplaywise the major difference between Epic and Aeronautica Imperialis is that instead of a player moving and firing tanks and troops they are using aircraft and ground defense weapons

  The Aeronautica Imperialis rulebook contains not only rules for the games but also two sheets of cards which are used to make special manoeuvres Other content in the rulebook is background material on the individual aircraft along with full colour plates and suggestions for painting At the end of the book there is a campaign section with scenarios for players to recreate

  It makes use of currently available aircraft models designed for Epic which are approximately 6mm scale or 1285 Forge Worlds say that Epic models are 5 times smaller than their Warhammer 40000 equivalent In addition to the use of the miniatures Forge World also sells special bases for the game to indicate such things as the altitude speed and fire arcs of each aeroplane

  The currently supported races or factions are the Imperial Navy Space Marines Eldar Tau Chaos and Orks

  Aeronautica Imperialis has a strong tie with the Black Library book Double Eagle by Dan Abnett This deals with the air war occurring during the Sabbat Worlds Campaign the setting for Abnetts Gaunts Ghosts novel series It has a Battle of Britain flavour many of the concepts elucidated in the Aeronautica rules can be seen in Abnetts writing

  In late 2007 Forge World released Tactica Aeronautica a collection of extra rules new aircraft and scenarios for the game

  Greek destroyer Ierax 1912
  Ierax   Hawk was an which had been built for Argentina as Santa Fe She served in the Hellenic Royal Navy from 1912 to 1946

  Four sister ships  Ierax and  had originally been ordered as the San Luis class by Argentina from the English shipyard Cammell Laird in Birkenhead The second was completed as Santa Fe They were purchased in 1912 by Greece ready for delivery each for the sum of 148000 when the Balkan Wars seemed likely Ierax was accepted by Captain Ath Miaoulis RHN in Palermo Sicily where she arrived manned by a foreign crew

  During the Balkan Wars the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition 3000 rounds of torpedoes Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship and for this reason these ships were initially named scouts rather than destroyers On October 21 1912 under the command of Commander A Vratsanos RHN Ierax was part of the Greek flotilla that captured the island of Psara from the Ottomans

  During World War I Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and due to Greeces neutrality the four Aetosclass ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916 taken over by the French in November and served in the French Navy from 191718 By 1918 they were back on escort duty under Greek colors mainly in the Aegean Sea

  Ierax participated in the evacuation of Greeks from Russia during the Russian Civil War in 1918 and saw action in the GrecoTurkish War 19191922 in the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean Sea

  After the war Ierax was refurbished from 19251927 She also participated in the Second World War after surviving the German invasion of April 1941 Ierax was based in Alexandria Egypt In April 1944 a wave of mutiny swept through some of the Hellenic Royal Navy with seamen agitating in favor of the proCommunist guerrillas ELAS who were fighting a campaign in Greece against the occupying Nazis Ierax was one of the ships whose crew mutinied and the mutiny was put down in the early morning hours of 22 April 1944

  After the end of World War II Ierax was stricken decommissioned in 1946

  Dental caries also known as tooth decay is uncommon among companion animals The bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis cause dental caries by metabolising sugars

  The term feline cavities is commonly used to refer to feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions however sacchrolytic acidproducing bacteria the same responsible for Dental plaque are not involved in this condition

  Although rarely seen in cats the incidence of caries in dogs has been estimated at approximately 5 Dogs are less likely than humans to have tooth decay due to the very high pH of dog saliva which prevents an acidic environment from forming and the subsequent demineralization of enamel which would occur In the event that tooth decay does occur usually from trauma dogs can receive dental fillings just as humans do

  Moses Yale Beach
  Moses Yale Beach January 7 1800  July 18 1868 was an American inventor and publisher who started the Associated Press and is credited with originating print syndication

  He was born in Wallingford Connecticut His father was a plain farmer and gave him an ordinary education He early showed a mechanical aptitude and at 14 was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker Before his term was up he purchased his freedom and established a cabinet making business in Northampton Massachusetts The business failed and he moved to Springfield There he endeavored to manufacture a gunpowder engine for propelling balloons but this enterprise was also a failure He next attempted to open steam navigation on Connecticut river between Hartford and Springfield and would have succeeded if financial difficulties had not obliged him to cease operations before his steamer was completed

  He then invented a ragcutting machine for paper mills The invention was widely used but Beach derived no pecuniary benefit due to his tardiness in applying for a patent He then settled in Ulster County New York where he invested in an extensive paper mill At first he was successful and after six years was wealthy but after seven years an imprudent investment dispersed his fortune and he was compelled to abandon his enterprise

  In the meantime though he had married the sister of the founder and proprietor of the New York Sun Benjamin Day In 1835 he acquired an interest in the paper then small both in the size of its sheet and circulation And with a 40000 payment he soon became sole proprietor

  According to historian Elmo Scott Watson Beach invented print syndication in 1841 when he produced a twopage supplement and sold it to a score of newspapers in the US northeast

  The Associated Press was organized in May 1846 by Beach at that time publisher of The Sun joined by the New York Herald the New York Courier and Enquirer The Journal of Commerce and the New York Evening Express The AP was formed by the five New York daily papers to share the cost of transmitting news of the MexicanAmerican War

  During the War US President James K Polk sent Beach to Mexico to arrange a treaty of peace but the negotiations were broken off by a false report announcing the defeat of General Zachary Taylor by Mexican General Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna

  Beach retired in 1857 with an ample fortune and left the paper to his sons He then returned to Wallingford

  Beach was married twice and left five sons Moses Sperry Henry Alfred Ely Joseph and William and one granddaughter Emmeline who married the naturalist and artist Abbott Handerson Thayer She was the daughter of Moses Sperry Beach She and her father are described in Mark Twains The Innocents Abroad

  Goodenough College
  Goodenough College is a postgraduate residence and educational trust on Mecklenburgh Square in Bloomsbury central London England Other names under which the college has been known are London House William Goodenough House and the London Goodenough Trust

  Goodenough College is an educational charity that provides residential accommodation for talented British and international postgraduates and their families studying in London The College provides a vibrant community for all those who live here through a unique programme of intellectual cultural and social activities that aims to provide Members with an international network and a truly global outlook

  The current director of the college is Rebecca Matthews MA Cantab Former Managing Director of the European Capital of Culture Aarhus 2017

  Goodenough has residential and study facilities and an extensive extracurricular programme which includes a conference series aimed at examining subjects of international concern As of 2018 the College is home to approximately 700 International postgraduate students and their families representing approximately 80 different nations

  The college is located in London and set on Mecklenburgh Square around a private garden to which only residents have access

  The college was incorporated in 1930 by a group of prominent Londoners including the chairman of Barclays Bank and founder of Barclays Bank DCO Dominion Colonial and Overseas Frederick Craufurd Goodenough Goodenough and his friends wanted to provide able young men coming to London from the dominions and colonies future leaders of what was then a large empire with a collegiate life along Oxbridge lines in London The college was a moot hall and at the same time a place where they would form lasting friendships in tolerance and understanding

  The search for a site for the new college was centred on Bloomsbury to which the University of London was preparing a move from South Kensington An ideal island site for sale freehold was found between Guilford Street and Mecklenburgh Square and the College bought it in 1930

  Plans were to design and build a new college but this would take time which the governors did not want to waste In the traditional manner of Bloomsburys philanthropic institutions they made a start in a small way in some of the roomy old houses on the site London House first opened its doors in October 1931 in Nos 47 Caroline Place now Mecklenburgh Place on the west side of the site The house was soon full with a long waiting list and by the start of World War II occupied all the Caroline Place houses

  A new London House for 300 single students was built between 1935 and 1963 to the designs of the architect Sir Herbert Baker his partner Alexander T Scott and their successor Vernon Helbing It was completed in three stages

  Stage 1 193537 The southeast corner including the Great Hall Charles Parsons Library commonrooms and the Guilford Street entrance This was the only part to be completed in Sir Herbert Bakers lifetime

  Stage 2 194853 The rest of the south wing the west wing and the northwest corner Alexander Scott continued in Bakers style with some simplification of detail

  Stage 3 196163 The north wing including the northeast corner It was built to a lower cost than the other stages for example no flintwork At the same time architect Vernon Helbing created the college chapel out of former offices

  In the 1940s at the instigation of the Chairman of the College Governors Sir William Goodenough the Lord Mayor of London launched a Thanksgiving Fund to raise money in the UK and do something to thank the people of the Commonwealth and the United States for their generous gifts especially of food parcels during and after World War II The money raised was used to build William Goodenough House for women and married students from those countries replacing houses destroyed or badly damaged in the war on the north east of the Square At the same time the bombed houses in adjacent Heathcote Street were rebuilt as an annexe and the House was completed in 1957 Later wings Julian Crossley Court 1974 and Ashley Ponsonby Court 1991 brought the capacity of the House up to 120 rooms for single students and 60 flats for married couples and families

  The two parallel institutions developed their own characters over time  the quiet surroundings of the WGH common rooms appealed to some LH residents and various Willie G girls preferred the noisier atmosphere of the London House bar Traditions developed such as the LH rugby team singing lullabies to the inhabitants of WGH after the annual sports dinner and many LHWGH romances flourished and in some cases resulted in marriage and even children The two houses London House and William Goodenough House eventually became mixed in 1991

  Nos 2225 Mecklenburgh Square survived the war and were used as a nurses home until 1989 when they were handed back in a very dilapidated state At first the houses were repaired and used as inexpensive accommodation for shortstay visitors mostly returning alumni and other academics in London to attend conferences and seminars By 1997 however it was apparent that the building required modernization if they were to meet the standards that would be required in the 21st century

  The houses were closed and plans made to add No 21 and renovate and upgrade at a cost of 35 million There were delays because the Georgian houses are listed buildings in a conservation area and the work required the approval of both English Heritage and the London Borough of Camden planning department Eventually the plans were passed and the Goodenough Club opened its doors in April 2001 The hotel is open to academic and professional visitors as well as conference delegates from around the world and was renamed as The Goodenough on Mecklenburgh Square in 2018

  As the name of the college and of the Directors equivalent position has changed over time the title of each appointee is given

  Up until the 1970s London House was a singlesex menonly building The position of London House warden was abolished in 2008

  From the instigation of William Goodenough House in 1950 it was run by a separate warden Up until the 1970s William Goodenough House was a singlesex womenonly building while London House was a menonly building The position of William Goodenough House warden was abolished in 2007

  Dendi Kingdom
  The Dendi Kingdom 15911901 was a West African state in modernday Niger founded by the Dendi people after the collapse of the Songhai Empire It was conquered by France in 1901

  Under the Songhai empire Dendi had been the easternmost province governed by the prestigious Dendifari governor of the eastern front Askia Ishaq II fled to here after he was defeated by the invading Saadi dynasty of Morocco at the Battle of Tondibi and at another battle seven months later In Dendi he was deposed by his brother Muhammad Gao who was in turn murdered on the order of the Moroccan pasha The Moroccans then appointed Sulayman as puppet king ruling the Niger between Djenn and Gao South of Tillaberi the Songhai resistance against Morocco continued under Askia Nuh a son of Askia Dawud He established his capital at the yet unlocalized town of Lulami

  After the Moroccans had Askia Sulayman appointed as their puppet the pasha Mahmud ibn Zarqun attempted to conquer Dendi Askia Nuh resisted the invasion by a costly guerilla warfare lasting two years In 1594 Mahmud was forced to discontinue the war and retreated just to be killed in the same year by Dogon with whom Nuh was probably allied The new pasha called Mansur continued the war against Dendi and again Nuh resorted to guerilla warfare This situation lasted until 1599 when Nuhs followers became tired of the war and deposed him in favor of his brother Harun
  In 1609 the Malian city of Djenn revolted against the Saadi pashas governors with Dendi support The Saadi were eventually able to regain the city but with a lack of support from their homeland they soon abandoned the area leaving it to Tuareg and Fulbe nomads

  In 1612 Askiya alAmin came to power in Dendi His short reign of six years was followed by the rule of Askiya Dawud Dawud killed many people during his reign including relatives and members of the military His brother Ismail fled to Timbuktu and sought Saadi support to overthrow alAmin Ismail returned in to Dendi and deposed his brother in 1639 Upon attempting to send the foreign army back he was deposed and replaced by a ruler that the pashas felt would be easier to deal with This ruler was eventually removed by the Songhai people

  Dendi existed for the next two and a half centuries witnessing increasingly unstable reigns coups and countercoups When France entered the region Dendi was defensively unprepared In 1901 the French deposed the last askiya of the Dendi ending Songhais control of either Mali or Niger until independence

  Franz Xaver Gerl
  Franz Xaver Gerl    was a bass singer and composer of the classical era He sang the role of Sarastro in the premiere of Mozarts opera The Magic Flute

  Gerl was born on in Andorf then Bavaria since 1780 part of Austria He sang as a chorister as a child in Salzburg the New Grove asserts that he was probably the pupil of Leopold Mozart He attended the University of Salzburg studying logic and physics His career as a bass began in 1785 with the theatrical company of Ludwig Schmidt

  He evidently had an impressively low vocal range Branscombe 1991 observes that the very low notes that Mozart included in the part of Sarastro have been the despair of many a bass singer since

  By 1787 he had joined the theatrical company of Emanuel Schikaneder for which he sang the demanding role of Osmin in Mozarts opera The Abduction from the Seraglio and other roles In 1789 the troupe settled at the Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna Gerl participated in a system of joint composition used by Schikaneders troupe in which Singspiele were produced rapidly by having several composers collaborate As such Gerl may have been the composer of the aria Ein Weib ist das herrlichste Ding for which Mozart wrote a set of variations for piano K 613 the composer may instead have been another singercomposer in the troupe Benedikt Schack

  Mozart gradually came to participate more in the activities of the Schikaneder troupe culminating in his opera The Magic Flute 1791 with libretto by Schikaneder Gerl premiered the role of Sarastro and continued to sing this part in many performances through 1792 He left Schikaneders troupe in 1793

  Gerl may have been a participant in a rehearsal of Mozarts Requiem on the day before the composer died for details see Benedikt Schack

  Gerls later career took him to Brno and Mannheim where he retired in 1826 He died there on

  Peter Branscombe writing in the New Grove offers the following concerning Gerls reputation as a singer When Schrder the greatest actormanager of his age went to Vienna in 1791 he was told not to miss hearing Benedikt Schack and Gerl at Schikaneders theatre Branscombe also notes the striking quality of the music that Mozart wrote for Gerl

  Gerl married the soprano Barbara Reisinger 17701806 on 2 September 1789 She also sang in the Schikaneder troupe and performed the role of Papagena at the Magic Flute premiere She went with Gerl to Brno and Mannheim and died there shortly after giving birth to their second child

  Nephi the Disciple
  According to the Book of Mormon Nephi   the Disciple was a Nephite prophet during the 1st century and a chosen disciple of Jesus Christ Nephis ministry was centered on Christ and included prophesying of His birth working miracles in His name witnessing His visitation to the Americas after the Resurrection and administering His church after He had ascended Nephi was also the appointed recordkeeper for the Nephites during this period and much of the text of Third Nephi is abridged from his account

  Nephi is first mentioned in the Book of Mormon when he inherits the Nephite records and sacred artifacts from his father Nephi son of Helaman in the year 1 BC He lived and was likely raised in the Nephite capital city Zarahemla where his father lived and subsequently departed from leaving Nephi with the full responsibilities of scribe Neither Nephis childhood nor age are referenced in the abridgement although he had at least one younger sibling Timothy It is believed that he was born in 30 BC

  In the ninetysecond year of the Reign of the Judges 1 BC a great uproar broke out amongst the population over the yetunfulfilled and according to the unbelievers pastdue prophecy of Samuel the Lamanite that Christs birth would be signified by a new star and a night without darkness Those who continued to look forward to the sign of Christ were scheduled for a mass execution

  Nephi deeply disturbed by the wickedness of the people prayed mightily to God for the condemned believers even all day Finally the voice of the Lord came to him saying
  Lift up your head and be of good cheer for behold the time is at hand and on this night shall the sign be given and on the morrow come I into the world to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets

  As promised when the sun set that evening the sky remained as bright as midday fulfilling the anticipated prophecies and effectively preventing the impending genocide A majority of the population was converted by this event and Nephi went about baptizing unto repentance in the which there was a great remission of sins which temporarily restored peace to the land

  Despite the mass change of heart and the continued preaching of Nephi and many others however by 96 ROJ AD 3 the people had already returned to wickedness and discrediting the miracles they had seen For the next twentyseven years they would continue to fluctuate between extremes of piousness and rebellion until finally abandoning their faith altogether The government of over 120 years was intentionally corrupted and assassinated into extinction and the society unraveled into tribes

  Nephi having witnessed this downfall renewed his efforts and began to preach with such boldness and power that the people were angry with him even because he had greater power than they for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words

  Additionally Nephi performed miracles in the name of Christ including casting out devils healing the sick and raising his brother from the dead He continued to preach and baptize throughout AD 33 converting many

  In the advent of the next year the signs of Christs death three hours of unparalleled destruction followed by three days of darkness also prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite were given

  White Shark Caf
  The White Shark Caf is a remote midPacific Ocean area noted as a winter and spring habitat of otherwise coastal great white sharks

  The area halfway between Baja California and Hawaii received its unofficial name in 2002 from researchers at Stanford Universitys Hopkins Marine Station who were studying the great white shark species using satellite tracking tags They identified a zone with a radius of approximately centered at approximately  The findings which were initially published in the January 3 2002 issue of the journal Nature showed three of four tagged sharks traveled to the Caf during a sixmonth period after they were tagged off the central coast of California

  Although the area had not previously been suspected as a shark habitat when mapping the satellite tracking data researchers discovered that members of the species frequently travel to and loiter in the area It was once believed the area had very little food for the animals researchers described it as the shark equivalent of a desert but research in early 2018 by the vessel Falkor showed that there is a rich and diverse food chain too deep to be detected by satellites that provides a potentially abundant food supply for the sharks Male female and juvenile great whites have been tracked there

  The sharks tracked to the area came from diverse rookeries along the North American coast They typically took up to 100 days to arrive traveling around  during which they make periodic dives as deep as  While at the Caf they dive to depths of as often as once every ten minutes

  By 2006 researchers had observed consistent migration and other behavior Tracking data indicates that white sharks will leave feeding grounds near the coast in winter travel to the Caf and some may even summer near Hawaii But many linger in the Caf often for months before returning to the coast in the fall coinciding with the elephant seal breeding season a favored prey

  To save on construction costs elements of the former Buzz Saw Falls Water Coaster which was manufactured by Premier Rides and was replaced by Powder Keg were used for the new ride namely the lift hill structure Other tributes to the former ride can be found in the thematic elements surrounding the queue line such as an old Buzzsaw Falls car stuck in the roof of the first queue building and a piece of old Buzzsaw track sticking out of the queue buildings roof

  Before the train launches a short audio track plays A man with a deep voice says three lines as of the 2017 season

  The train moves forward out of the nitro shed and a siren goes off and the stop lights go redyellowyellowgreen and flames would shoot out of the nitro shed
  Soon after the train launches using compressed air and the ride starts

  In 2007 one more modification to the prelaunch sequence was made where stoplights were added on the launch section to go from redyellowyellowgreen while making a siren sound and then launching like usual Before the 2007 season the nitro shed would just shoot flames and the train would launch soon after

  After being launched out onto the track riders go up a relatively small hill and down a very steep drop Riders go up and down hills many times and go through several tight turns before slowly traveling up a chainlift hill equipped with audio speakers playing bluegrass music The train goes through a 90degree left turn before going down another steep drop onto a small spraypainted blue section of the track At the final end of the ride the train travels through a large helix that almost turns the track completely upside down before the train slams into the final brakes and turns into the station

 <doc id="7700417" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700417" title="Ikastola">
  Ikastola
  An Ikastola  plural ikastolak is a type of primary and secondary school in the Basque Autonomous Community Navarre and to a much lesser extent the French Basque Country see Basque Country in which pupils are taught either entirely or predominantly in the Basque language Ikastolak can be nowadays either private or public divided into different networks

  The Basque language public network relies on state funding and management allocated in Spain by the education institutions of the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre in their corresponding territories while in France the association IkasBi in the public network advocates for bilingual education Seaska is the private network of Basque language schools in the French Basque Country closely linked to the similar network in the Southern Basque Country The private networks base their activity on the fees paid by parents popular subscription either directly or by means of annual massive festivals eg Herri Urrats Nafarroa Oinez Araba Euskaraz etc and the allowance provided by public educational institutions

  Although spoken more widely than in later times there was very little schooling undertaken in Basque before the early 20th century revival in Basque nationalism Spanish and French were mandatory in schooling at either side of the border The first official ikastola was opened in 1914 and the movement to transfer the medium of education in the Southern Basque Country from Spanish to Basque became widespread in the late 20th century

  During the early 1930s the seeds of the Basque Schools Escuelas Vascas were sown in Navarre by the Basque Nationalist Party featuring an instruction where the teachings of the Christian doctrine were central They were conceived as an attempt to counter increased laicization of state schools and the lack of focus the neutrality on Basque matters in regular religious schooling The first such educative institution was founded in November 1931 at Pamplona followed by another one in EstellaLizarra 1933 and Elizondo 1935

  Following the Republican defeat in the Spanish Civil War the public use of Basque was made illegal and all educational institutions were forced to teach entirely through the medium of Castilian to the complete neglect and persecution of Basque There are however isolated examples of ikastolak which clandestinely continued to teach in Basque

  Since thousands of children were studying out of the authorized schools and hence forbidden to progress to higher education in 1969 the Roman Catholic Church arranged with the parent associations the lawful Diocesan Federation of Ikastolas later becoming a secular federation With the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975 large degrees of selfgovernment were given to the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre and ikastolak sprang up all over the Basque region in northern Spain

  For a time the ikastolak operated along the public school system the private schools publicly funded under a charter and the private schools During his term as Basque minister for education the Socialist Fernando Buesa proposed the 1993 Law of the Basque Public School prompting ikastolak to choose between full integration in the public system or operating under the rules for chartered private schools

  At the present time tens of thousands of schoolchildren in the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre attend ikastolak but the status of ikastolak differs greatly depending on their location They are firmly entrenched in the traditionally Basquespeaking areas of the Basque Autonomous Community BAC but less so in nonBasque speaking areas ie the southern fringes Basque language schools in the north of Navarre do not enjoy the same support from the regional government as they do in the BAC but they are officially recognised and enjoy widespread local support traditionally Basque speaking unlike central and southern areas of Navarre where they lack public recognition and funding remaining in a legal limbo until 2007

  In the French Basque Country the ikastolak developed later but grew steadily so much so that a network Seaska is now widespread throughout the whole territory covering education up to the A levels

  Clean sweep naval
  A clean sweep for a naval vessel refers to having swept the enemy from the seas a completely successful mission It is traditionally indicated by hanging a broom from a mast or lashing it to the periscope of a submarine

  It is said the use of brooms in this respect originated during the 1650s when the Dutch Admiral Maarten Tromp after a decisive victory in the First AngloDutch War the Battle of Dungeness of 1652 hung a broom from his mast to indicate he had swept the British from the seas  his opponent Admiral Blake is said to have responded with the hoisting of a whip indicating he would whip the Dutch into submission However both stories are legends a broom in the seventeenth century indicated the ship was for sale

  The United States Submarine Service during World War II generally considered a patrol a clean sweep if the sub sank every target she engaged Individual torpedoes might miss and convoys usually had far too many ships for all to be sunk by a single boat but these unavoidable inefficiencies did not mar a clean sweep

  Few wideranging war patrols have been conducted since World War II so commanding officers have taken other opportunities to fly brooms For example in the year 2000 the Military Sealift Command hung a broom from the flagpole yardarm outside their headquarters to symbolize its clean sweep of the Y2K bug on all the commands ships

  In 2003 under circumstances perhaps closer to the traditional context after USS Cheyenne launched her Tomahawk missiles during Operation Iraqi Freedom her commanding officer decided that placing all missiles on target with no duds or failures was a modern clean sweep

  For decades brooms have been flown by warships that successfully pass all elements of their sea trials Examples include USS Ohio in 2005 and
  USS Virginia SSN774 in 2006

 <doc id="7700494" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700494" title="Rhizopogon">
  Rhizopogon
  Rhizopogon is a genus of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes in the family Rhizopogonaceae Species form hypogeous sporocarps commonly referred to as false truffles The general morphological characters of Rhizopogon sporocarps are a simplex or duplex peridium surrounding a loculate gleba that lacks a columnella Basidiospores are produced upon basidia that are borne within the fungal hymenium that coats the interior surface of gleba locules The peridium is often adorned with thick mycelial cords also known as rhizomorphs that attach the sporocarp to the surrounding substrate The scientific name Rhizopogon is Greek for root Rhiz beard pogon and this name was given in reference to the rhizomorphs found on sporocarps of many species

  Rhizopogon species are primarily found in ectomycorrhizal association with trees in the family Pinaceae and are especially common symbionts of pine fir and Douglas fir trees Through their ectomycorrhizal relationships Rhizopogon are thought to play an important role in the ecology of coniferous forests Recent micromorphological and molecular phylogenetic study has established that Rhizopogon is a member of the Boletales closely related to Suillus

  The genus Rhizopogon occurs throughout the natural and introduced ranges of family Pinaceae trees Though this range covers much of the northern temperate zones the diversity of Rhizopogon species is well characterized only in North America and Europe There are currently over 150 recognized species of Rhizopogon The morphology of Rhizopogon species is highly cryptic and characters vary greatly throughout sporocarp maturity This has led to the description of multiple species from various developmental stages of a single fungus

  The genus Rhizopogon was first described from Europe by Elias Magnus Fries in 1817 The North American monograph was produced by Alexander H Smith in 1966 with second author credits given posthumously to Sanford Myron Zeller due to his contributions to the study of the genus A European monograph of Rhizopogon has also been published In the recent past molecular phylogenetic methods have allowed the revision of the taxonomic concepts of the genus Rhizopogon

  Modern taxonomic concepts of the genus Rhizopogon recognize five subgenera of Rhizopogon These are subgenus Rhizopogon subgenus Versicolores subgenus Villosuli subgenus Amylopogon and subgenus Roseoli

  Rhizopogon species have been established as a common component in the diet of many small mammals as well as deer in Western North America The viability of Rhizopogon spores is maintained and may even be increased after mammalian gut passage making mammals an important dispersal vector for Rhizopogon

  Rhizopogon species are common members of the fungal communities that colonize the roots of trees during seedling establishment and persist into old growth stands Rhizopogon spores are long lived in soil and the spores of some species can persist for at least four years with an increase in viability over time Rhizopogon seems to be especially common upon the roots of establishing tree seedlings following disturbance such as fire or logging Rhizopogon are also abundant colonizers of pot cultivated and field cultivated conifer seedlings growing in soil from conifer stands that lacked observations of Rhizopogon upon the roots of mature trees These finding suggest that Rhizopogon species are an important factor in the recovery of conifer forests following disturbance

  The first intentional use of Rhizopogon species in forestry occurred in the early part of the 20th century when Rhizopogon luteolus was deliberately introduced into Pinus radiata plantations in Western Australia after it was observed to improve tree growth Since that time Rhizopogon species have been widely studied as a component of managed forests Rhizopogon species have been noted as common members of the ectomycorrhizal community colonizing tree roots of pine and Douglasfir timber plantations Naturally occurring Rhizopogon roseolus rubescens spores have been shown to outcompete the spores of other ectomycorrhizal fungi in pine plantations even when competing spores were directly inoculated onto seedlings The survival rate and performance of pine and Douglasfir plantation seedlings are increased after inoculation with Rhizopogon species

  Though many species of Rhizopogon are considered edible most are not held in high culinary esteem A notable exception is Rhizopogon roseolus rubescens which is considered a delicacy in east Asia and especially in Japan where it is traditionally known as Shoro Techniques for the commercial cultivation of this fungus in pine plantations have been developed and applied with successful results in Japan and New Zealand

  AntiBin Tax Campaign
  The AntiBin Tax Campaign opposed the introduction of bin charges garbagecollection fees by local authorities in Ireland The campaign centred largely in city areas in particular Dublin It was locally based with some coordination in the Dublin area Nonpayment was the tactic used against the charge

  The campaign was supported by a variety of people from community and minor political groupings such as Socialist Party Socialist Workers Party Irish Socialist Network Workers Solidarity Movement and Working Class Action

  In Autumn 2003 after years of mass nonpayment the Dublin local authorities began noncollection leading to protests and blockades of bin trucks In the High Court Fingal County Council sought an injunction and the imprisonment of Joe Higgins and Clare Daly of the Socialist Party and Irish Socialist Network members John ONeill and Colm Breathnach These imprisonments escalated the campaign and for a number of weeks refuse collection in the Dublin area was severely disrupted due to protests In total 22 people were imprisoned

  The campaign failed in its objective to reverse the introduction of bin charges In the years to follow many councils privatized refuse collection services

  The campaign was described by The Phoenix Magazine as an abject failure which left many thousands of families across Dublin in financial and legal difficulty it proved a useful campaign and publicity tool for SP candidates in a number of constituencies

  At the 2004 local elections following the noncollection phase of the campaign AntiBin Tax a number of candidates were elected The Socialist Party gained two seats one on Cork City Council and one on South Dublin County Council bringing its total up to four Joan Collins running as an Independent won a seat in the CrumlinKimmage local electoral area on Dublin City Council

  Cieran Perry of Working Class Action running as an independent narrowly missed election by 93 votes in Cabra polling 1753 votes Dublin city chair of Stop the Bin Tax campaign Joe Mooney ran in the Dublin North Inner City electoral ward unsuccessfully

  Joe Mooney was involved in one of the most prominent incidents of the AntiBin Tax Campaign when he was hit by a Dublin City Council truck while the campaign tried to blockade a bin truck depot he was carried down a road by a bin truck before falling off He was slightly injured

  Peshawar Club Ground
  The Peshawar Club Ground is a cricket ground in Peshawar Pakistan used for one Test match between India and Pakistan It staged first class cricket matches from 1938 to 1987

  The history of first class cricket at the Peshawar Club Ground began with the North West Frontier Province in the Indian Ranji Trophy With the separation of Pakistan in 1949 the NWFP team was admitted into the QuaideAzam Trophy and again played at Peshawar until they were replaced in the Trophy by a Peshawar city team in 1956 Before that Pakistan had entertained India for the only Test match to be played here In a drawn fourday encounter Polly Umrigar hit a century for India before he was run out

  The following year New Zealand played a GovernorGeneral of Pakistans XI here while a fullstrength Pakistan side beat a nonTest touring team from Marylebone Cricket Club For QuaideAzam Trophy matches the Peshawar team switched between this ground and the Peshawar Gymkhana Ground until 1971 In 1957 Peshawar off spinner Haseeb Ahsan achieved the best figures on the ground with thirteen for 47 in a match against Punjab B

  Touring teams occasionally visited the ground though no more Test matches were played In 1967 an MCC U25 side played a Pakistan North Zone team a match which is notable for Mike Brearleys highest first class score The visitors captain made 312 not out in a day as MCC piled up 514 for four against opposition including the later Test captain Intikhab Alam declared then won by an innings and 139 runs on the third day He shared double century stands with Alan Knott and Alan Ormrod records for the first and fifth wickets at the ground and his innings remains the highest on the ground despite Zakir Butts 290 for Pakistan Railways six years later

  Matches by touring teams became more common in the 1970s with England India New Zealand Sri Lanka then not a Test nation all playing a team at this ground Most matches were drawn though England won by the use of two declarations while New Zealand lost against a team with nine players who would appear in the Test series against them An International XI captained by Vanburn Holder also beat a near fullstrength Pakistan here in 1976 though the match did not have international status

  By November 1984 the new Arbab Niaz Stadium in Peshawar was ready and the Club Ground was disused It hosted Peshawar for the last time in their 198687 QuaideAzam Trophy campaign where they played eight home matches and since then the Arbab Niaz has taken over as Peshawars international and first class ground of choice

  Single ODI century has been scored at the venue

  Randamoozham
  Randamoozham  is a 1984 Malayalam novel by Indian author M T Vasudevan Nair widely credited as his masterpiece The work won the Vayalar Award given for the best literary work in Malayalam in 1985 It also won the Muttathu Varkey Award in 1994 The novel has been translated to multiple languages It was translated into English as Second Turn in 1997 Another English translation by Gita Krishnankutty published in 2013 is titled Bhima Lone Warrior

  The novel is a retelling of the Indian epic Mahabharata from the perspective of Bhima the second Pandava The story deviates from the traditional Mahabharata story as it avoids the divine elements of the ancient epic and rerepresent the characters and events realistically One of the reasons critics cite for the novels cult following is its revisionism that was a first time in Malayalam literature The book was translated to Tamil by Kurunjivelan as Irandaam Idam with cover illustration by Trotsky Marudu

  A film adaptation starring Mohanlal is scheduled for 2020 it is set to become Indias most expensive film production at US 155 million and the most expensive nonEnglishlanguage film

  The story begins with the incident of Mahaprasthanika Parva where the Pandavas leave for the pilgrimage to Himalayas forsaking all the worldly possessions The story runs through the eyes of Bhima who faces seemingly severe frustrations as a young man Always destined to be second to his weak elder brother Yudhishthira in seniority and younger brother Arjuna in fame and popularity Bhima is not given his due as the main architect of the Pandava victory over their cousins Kauravas in the Kurukshetra war despite killing all the 100 Kauravas The book unravels all the hardship and dilemmas encountered by Bhima which remain unnoticed The book explores the emotions of the mighty Pandava as a son brother husband and father The book brings to light the affection that he holds for his wife draupadi and how unnoticed his acts of love remains The story questions the mourning of Arjunas son Abhimanyu when he is killed during the battle while trying to break the Chakravyuh formation while Bhimas son Ghatokkach is led to his death by sacrificing his life to save Arjunas life and his sacrifice too remains unsung and everyone enjoys the happiness of saving Arjunas life Towards the end of the book he is shown as the only husband who seems to stop trying to be with darupadi at her last moment during their pilgrimage

  In 2011 director Hariharan announced his plan to adapt Randamoozham to screen scripted by M T Vasudevan Nair himself with Mohanlal cast to play Bhima Later V A Shrikumar Menon took the project again with Mohanlal in the lead it was announced in April 2017 that the film adaptation will be produced by B R Shetty With its 1000 crore 10 billion budget the film is expected to be the most expensive film in Indian cinema and the most expensive nonEnglish language film The film will be shot in two parts The first part is planned to be released in 2020 But in April 2019 it was officially announced that the film adaptation has been shelved

  Xestia
  Xestia is a genus of noctuid moths family Noctuidae They are the type genus of the tribe Xestiini in subfamily Noctuinae though some authors merge this tribe with the Noctuini Species in this genus are commonly known as clays darts or rustics but such names are commonplace among Noctuidae Xestia moths have a wide distribution though they most prominently occur in the Holarctic

  With almost 200 species included at one time Xestia was something of a wastebin genus But almost half of the traditional species are now placed elsewhere see below and some of the remaining ones are liable to be assigned to another genus also On the other hand new moths that probably do belong in this genus are still being discovered eg X hypographa which led to the 2002 transfer of X ornata from Eugraphe to here Thus unless there are drastic taxonomic changes in the future Xestia is likely to remain one of the larger noctuine genera

  Xestia adults are usually of medium size and robust build with stout hairy bodies and strong wings Some are quite colorful with bold lighter markings and hindwings in delicate yellowish reddish or bluish hues Generally they are cryptic while at rest however with unmarked pale or dull brownish hindwings they do not have metallic hues and few species possess obvious eyespots
  This genus includes many species living at high latitudes and altitudes in tundra and taiga ecosystems Some have twoyear semivoltine life cycles and only occur as adults every other year typically the caterpillar larva overwinters to pupate in spring with the moths flying around midsummer but some species eclose later their moths flying from late summer into autumn Xestia caterpillars are generally stout and cryptically colored in some species they have quite prominent dark lengthwise spots but may eg be entirely green or whatever else gives best camouflage

  Some species larvae are notoriously polyphagous eg the setaceous Hebrew character X cnigrum the food of which includes all sorts of core eudicots  including solanaceae and others which are poisonous to many herbivores  as well as some monocots The latter are mainly Poaceae however and few other monocots are utilized by Xestia larvae in general Ericaceae as well as Betulaceae and Poaceae are key food plants for many of the highlatitude species Gymnosperms are food plants of secondary importance in this genus but Pinaceae form the mainstay or exclusive food of some species which occasionally become more than nuisance pests Altogether Xestia moths are only known as major pests within limited areas or in regard to specific plants in which cases damage can be economically significant though

  Even though the larval food plants of many Xestia species are not or insufficiently known those on record are from all major lineages of core eudicots Among the basal core eudicots Caryophyllales especially Polygonaceae are particularly significant of the asterids the Asterales especially Asteraceae Ericales especially Ericaceae and Lamiales especially Plantaginaceae and of the rosids the Malpighiales numerous families and Rosales especially Rosaceae Less important asterid orders among Xestia food plants are for example Dipsacales Gentianales and Solanales of the rosids eg Fabales Fagales Malvales Myrtales and Sapindales More basal mesangiosperms do not seem to be significant as Xestia food plants at least not in temperate and cooler regions

  As far as is known Xestia adults are nocturnal or crepuscular except of course the highlatitude species but are often attracted to lights at night They general feed on flowers with relatively short or no corolla and will also drink other sugary liquids

  Several species formerly placed here are now in Agnorisma and Pseudohermonassa whether other genera are accepted varies among authors Estimata Hemigraphiphora and Perinaenia are provisionally considered distinct here Xestia versuta does not seem to belong in the present genus it may be an aberrant member of Goniographa but until this is resolved it is here treated under its original name Eugraphe versuta

  Furthermore a case for separation has in particular been made for Amathes possibly including Agrotiphila Lytaea Megasema possibly including Megarhomba Segetia and Schoyenia with Archanarta occasionally also separate but these are here included in Xestia Some of them are however recognized as subgenera and if the genus is split further would be first to become elevated in rank again There is no real good justification for either treatment except that the lengthy process of a thorough revision of noctuine systematics and taxonomy has only progressed so far H Beck in 1996 published a comprehensive taxonomic catalogue introducing generic names for most European groups of presumably related species While few of these seem to stand any chance ever to be widely recognized as distinct genera this step is likely to have made available a generic name for any taxa that are eventually split from Xestia sensu stricto

  Junior synonyms and other obsolete generic names for Xestia moths are
  The 110 or so species here placed in Xestia are divided among five subgenera Two of these are further divided into groups which are based on phenetic similarity however and may or may not form clades andor species complexes Some of these would presumably warrant recognition as subgenera if the presentday subgenera are split off the subgeneric names that would apply are given if known in the addition to the speciesgroup names

  About onethird of the species here included in Xestia are incertae sedis of unclear assignment Among this group are a few species which are extremely little known having been described long ago but studied only once or twice since then

  If the affiliations of the subgenera are not very much mistaken most remaining cases of erroneous assignment to Xestia are to be found among the species of uncertain group affiliation here for the recently described X kecskerago for example it was explicitly stated that placement in the present genus is tentative Other species of unclear affiliation are so little known that even their validity remains questionable though this group equally well seems to contain quite distinct lineages of true Xestia Also there are some obvious species groups which do not easily fit into the subgeneric scheme above

  Aethia
  Aethia is a genus of four small 85300g auklets endemic to the North Pacific Ocean Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk and among some of North Americas most abundant seabirds The relationships between the four true auklets remains unclear Auklets are threatened by invasive species such as Arctic foxes Alopex lagopus and Norway rats Rattus norvegicus because of their high degree of coloniality and crevicenesting

  The genus Aethia occurs only in the North Pacific and adjacent waters mainly in the Bering Sea region Along with Cassins auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus they comprise the monophyletic tribe Aethinii Molecular work has not yet resolved the relationship between the Aethia auklets but the group is a sister group to Cassins auklet which is in turn a sister group to the Fraterculine auks puffins and rhinoceros auklet

  The genus Aethia did not enter into widespread use until the 1960s Initially the auklets were placed in Alca but later reorganized into genera including Simorhynchus Phaleris and Cyclorhynchus Cyclorhynchus is still occasionally used for the parakeet auklet

  The first undisputed auk fossils are from the middle Miocene 15 million years ago The first Aethia fossils date from the late Miocene 813 million years ago and the four extant species likely diverged rapidly about 5 million years ago

  There are one or two fossil species which lived in the area of todays California during the Late Miocene some 5 million years ago Aethia rossmoori Howard 1968 Monterrey Formation of Orange Countyand an undescribed taxon tentatively placed in this genus
  From the Pliocene there are Aethia barnesi N A Smith 2013 San Mateo Formation of San Diego County California and Aethia storeri N A Smith 2013 San Mateo Formation of San Diego County California

  There are four species of Aethia
  Censusing breeding auklets can be difficult because they nest in hidden crevices At present population estimates are

  Aethia auklets are endemic to the North Pacific Ocean and Sea of Okhotsk with notable Asian colonies in the Kuril Islands Commander Islands along the Kamchatka and Chukota Peninsulas In North America large colonies are in the Aleutian Islands Buldir Kiska Semisopochnoi and Gareloi to the Gulf of Alaska and north to the islands of the Bering Sea St Lawrence Island Pribilof Islands St Matthew Island

  Auklets have high site fidelity at both the colony and crevice level although there can be a high divorce rate of up to 33 in least and crested auklets when both mates survive

  Winter distribution of auklets is poorly known Whiskered auklets likely winter near to breeding colonies and many were reported by Aleuts to winter in the general area Auklets from the northern Bering Sea must move further south because of pack ice surrounding colonies during the winter

  Auklets are typically very social and nest in dense colonies Parakeet auklets are more dispersed All have some form of facial ornamentation such as large crests Whiskered and crested auklets auricular plumes all four species and crested and whiskered auklets have a tangerinescented odour which may function in mate choice or species recognition although this requires more study

  All Aethia auklets lay one white egg in a natural crevice and incubate for 2536 days after which a semiprecocial chick emerges and fledges after 2535 days Age at first breeding is estimated at 35 years Colony sizes are highly variable and range from less than 100 individuals to over 1 million although least and crested auklets tend to nest in greater density than parakeet and whiskered auklets

  The auklets are mainly planktivores eating a variety of calanoid copepods euphausiids and other invertebrates such as jellyfish and ctenophores Winter diet has not been studied

  Because they nest in crevices auklets are vulnerable to predation by rats and have been extirpated from some islands that contained Arctic foxes introduced for farming Eradication of rats from Rat Island was completed in 2008 and 2009

  The large colony at Sirius Point Kiska Island Alaska perhaps the largest auklet colony in the world experienced almost complete breeding failure in 2001 and 2002 because of rat predation and disturbance and has been the focus of researchers at Memorial University of Newfoundland

  Peter Ilsted
  Peter Ilsted 14 February 1861  16 April 1933 was a leading Danish artist and printmaker He was most associated with domestic interior scenes
  Peter Vilhelm Ilsted was born at Sakskbing in Guldborgsund Denmark He was the son of merchant Jens Peter Ilsted and Johanne Sophie Lund He was the brotherinlaw of painter Vilhelm Hammershi 18641916 He married Ingeborg Lovisa Petersen 18691945 in 1891

  He came to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1878 completing his course of study in five years He made his debut at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1883 Two years later he joined a study trip across Italy to Egypt Palestine Greece and Turkey Later he visited Scotland England Holland Belgium Spain Morocco and France With support from the Cultural Ministry he traveled to the Exposition Universelle 1889 in Paris He was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1890 and 1899 He became an assistant at the Royal Danish Academy from 18931905 and worked periodically as a conservatorrestorer Ilsted died in Copenhagen during 1933

  Peter Ilsted and Vilhelm Hammershi together with Carl Holse 18631935 were leading artists in early 20thcentury Denmark All three artists were members of the Free Exhibitions Den Frie Udstilling a progressive artists association founded in 1891 They are famous for painting images of Sunshine and Silent Rooms all in subtle colors Their works reflect the orderliness of a tranquil life  similar to the earlier works of Vermeer Their art was later referred to as the Copenhagen Interior School These interiors evoke at once a sense of calm and mystery The orderly rooms are often viewed from behindcausing one to wonder whether the scenes are really tranquil James McNeill Whistler Duret and important art critics were early admirers and collectors of Ilsteds works
  While at first glance their work appears similar Ilsted and Hammershi were in fact quite different Hammershis work has an aloof austerity in contrast to Ilsteds scenes of common life Though sometimes Hammershis colorful early pictures are reminiscent of James Tissot 18361902 his work is quintessentially Danish However Ilsted was more of a technician and he made considerable contributions in the field of graphic arts Ilsteds mezzotints sometimes printed in colour  la poupe were very popular and important in his day They were an innovation in the media Ilsted exhibited his work all over Europe in London in 1907 in Germany and at the Paris Salon where Europes art community was first exposed to his work

  Ilsted was a great success in his lifetime and won many awards and accolades for his work He was the only member of the group to also focus on printmaking Ilsteds achievements in mezzotints were revolutionary Some of his mezzotints most of which were created in black as well as color editions are considered among the greatest ever made His greatest contribution which T F imon 1871942 Manuel Robbe 1872 1936 and others seemingly adopted was that of inking the plate  la poupe Some art historians have argued that these three men created the technique at about the same time but without consultation This is uncertain

  Weather buoy
  Weather buoys are instruments which collect weather and ocean data within the worlds oceans as well as aid during emergency response to chemical spills legal proceedings and engineering design Moored buoys have been in use since 1951 while drifting buoys have been used since 1979 Moored buoys are connected with the ocean bottom using either chains nylon or buoyant polypropylene With the decline of the weather ship they have taken a more primary role in measuring conditions over the open seas since the 1970s During the 1980s and 1990s a network of buoys in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean helped study the El NioSouthern Oscillation Moored weather buoys range from in diameter while drifting buoys are smaller with diameters of  Drifting buoys are the dominant form of weather buoy in sheer number with 1250 located worldwide Wind data from buoys has smaller error than that from ships There are differences in the values of sea surface temperature measurements between the two platforms as well relating to the depth of the measurement and whether or not the water is heated by the ship which measures the quantity

  The first known proposal for surface weather observations at sea occurred in connection with aviation in August 1927 when Grover Loening stated that weather stations along the ocean coupled with the development of the seaplane to have an equally long range would result in regular ocean flights within ten years Starting in 1939 United States Coast Guard vessels were being used as weather ships to protect transatlantic air commerce

  During World War II The German Navy deployed weather buoys Wetterfunkgert See  WFS at fifteen fixed positions in the North Atlantic and Barents Sea They were launched from Uboats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms 1800 metres limited by the length of the anchor cable Overall height of the body was 105 metres of which most was submerged surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres Data air and water temperature atmospheric pressure and relative humidity were encoded and transmitted four times a day When the batteries high voltage drycells for the valves and nickeliron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast were exhausted after about eight to ten weeks the unit selfdestructed

  The Navy Oceanographic Meteorological Automatic Device NOMAD buoys hull was originally designed in the 1940s for the United States Navys offshore data collection program The United States Navy tested marine automatic weather stations for hurricane conditions between 1956 and 1958 though radio transmission range and battery life was limited Between 1951 and 1970 a total of 21NOMAD buoys were built and deployed at sea Since the 1970s weather buoy use has superseded the role of weather ships as they are cheaper to operate and maintain The earliest reported use of drifting buoys was to study the behavior of ocean currents within the Sargasso Sea in 1972 and 1973 Drifting buoys have been used increasingly since 1979 and as of 2005 1250drifting buoys roamed the Earths oceans

  Between 1985 and 1994 an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean to monitor and help predict the El Nio phenomenon Hurricane Katrina capsized a buoy for the first time in the history of the National Data Buoy Center NDBC on August 28 2005 On June 13 2006 drifting buoy 26028 ended its longterm data collection of sea surface temperature after transmitting for 10years 4months and 16days which is the longest known data collection time for any drifting buoy The first weather buoy in the Southern Ocean was deployed by the Integrated Marine Observing System IMOS on March 17 2010

  Weather buoys like other types of weather stations measure parameters such as air temperature above the ocean surface wind speed steady and gusting barometric pressure and wind direction Since they lie in oceans and lakes they also measure water temperature wave height and dominant wave period Raw data is processed and can be logged on board the buoy and then transmitted via radio cellular or satellite communications to meteorological centers for use in weather forecasting and climate study Both moored buoys and drifting buoys drifting in the open ocean currents are used Fixed buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of  Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution Other than their use as a source of meteorological data their data is used within research programs emergency response to chemical spills legal proceedings and engineering design Moored weather buoys can also act as a navigational aid like other types of buoys

  Weather buoys range in diameter from  Those that are placed in shallow waters are smaller in size and moored using only chains while those in deeper waters use a combination of chains nylon and buoyant polypropylene Since they do not have direct navigational significance moored weather buoys are classed as special marks under the IALA scheme are coloured yellow and display a yellow flashing light at night

  Discus buoys are round and moored in deep ocean locations with a diameter of  The aluminum buoy is a very rugged meteorological ocean platform that has long term survivability The expected service life of the platform is in excess of 20years and properly maintained these buoys have not been retired due to corrosion The NOMAD is a unique moored aluminum environmental monitoring buoy designed for deployments in extreme conditions near the coast and across the Great Lakes NOMADs moored off the Atlantic Canadian coast commonly experience winter storms with maximum wave heights approaching into the Gulf of Maine

  A large network of coastal buoys near the United States is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center with deployment and maintenance performed by the United States Coast Guard For South Africa the South African Weather Service deploys and retrieves their own buoys while the Meteorological Service of New Zealand performs the same task for their country Environment Canada operates and deploys buoys for their country The Met Office in Great Britain deploys drifting buoys across both the northern and southern Atlantic oceans

  Wind reports from moored buoys have smaller error than those from ships Complicating the comparison of the two measurements are that NOMAD buoys report winds at a height of  while ships report winds from a height of  Sea surface temperature measured in the intake port of large ships have a warm bias of around due to the heat of the engine room This bias has led to changes in the perception of global warming since 2000 Fixed buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of

  Brothers Grimm comics
  The Brothers Grimm are two sets of fictional twin supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics

  The first appearance of the first Brothers Grimm came in SpiderWoman 3 These were a pair of identical magically animated mannequins created by doll collector Nathan Dolly also known as Mister Doll and his wife Priscilla During their initial appearances only one was ever seen at a time and the singular identity Brother Grimm was used instead of their true plural name After three return appearances in SpiderWoman they perished in issue 12 Though the characters were introduced while Marv Wolfman was writing SpiderWoman their origin and identities were not revealed until Mark Gruenwalds run on the series Questioned as to whether he had told Gruenwald the characters origin or Gruenwald had come up with it himself Wolfman admitted that he could not even remember if the origin he had originally envisioned for the characters was the same as the one ultimately used by Gruenwald except that Brother Grimm actually being two people was his intention from the beginning Though Wolfman could not remember how the Brothers Grimm were created he has said he is confident that their visual design must have come from series penciler Carmine Infantino I usually gave the artist a concept of what I wanted and then let them have a field day with it Carmine created brilliant designs in The Flash so I would certainly have bowed to his expertise

  The second Brothers Grimm appeared in Iron Man 188 They would eventually be thrown together with other lesser known supervillains in a group called the Night Shift

  Mister Doll was a criminal who could mystically harm a person by harming a doll whose features he could reshape to resemble the victims Later in the process of creating the Brothers Grimm dolls Nathans consciousness was trapped simultaneously inside both doll mannequins These mannequins mailed themselves to Nathans wife Priscilla and transferred their life forces into two life size versions She named them Jake and William after the historical Brothers Grimm and believed them to be her sons a delusion which they played along with

  The brothers had sharply opposed personalities rarely could come to agreement and as such pursued separate criminal careers William though timid and shy in his civilian personality was a flamboyant confrontational jokester in his Brother Grimm guise After debuting with a robbery of a theatre he pursued the more lucrative pursuit of stealing from diamond merchants In contrast Jake was flirtatious in his civilian identity but cold and dispassionate as Brother Grimm preferring less publicly visible crimes such as extortion He was also less skilled with his abilities than William while William was able to consistently defeat SpiderWoman Jake was defeated in both his confrontations with her and William had to free him from prison William was later hired by Pyrotechnics to capture SpiderWoman and succeeded

  Priscilla planned to use her occult knowledge to transfer Nathans mind from the mannequins to a living human body To this end Jake abducted Jerry Hunt to use for the body and William captured SpiderWoman to coerce Magnus the Sorcerer to perform the transfer SpiderWoman pulled Hunt out of the spell at the last moment and Nathans consciousness dispersed

  Twin brothers Percy and Barton Grimes are born in Fresno California They work as realtors and while exploring a theatre they own they find the original Brothers Grimm mannequins On a whim they decide to try the costumes on and become gifted with the powers of the original pair As the Brothers Grimm they terrorize a restaurant belonging to a business rival and then battle Iron Man II Tony Stark deduced their true civilian identities and the police arrested the brothers

  The Brothers Grimm later became professional criminals and join the Night Shift and team with Captain America against the Power Broker and his augmented mutates With the rest of the Night Shift the Brothers test Moon Knight to take over as their leader Alongside the Night Shift they next battle the West Coast Avengers The Brothers Grimm are among a large group of supervillains who attack Hawkeye Mockingbird and Trick Shot in an attempt to collect the reward being paid by Crossfire to the first person who gives him Hawkeyes arm

  During the Acts of Vengeance storyline the Brothers Grimm are freed from prison by the Wizard They battle a cosmicpowered SpiderMan and are defeated Alongside Graviton Titania Trapster and Goliath IV the Brothers are hired by the Chameleon to kill SpiderMan They are then tricked into attacking the Kingpin and defeated by SpiderMan Alongside Mockingbird and the Werewolf they help the Shroud defeat a street gang

  The Brothers then briefly rejoin the Night Shift under the leadership of the new Hangman and the Night Shifts powers are increased by Satannish They battle the Avengers West Coast again but are defeated

  The Brothers are later depicted as prisoners in the Raft a high security prison for costumed criminals and escape

  The Brothers Grimm are later hired by the Hood to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act They are later captured by Nighthawk and Gargoyle and sent back to jail

  In Secret Invasion the Brothers Grimm appear as part of the Hoods alliance with superpowered heroes the grouping is intent on defeating the Skrull invasion force of New York City They are later seen as part of the Hoods criminal gang that is sent by Norman Osborn to attack the New Avengers

  The Brothers Grimm are seen to be among the new recruits for Camp HAMMER Tigra beats Percy severely and leaves a note for his brother reading Youre next

  The Brothers Grimm were seen during the battle of Camp HAMMER until the Hood ordered his men including the Brothers Grimm to teleport to aid Osborn in Siege of Asgard After the battle was over the Brothers Grimm were arrested along with other members of the Hoods gang

  The Brothers Grimm were later recruited by Max Fury to join the Shadow Councils incarnation of the Masters of Evil

  The Brothers Grimm were among the criminals who attempted to fulfill a lucrative contract Daredevil put out on himself but were quickly defeated by him

  During the Search for Tony Stark arc the Brothers Grimm rejoined Hoods gang and assisted in the attack on Castle Doom

  During the SpiderGeddon storyline the Brothers Grimm are with Night Shift members Dansen Macabre Digger Skein and new member Waxman when they rob a bus until they are attacked by Superior Octopus Superior Octopus agrees to spare them more pain in exchange that the Night Shift becomes his agents where he will compensate them from his own funds They agree to the terms and are ordered to return the stolen items Superior Octopus leaves advising them never to cross him or they wont live long enough to regret it

  Both pairs of Brothers Grimm had powers which were somehow related to the Brothers Grimm mannequins built by Nathan Dolly Both pairs of Brothers Grimm possess the ability to conjure with the appearance of sleight of hand a variety of small novelty items from within their costumes Each of these items has a unique offensive capability long strands of nearly unbreakable thread corrosive filled eggs pies filled with blackbirds paralytic stardust fastgrowing bean seeds and many others have been used They could also emit poisonous smoke from their hands They could fly by means of floating fivepointed stars and small cloud banks which are somehow solid enough to stand on

  ClaiborneAnnapolis Ferry Company
  The ClaiborneAnnapolis Ferry Company ran both passenger and automobile ferry service across the Chesapeake Bay from 1919 to 1952 The initial service was between Annapolis Maryland on the western shore and Claiborne Maryland on the eastern shore In July 1930 a second shorter route was added between Annapolis Maryland and Matapeake on Kent Island Maryland Business increased so rapidly at that point that another ferryboat was added In May 1938 the Claiborne route was changed to run from Claiborne to Romancoke Maryland on the lower end of Kent Island from which passengers could then connect to the Matapeake to Annapolis run In 1943 the Annapolis United States Naval Academy absorbed the property where the ferry terminal had been so service was switched from Annapolis to a new terminal at Sandy Point on the western shore By May 1951 the ferries were handling 1 million vehicles and 2 million passengers annually Ferry service stopped running in 1952 when the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was completed

  The first ClaiborneAnnapolis run was June 19 1919 with the sidewheeler Gov Emerson C Harrington named for the 48th Governor of Maryland and later President of the ClaiborneAnnapolis Ferry Company As governor Harrington had been instrumental in getting the ferry started In 1915 the State Roads Commission had appropriated 50000 to establish a stateowned ferry With the beginning of World War I planning was put on hold until 1919 At that time a group of businessmen headed by J P Mehaham of St Louis and Frank McNamee of Albany and at the urging of Gov Harrington formed a private company named the ClaiborneAnnapolis Ferry Inc The state funds were instead diverted toward subsidizing the new private company The Old Harrington as the boat became known made two round trips daily crossing the Chesapeake Bay in 1 hour 20 minutes

  In 1921 the company was in bankruptcy but Gov Harrington his term as Governor over became President of the company and instituted reforms to make it more profitable Not until 1924 did the company begin to see receipts exceed expenses In 1921 a bus route was added to carry passengers to Easton Hurlock and Cambridge In 1928 the company was reorganized and renamed the ClaiborneAnnapolis Ferry Company

  The Gov Emerson C Harrington was retired in 1937 and replaced by the Gov Harry W Nice a doubleender which could hold up to 68 cars Other boats were to include the General Lincoln Majestic Albert C Ritchie John M Dennis Gov Harry W Nice Gov Emerson C Harrington II Governor Herbert R OConor and the B Frank Sherman the last named for the companys General Manager from 19241952

  Serious discussion about building a bridge across the Chesapeake Bay had been around since at least 1907 but did not take hold until the 1930s Since the bridge would put the ferry out of business the State decided it had an obligation to the ferry owners to purchase the company In 1941 the company was purchased for 1023000 by the Maryland State Roads Commission now the Maryland State Highway Administration and was renamed the Chesapeake Bay Ferry System

  At the time the company was purchased by the State Roads Commission it had approximately 120 employees

  Service on the ferry was continued across the Chesapeake Bay until July 30 1952 the same day the new Chesapeake Bay Bridge was opened During a final run by the John M Dennis a few weeks before the bridge opening it accidentally rammed the new bridge Variations on the cause of the accident can be found between newspaper accounts and recollections by family members of the ships Captain Edward C Higgins The last run from Claiborne to Romancoke was on December 31 1952 by the Gov Emerson C Harrington II

  Karaganov is known as the progenitor of the Karaganov Doctrine which states that Moscow should pose as the defender of human rights of ethnic Russians living in the near abroad for the purpose of gaining political influence in these regions After Karaganov published an article advocating this stance in 1992 Russias foreign policy position linked Russian troop withdrawals from the Baltics with the end of systemic discrimination against Russians in these countries

  In addition to his Doctrine Karaganov has advocated for a united SinoRussian strategy to unify a Eurasian bloc He argues that the Eurasian Economic Union EEU and Chinas One Belt One Road Initiative OBOR will work together to promote economic integration throughout the region Many experts disagree with this judgement claiming that China as a far more powerful economy will simply dominate this Eurasian bloc This would counter Russian ambitions to regain their foothold as a global power

  Penalty shot
  A penalty shot or kick is a play used in several sports whereby a goal is attempted during untimed play Depending on the sport when a player commits certain types of penalties the opposition is awarded a penalty shot or kick attempt The rules on how a player attempts a penalty shot or kick also varies between sports

  Penalty shots or kicks are sometimes grouped into the larger penalty shootout which is used as a tiebreaker to decide games in several sports

  In association football a penalty kick is awarded to the opponent when a direct free kick foul has been committed by a team within its own penalty area The shot is taken from the penalty mark which is from the goal line and centred between the touch line while the goal is defended only by the opposing teams goalkeeper If the match is tied after 90min of regulation and 30min of extra time a penalty shootout is used to determine the winner Penalties are taken from the spot but no rebounds are allowed

  A penalty shot is awarded to the fouled team in bandy following a foul usually punishable by a freeshot but that has occurred within their opponents penalty area

  The situations when a penalty shot is to be made is stated in Rule 14 of the Bandy Playing Rules published by the Federation of International Bandy The execution of a penalty shot is regulated in Rule 15

  If a match is at a draw at full time a penalty shot competition can be arranged in order to determine a winning team either after an extension of the match which still is at a draw or instead of an extension This is regulated in Rule 16

  In Gaelic football a penalty kick may be awarded if a defender commits a foul within the large rectangle enclosing the goal The penalty kick is taken from the ground from the centre of the 11m line Only the goalkeeper may guard the goals

  In ice hockey a penalty shot is awarded to a player in a good shooting position denied a chance at a goal by the foul of an opponent All players are required to leave the ice rink as the player who got fouled faces off solely against the goaltender of the opposite team The puck is placed at the center of the ice rink as the player has twenty seconds to retrieve the puck and attempt to score a goal against the goaltender The penalty shot ends as soon as the puck either crosses the goal line is blocked by the goaltender stops moving moves in the opposite direction of the goal line or if the shooter loses possession of the puck

  Penalty shots are awarded

  If a side commits a penalty infringement the opposition can take the option of a place kick at goal from where the infringement occurred A successful penalty kick is worth two points in rugby league and three points in rugby union

  A penalty shot or throw is awarded when a defender commits a major foul within the five meter area that prevents a likely goal

  In field hockey a penalty stroke or a penalty corner is awarded after a foul

  Free throws are the equivalent of the penalty shot in basketball free throws are much more common than penalty shots in other sports due to the much higher rate of scoring in that game

  Gridiron football does not have any sort of explicit equivalent to the penalty shot scenarios where an illegal act deprived someone of a score are handled through the unfair act clause which allows officials the right to assess any penalty they see fit including awarding the score automatically

  Persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia
  The Persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia also known as the Genocide of the Serbs   Genocid nad Srbima included the extermination expulsion and forced religious conversion of hundreds of thousands ethnic Serbs by the genocidal policies of the Ustashe regime in the Independent State of Croatia NDH between 1941 and 1945 during World War II The Ustashe regime systematically murdered approximately 300000 to 500000 Serbs out of whom up to 52000 died at the Jasenovac concentration camp according to current estimates

  Ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs can be traced back to the Great Schism of 1054 During the time of the Austrian Empire many Croats came to resent the privileges granted to Serbs living in the Military Frontier of the Habsburg Monarchy Following the collapse of AustriaHungary in the final days of World War I the Croat and Slovenedominated State of Slovenes Croats and Serbs was established Having fought on the side of the Central Powers during the war ethnic Croats and Slovenes  who formed the majority of the states population  were viewed unfavourably by western nations and as such they failed to gain recognition from the Great Powers This left them no choice but to join a union largely dominated by ethnic Serbs which came to be known as the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes Upon its creation the state was composed of six million Serbs 35 million Croats and 1 million Slovenes Being the largest ethnic group the Serbs favoured a centralized state whereas Croats Slovenes and Bosnian Muslims did not

  Approved on 28 June 1921 and based on the Serbian constitution of 1903 the socalled Vidovdan Constitution established the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes as a parliamentary monarchy under the Serbian Karaorevi dynasty Belgrade was chosen as the capital of the new state assuring Serb and Orthodox Christian political dominance In 1928 Croatian Peasant Party HSS leader Stjepan Radi was assassinated on the floor of the countrys parliament by a Montenegrin Serb leader and Peoples Radical Party NRS politician Punia Rai The following year King Alexander I proclaimed the 6 January Dictatorship and renamed his country the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to deemphasize its ethnic makeup Yugoslavia was divided into nine administrative units called banovinas six of which had ethnic Serb majorities In 1931 the king issued a decree which allowed the Yugoslav Parliament to reconvene on the condition that only proYugoslav parties were allowed to be represented in it Marginalized farright and farleft movements thrived The Ustae a Croatian fascist party emerged as the most extreme movement of these The Ustae were driven by a deep hatred of Serbs and Serbdom and claimed that Croats and Serbs were separated by an unbridgable cultural gulf which prevented them from ever living alongside each other They organized the socalled Velebit uprising in 1932 assaulting a police station in the village of Bruani in Lika The police responded harshly to the assault and harassed the local population In 1934 the Ustae cooperated with Bulgarian Hungarian and Italian rightwing extremists to assassinate Alexander while he visited the French city of Marseille Alexanders cousin Prince Paul took the regency until Alexanders son Peter II turned eighteen Ustae leader Ante Paveli believed that the assassination would cause Yugoslavia to disintegrate Instead countries that had assisted the organization such as Italy and Hungary cracked down on its members arrested them and destroyed their training camps at Yugoslavias behest According to historian Slavko Goldstein the Ustae planned to commit a genocide against ethnic Serbs for years prior to the outbreak of World War II One of Pavelis main ideologues Mijo Babi wrote in 1932

  Croatian opposition to a centralized Yugoslavia continued following Alexanders assassination culminating with the signing of the CvetkoviMaek Agreement by Croatian politician Vladko Maek and Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragia Cvetkovi on 26 August 1939 By signing the agreement Belgrade sought to accommodate moderate Croats through the creation of a largely autonomous Banovina of Croatia which covered 27 percent of Yugoslavias territory and included 29 percent of its population It also ensured that Maek became Yugoslavias deputy premier Ultimately the agreement was not successfulit led to other Yugoslav ethnic groups demanding a status similar to that of Croatia and failed to satisfy rightwing Croats such as those that had joined the Ustae who wanted a fully independent Croatian state The Ustae were enraged by the very notion of Maek having negotiated with Belgrade denouncing him as a sell out Rightwing Croats quickly orchestrated antiSerbian incidents across the newly formed Banovina and in June 1940 a Croatian NationalSocialist Party was established in Zagreb On 25 March 1941 Yugoslavia bowed to German pressure and signed the Tripartite Pact in an effort to avoid war with the Axis powers Two days later a group of Serbian nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers organized a coup dtat to depose Prince Paul and the government of Dragia Cvetkovi Peter was declared to be of age and was elevated to the throne Upon hearing news of the coup Adolf Hitler immediately ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia

  In April 1941 the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers and the puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia NDH was created ruled by the Ustae regime The ideology of the Ustae movement was a blend of Nazism Catholicism and Croatian ultranationalism The Ustae supported the creation of a Greater Croatia that would span to the Drina river and the outskirts of Belgrade The movement emphasized the need for a racially pure Croatia and promoted the extermination of Serbs who were viewed as ethinic foreigners Jews and Gypsies

  A major ideological influence on the Croatian nationalism of the Ustae was the 19thcentury nationalist Ante Starevi Starevi was an advocate of Croatian unity and independence and was both antiHabsburg and antiSerb He envisioned the creation of a Greater Croatia that would include territories inhabited by Bosniaks Serbs and Slovenes considering Bosniaks and Serbs to be Croats who had been converted to Islam and Eastern Orthodox Christianity and considering the Slovenes to be mountain Croats

  Starevi argued that the large Serb presence in the territories that were claimed by a Greater Croatia was the result of recent settlement which had been encouraged by the Habsburg rulers along with the influx of groups like Vlachs who took up Eastern Orthodox Christianity and identified themselves as Serbs The Ustae used Starevis theories to promote the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia and they recognized Croatia as having two major ethnocultural components Catholic Croats and Muslim Croats because the Ustae saw the Islam of the BosnianMuslims as a religion which keeps true the blood of Croats Armed struggle genocide and terrorism were glorified by the group Alexander Korb wrote


  After Nazi forces entered into Zagreb on April 10 1941 Pavelis closest associate Slavko Kvaternik proclaimed the formation of the Independent State of Croatia NDH on a Radio Zagreb broadcast Meanwhile Paveli and several hundred Ustae volunteers left their camps in Italy and travelled to Zagreb where Paveli declared a new government on 16 April 1941 He accorded himself the title of Poglavnik   The Independent State of Croatia was declared to be on Croatian ethnic and historical territory

  The NDH combined most of modern Croatia all of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern Serbia into an ItalianGerman quasiprotectorate NDH authorities led by the Ustae militia then implemented genocidal policies against the Serb Jewish and Romani populations living in the new state The Ustashe cruelty and sadism shocked even Nazi commanders

  Viktor Guti made several speeches in early summer 1941 calling Serbs former enemies and unwanted elements to be cleansed and destroyed and also threatened Croats who did not support their cause

  In 1941 the usage of the Cyrillic script was banned and in June 1941 began the elimination of Eastern Serbian words from the Croatian language as well as the shutting down of Serbian schools Ante Paveli ordered through the Croatian state office for language the creation of new words from old roots some which are used today and purged many Serbian words

  In the summer of 1941 Ustashe militias and death squads burnt villages and killed thousands of civilian Serbs in the countryside in sadistic ways with various weapons and tools Men women children were hacked to death thrown alive into pits and down ravines or set on fire in churches Some Serb villages near Srebrenica and Ozren were wholly massacred while children were found impaled by stakes in villages between Vlasenica and Kladanj

  A large number of massacres were committed by the Ustashe Some of the more notable ones were

  The Ustashe set up temporary concentration camps in the spring of 1941 and laid the groundwork for a network of permanent camps in autumn The creation of concentration camps and extermination campaign of Serbs had been planned by the Ustashe leadership long before 1941 In Ustashe state exhibits in Zagreb the camps were portrayed as productive and peaceful work camps with photographs of smiling inmates Croatia was the only Axis satellite to have erected camps specifically for children

  Serbs Jews and Romani were arrested and sent to concentration camps such as Jasenovac Stara Gradika Gospi and Jadovno There were 2226 camps in NDH in total Special camps for children were those at Sisak Gornja Rijeka and Jastrebarsko while Stara Gradika held thousands of children and women

  The largest and most notorious camp was the JasenovacStara Gradika complex the largest extermination camp in the Balkans An estimated 100000 inmates perished there most Serbs Vjekoslav Maks Luburi the commanderinchief of all the Croatian camps announced the great efficiency of the Jasenovac camp at a ceremony on 9 October 1942 and also boasted We have slaughtered here at Jasenovac more people than the Ottoman Empire was able to do during its occupation of Europe
  Bounded by rivers and two barbedwire fences making escape unlikely the Jasenovac camp was divided into five camps the first two closed in December 1941 while the rest were active until the end of the war Stara Gradika Jasenovac V held women and children The Ciglana brickyards Jasenovac III camp the main killing ground and essentially a death camp had 88 mortality rate higher than Auschwitzs 846 A former brickyard a furnace was engineered into a crematorium with witness testimony of some including children being burnt alive and stench of human flesh spreading in the camp Luburi had a gas chamber built at Jasenovac V where a considerable number of inmates were killed during a threemonth experiment with sulfur dioxide and Zyklon B but this method was abandoned due to poor construction Still that method was unnecessary as most inmates perished from starvation disease especially typhus assaults with mallets maces axes poison and knives The srbosjek Serbcutter was a glove with an attached curved blade designed to cut throats Large groups of people were regularly executed upon arrival outside camps and thrown into the river Unlike Germanrun camps Jasenovac specialized in brutal oneonone violence such as guards attacking barracks with weapons and throwing the bodies in the trenches The infamous camp commander Filipovi dubbed fra Sotona brother Satan and the personification of evil on one occasion drowned Serb women and children by flooding a cellar Filipovi and other camp commanders such as Dinko aki and his wife  the sister of Maks Luburi used ingenious torture There were throatcutting contests of Serbs in which prison guards made bets among themselves as to who could slaughter the most inmates It was reported that guard and former Franciscan priest Petar Brzica won a contest on 29 August 1942 after cutting the throats of 1360 inmates Inmates were tied and hit over the head with mallets and halfalive hung in groups by the Granik ramp crane their intestines and necks slashed then dropped into the river When the Partisans and Allies closed in at the end of the war the Ustashe began mass liquidations at Jasenovac marching women and children to death and shooting most of the remaining male inmates then torched buildings and documents before fleeing

  The Ustashe viewed religion and nationality as closely linked while Roman Catholicism and Islam Bosnian Muslims were viewed as Croats were recognized as Croatian national religions Eastern Orthodoxy was deemed inherently incompatible with the Croatian state project They saw Orthodoxy as hostile because it was identified as Serb On 3 May 1941 a law was passed on religious conversions pressuring Serbs to convert to Catholicism and thereby adopt Croat identity This was made on the eve of Pavelis meeting with Pope Pious XII in Rome The Catholic Church in Croatia headed by archbishop Aloysius Stepinac greeted it and adopted it into the Church internal law The term Serbian Orthodox was banned in midMay as uncompatible with state order and substituted it with GreekEastern faith By the end of September 1941 about half of the Serbian Orthodox clergy 335 priests had been expelled

  Ustashe propaganda legitimized persecution partly based on historical CatholicOrthodox struggle for domination in Europe and Catholic intolerance towards the schismatics Following Serb insurgency provoked by Ustashe terror killing and deportation campaign the State Directorate for Regeneration launched a program in the autumn of 1941 aimed at mass forced conversion of Serbs Already in the summer the Ustashe had closed or destroyed most of the Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries and deported imprisoned or murdered Orthodox priests and bishops The conversions were meant to Croatianize and permanently destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church The Vatican was not opposed to the forced conversions On 6 February 1942 Pope Pious XII privately received 206 Ustashes in uniforms and blessed them giving symbolical support to their acts On 8 February 1942 envoy to the Holy See Rusinovi said that the Holy See joyed over forced conversions Cardinal Luigi Maglione the Holy See secretary encouraged the Croatian bishops in a 21 February 1942 letter to speed up the conversions and also stressed that the Orthodox term be replaced with terms apostates or schismatics Many fanatic Catholic priests joined the Ustashe blessed and supported their work and participated in killings and conversions

  In 194142 some 200000 or 240000250000 Serbs were converted to Roman Catholicism although most temporarily Converts would sometimes be killed anyway often in the same churches they were rebaptized 85 of the Serbian Orthodox clergy was killed or expelled In Lika Kordun and Banija alone 172 Serbian Orthodox churches were closed destroyed or plundered On 2 July 1942 the Croatian Orthodox Church was founded in order to replace the institutions of the Serbian Orthodox Church after the matter of forced conversion had become extremely controversial

  Many Catholic bishops and priests in Croatia openly supported the Ustashe actions and also there were no condemnations of the crimes public or private by the Catholic hierarchy The Croatian Catholic Church and Vatican in fact viewed policies against Serbs as advantegous to Roman Catholicism Nevertheless historian Tomasevich praised some of the public statements and deeds made by archbishop Aloysius Stepinac but noted that there were shortcomings in statements and actions regarding genocidal actions against the Serbs and the Serbian Orthodox Church In his diary Stepinac said that Serbs and Croats are of two different worlds north and south pole which will never unite as long as one of them is alive along with other similar views Croatias rehabilitation of Stepinac in 2016 met negative reaction in Serbia and Republika Srpska

  An estimated 120000 Serbs were deported from NDH to Germanoccupied Serbia and 300000 fled by 1943 The general plan was to have prominent people deported first so their property could be nationalized and the remaining Serbs could then be more easily manipulated By the end of September 1941 about half of the Serbian Orthodox clergy 335 priests had been expelled

  During the war and during Titos Yugoslavia various numbers were given for overall war casualties Estimations by Holocaust memorial centers also vary As concluded by historian Rory Yeomans the most conservative estimates put the lower number of 300000 and possibly as many as 500000 Serbs killed by Ustashe death squads executed or perished at concentration camps Tomasevich said that the exact number of victims in Yugoslavia is impossible to determine Sabrina P Ramet estimated at least 300000 Serbs massacred by the Ustae Demographer Bogoljub Koovi author of the most serious study of World War II victims in Yugoslavia estimated 370410000 Serbs who died in NDH The number of victims at the Jasenovac concentration camp remains a matter of debate but current estimates put the number at around 100000 about half of which were Serbs

  In Serbia and in the eyes of Serbs the Ustashe atrocities constituted a genocide Some Western and Jewish authors acknowledge it as a genocide or if not calling it explicitly genocide call Ustashe policies and acts genocidal R Lemkin also called Hungarian and Bulgarian policies against Serbs genocidal

  Catholic extremism was at the heart of Ustae policy and this meant that many Serbs in the NDH were given the option of either converting to Catholicism or face deportation to a concentration camp Serbs who refused to renounce the Orthodox Christian faith ultimately faced death in concentration camps across the NDH especially at Jasenovac concentration camp In the postwar era the Serbian Orthodox Church considered that the Serbian victims of this genocide were martys As a result the Serbian Orthodox Church celebrates Holy New Martys of Jasenovac Concentration Camp on September 13

  After World War II most of the remaining Ustashe went underground or fled to countries such as Australia Canada the United States and Germany with the assistance of Roman Catholic clerics and grassroots supporters

  The Yugoslav communist government did not use the Jasenovac camp as was done with other European concentration camps most likely due to SerbCroat relations Titos government attempted to let the wounds heal and forge brotherhood and unity in the peoples Tito himself was invited to and passed Jasenovac several times but never visited the site

  With the Partisan liberation of Yugoslavia many Ustashe leaders fled and took refuge at the college of San Girolamo degli Illirici near the Vatican Catholic priest and Ustashe Krunoslav Draganovi directed the fugitives from San Girolamo The US State Department and CounterIntelligence Corps helped war criminals to escape and assisted Draganovi who later worked for the American intelligence in sending Ustashe abroad Many of those responsible for mass killings in NDH took refuge in South America Portugal Spain and the United States Luburi was assassinated in Spain in 1969 by an UDBA agent Artukovi lived in Ireland and California until extradited in 1986 and died of natural causes in prison Dinko aki and his wife Nada lived in Argentina until extradited in 1998 Dinko dying in prison and his wife released Draganovi also arranged Gestapo functionary Klaus Barbies flight

  In the Croat diaspora the Ustashe became heroes Ustashe migr terrorist groups in the diaspora such as Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood and Croatian National Resistance carried out assassinations and bombings and also plane hijackings throughout the Yugoslav period


  Some Croats including politicians have attempted to minimise the magnitude of the genocide perpetrated against Serbs in the World War II puppet state of Germany the Independent State of Croatia

  By 1989 the future President of Croatia Franjo Tuman who had been a Partisan during World War II had embraced Croatian nationalism and published  in which he questioned the official number of victims killed by the Ustae during the Second World War In his book Tuman claimed that fewer than thirtythousand people died at Jasenovac Tuman also estimated that a total of 900000 Jews had perished in the Holocaust Tumans views and his governments toleration of Ustaa symbols frequently strained relations with Israel Nonetheless in his book he did confirm that genocide happened

  An example of ultranationalist antiSerb sentiment in contemporary Croatian public life is Thompson a Croatian rock band that has been protested against on numerous occasions for having sung Ustae songs most notably Jasenovac i Gradika Stara People publicly displaying Ustae affiliation at Thompson concerts in Croatia and elsewhere is a frequent occurrence leading to complaints from the Simon Wiesenthal Center

  In 2006 a video was leaked showing Croatian President Stipe Mesi giving a speech in Australia in the early 1990s in which he said that the Croats had won a great victory on April 10th the date of the formation of the Independent State of Croatia in 1941 and that Croatia needed to apologize to no one for Jasenovac Later on Mesi apologized for his indecent statement and stated that he undoubtedly considered antifascism to be the basis of modernday Croatia appreciated Yugoslav Partisans and considered it necessary to reaffirm antifascism as a human and civilization commitment in the function of the unavoidable condition for the building of a democratic Croatia a country of equal citizens

  On 17 April 2011 in a commemoration ceremony Croatian President Ivo Josipovi warned that there were attempts to drastically reduce or decrease the number of Jasenovac victims adding faced with the devastating truth here that certain members of the Croatian people were capable of committing the cruelest of crimes I want to say that all of us are responsible for the things that we do At the same ceremony then Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said there is no excuse for the crimes and therefore the Croatian government decisively rejects and condemns every attempt at historical revisionism and rehabilitation of the fascist ideology every form of totalitarianism extremism and radicalism Pavelis regime was a regime of evil hatred and intolerance in which people were abused and killed because of their race religion nationality their political beliefs and because they were the others and were different

  In 2008 in Melbourne Australia a Croat restaurant held a celebration to honour Ustae leader Ante Paveli The event was an outrageous affront both to his victims and to any persons of morality and conscience who oppose racism and genocide Dr Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center stated According to local press reports a large photograph of Paveli was hung in the restaurant Tshirts with his picture and that of two other commanders in the 194145 Ustae government were offered for sale at the bar and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia was celebrated Zuroff noted this was not the first time that Croatian migrs in Australia had openly defended Croat Nazi war criminals
  It is high time that the authorities in Australia find a way to take the necessary measures to stop such celebrations which clearly constitute racist ethnic and antiSemitic incitement against Serbs Jews and Gypsies

  The Ustae had sent large amounts of gold that it had plundered from Serbian and Jewish property owners during World War II into Swiss bank accounts Of a total of 350 million Swiss Francs about 150 million was seized by British troops however the remaining 200 million ca 47 million dollars reached the Vatican In October 1946 the American intelligence agency SSU alleged that these funds are still held in the Vatican Bank This matter is the crux of a recent class action suit against the Vatican Bank and other defendants

  World War II and especially its ethnic conflicts have been deemed instrumental in the later Yugoslav Wars 199195

  Israeli President Moshe Katsav visited Jasenovac in 2003 His successor Shimon Peres paid homage to the camps victims when he visited Jasenovac on 25 July 2010 and laid a wreath at the memorial Peres dubbed the Ustaes crimes to be a demonstration of sheer sadism

  The Jasenovac Memorial Museum reopened in November 2006 with a new exhibition designed by a Croatian architect Helena Paver Njiri and an Educational Center designed by the firm Produkcija The Memorial Museum features an interior of rubberclad steel modules video and projection screens and glass cases displaying artifacts from the camp Above the exhibition space which is quite dark is a field of glass panels inscribed with the names of the victims

  The New York City Parks Department the Holocaust Park Committee and the Jasenovac Research Institute with the help of thenCongressman Anthony Weiner DNY established a public monument to the victims of Jasenovac in April 2005 the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the camps The dedication ceremony was attended by ten Yugoslavian Holocaust survivors as well as diplomats from Serbia Bosnia and Israel It remains the only public monument to Jasenovac victims outside the Balkans

  To commemorate the victims of the Kragujevac massacre the whole of umarice where the killings took place was turned into a memorial park There are several monuments there the monument to the murdered schoolchildren and their teachers the Broken Wing monument the monument of pain and defiance and the monument One Hundred for One the monument of resistance and freedom Serbian poet Desanka Maksimovi wrote a poem about the massacre titled Krvava Bajka A Bloody Fairy Tale

  Paolo Giordano I Orsini
  Paolo Giordano Orsini 1541  13 November 1585 was an Italian nobleman and the first duke of Bracciano from 1560 He was a member of the Roman family of the Orsini

  The son of Girolamo Orsini and Francesca Sforza he was grandson on his fathers side of Felice della Rovere illegitimate daughter of Pope Julius II and Gian Giordano Orsini and on his mothers side of Count Bosio Sforza and Costanza Farnese an illegitimate daughter of Pope Paul III

  On 3 September 1558 he married Isabella de Medici daughter of Cosimo I de Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany at Poggio a Caiano Paolo Giordano lived mostly in Rome and his castle at Bracciano rather than with his wife who stayed mostly at Florence In 1571 he took part to the battle of Lepanto A year later in October 1572 he served as a general of the Spanish infantry in a campaign that tried to reclaim the garrison of Navarino in the Peloponnese

  On 16 July 1576 his wife died unexpectedly at the Medici villa of Cerreto Guidi during a hunting holiday According to her brother the grand duke Francesco I de Medici this occurred while she was washing her hair in the morning  She was found by Signor Paolo Giordano on her knees having immediately fallen dead This official version of events was not generally believed and the Ferrarese ambassador Ercole Cortile obtained information that Isabella was strangled at midday by her husband in the presence of several named servants

  Isabella was the second sudden death in an isolated country villa in the Medici family her cousin Leonora having died of a similar accident only a few days before Most historians assume that Paolo Giordano killed his wife in reprisal for carrying on a love affair with his cousin Troilo Orsini or that he acted on instructions of Isabellas brother the grandduke One scholar Elisabetta Mori has argued that Isabella de Medici died of natural causes and that the rumour that Paolo Giordano murdered her was spread by enemies of the Medici

  After these events Paolo Giordano returned to Rome where he started a relationship with Vittoria Accoramboni wife of Francesco Peretti the nephew of the future Pope Sixtus V Peretti was assassinated it was believed by Paolo Giordanos order in April 1581 Wanted by both the Papal and Florentine police Paolo Giordano took refuge in northern Italy first in Venice and then in Abano and Sal with his mistress whom he married on 20 April 1585 He died at Sal on 13 November 1585

  On 22 December Vittoria was herself assassinated by Ludovico Orsini of the Monterotondo line on the instigation of Grand Duke Francesco The Medici Francesco and Cardinal Ferdinando wished to secure movable assets in possession of Vittoria for their nephew Virginio Orsini Paolo Giordanos son from his first marriage and principal heir

  Serasker
  Serasker or seraskier   is a title formerly used in the Ottoman Empire for a vizier who commanded an army

  Following the suppression of the Janissaries in 1826 Sultan Mahmud II transferred the functions of the old Agha of the Janissaries to the serasker The latter now became a distinct office at the head of the Ottoman military combining the functions of a commanderinchief and a minister of war He also took over the Janissary Aghas former duties regarding the upkeep of order in Istanbul Indeed as the police system developed and expanded with the empires progressive centralization it became one of the main duties of the serasker until 1845 when it became a separate agency

  The seat of the serasker and his department babi seraskeri or serasker kapsGate of the serasker initially was in the Eski Saray but were transferred to dedicated buildings in 1865 In 1879 the office was renamed to Ministry of War Harbiye Nezareti until 1890 when it reverted to its old name it was finally renamed again to Ministry of War in 1908

  Professor Hans Georg Nder became head of the company in 1990 In 1992 after the Fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent German reunification the Nder family repurchased the land in Knigsee that had been expropriated in 1948 and established a new wheelchair manufacturing facility and logistics centre there A medical science centre  was built by the company in Berlin in 2009 to celebrate 90 years since its foundation Max Nder died that year at the age of 94 By 2015 with a work force of 6300 and annual sales of 771 million the company was valued at 25 billion In February 2017 Ottobock acquired BeBionic

  To Kill the ChildLeaving Beirut
  To Kill the ChildLeaving Beirut is a 2004 digital download and a Japanonly CD single written and performed by Roger Waters

  The first song of the single runs at 3 minutes and 31 seconds The lyrics open with the image of a child sleeping in the glow of a Donald Duck light a reference to Waters prior song The Tide Is Turning Waters goes on to ask why a culture whose primary concerns are luxury consumption and petty values would kill the child The song ends with a plea to protect children from the crusadewaging bigots and bully boys  Slugging it out in the yard

  The second track of the single runs at 12 minutes and 29 seconds Most of the songs lyrics are derived from a short story about Waters hitchhiking excursion in Lebanon when he was a teenager These passages intoned in monologue over a descending synthesizer ostinato are interspersed with more recently penned refrains outlining Waters reaction to United States and United Kingdom involvement in the Iraq War Waters performed the song at every show on his The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour replacing the spokenword recitation with a visual backdrop of the story as a graphic novel

  Waters condemnation of George W Bush at one point the songs lyrics claim that Texas education must have fucked him up received negative reactions from audience members during his show at New Jerseys PNC Bank Arts Center on 6 September 2006 at Madison Square Garden in New York City on 12 September 2006 and in Tampa Florida on 19 May 2007 however audience reactions during the 5 October 2006 performance at the Hollywood Bowl were overwhelmingly positive with many patrons rising to their feet and cheering The song also received a positive reaction during its American performances at the Boston Massachusetts and Camden New Jersey Tweeter Centers in New York on 30 May 2007 as well as in other cities worldwide particularly Mumbai and Dubai Ironically during his first show in Dallas Texas on 2 May 2008 the line referring to George Bush and the Texas education was met with uproarious applause His last show on the American leg of the tour in Houston on the 4th was met with a fairly mixed reaction

  While many fans have embraced the songs lyrical content which is sympathetic towards the people of Lebanon some have objected to Waters political stance In 2006 Waters performed a concert in Neve Shalom Israel in front of a crowd of 50000 During the concert which included Leaving Beirut in the setlist Waters expressed his belief that Israel had to tear down the walls of the Israeli West Bank barrier pictured in the singles cover art to make peace with its neighbours The morning after Waters concert in Neve Shalom editorial writer Ben Dror Yemini wrote in the Israel newspaper Maariv

  The song has also received some criticism for its musical content and style one review of the 10 October show at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View California claimed that the song floundered musically despite being lyrically one of Waters best postFloyd works

  He was born at Dimples Hall Garstang Lancashire the son of Robert Plessington a Royalist Roman Catholic and Alice Rawstone a family thus persecuted for both their religious and political beliefs He was educated by the Jesuits at Scarisbrick Hall then at the Royal College of Saint Alban at Valladolid Spain and then at Saint Omer Seminary in France He was ordained in Segovia Spain on 25 March 1662 He returned to England in 1663 ministering to covert Catholics in the areas of Holywell and Cheshire often hiding under the name John Scarisbrick He was also tutor at Puddington Old Hall near Chester Upon arrest in Chester during the Popish Plot scare caused by Titus Oates he was imprisoned for two months and then hanged drawn and quartered for the crime of being a Catholic priest From the scaffold at Gallows Hill in Boughton Cheshire he spoke the following
  Plessington was beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI and canonized and made one of the Forty Martyrs on 25 October 1970 by Pope Paul VI
  There is now a school called St John Plessington in England which won TES School of the Year 2010 out of England Wales Ireland and Scotland

  There is a memorial tablet to him located in the entrance porch of St Werburghs Catholic Church Grosvenor Park Road Chester just a short distance from the spot he was executed on In 1980 his name was added to the base of the granite obelisk nearby that was erected in 1898 for the Protestant martyr George Marsh in Boughton which has the following inscription

  In the early 21st century a set of human bones found in an old trunk in Wales came to be regarded as possibly being Plessingtons remains They had been found in the late 19th century wrapped in 17thcentury clothing in a pub in Holywell Flintshire which had been known to be a secret gathering place for the Catholics of the region to worship covertly This had been the region where he had carried out his ministry before his arrest Showing signs of violence the bones had been considered those of some anonymous martyrs of the period and entrusted to a community of the Society of Jesus in nearby Tremeirchion

  When a grave believed to have been Plessingtons was opened in 1962 as part of the process for his beatification it was found to contain the remains of a younger man Interest later focused on this set of remains In 2015 Mark Davies Roman Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury started a campaign to raise the funds for the testing of the DNA of the bones

  Zoya Akhtar said in an interview that she wrote the first draft seven years ago while relaxing on Palolem beach in Goa In an interview she said
  I hand wrote it and it was some ridiculous epiclength when I came back and transcribed it on my laptop The first film is the easiest to write because its usually what the person knows their personal graphs milieu and feelings Luck By Chance is not about established actors but those who are waiting for things to happen Farhans character is fresh off the boat while Konkanas does bit roles looking for a big break

  The production team went through a host of names like Madhuri Dixit Saif Ali Khan Karisma Kapoor Kajol Devgn and Tabu Having seen a lot of struggling actors come to Mumbai to make a living out of Bollywood Zoya found it was easy to write the script for the film without any research She was inspired to write this movie by a lot of Bollywoodinspired movies like Guddi Rangeela and Om Shanti Om

  Javed Akhtar wrote the dialogues for the film incorporating as Zoya puts it his bizarre sense of humour Farhan had to reportedly train to get six pack abs for the film He was trained by Cheetah Yagnesh who appeared on the film as Farhans characters trainer

  Filming faced a lot of problems including the unpredictable Mumbai rains which halted a song shoot with Hrithik Roshan The rains washed out the entire set and eventually the entire tent began to leak Zoya was afraid that this would lead to shortcircuit and so all the lights had to be switched off

  According to Farhan principal photography for the film was completed in October

  Zoya Akhtar cast her brother Farhan to play the lead role after it was suggested to her by director Reema Kagti She became convinced after seeing Farhans performance in The Fakir of Venice She said in an interview Farhan was the perfect choice for the role in Luck By Chance because he knows the industry in and out He is smart and bright and both of us have been working together for years Problems arose with the huge casting of the film Zoya said I had to really think it out when I was deciding on these multiple actors that I wanted in the film It was tough to decide especially because I wanted the right actors who could play themselves and still look believable as part of the film Then there are other good actors like Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla who are playing characters in the film Next to be cast were her parents Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi along with such veteran stars as Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia Zoya said We could have had Shabana Azmi as the diva but I needed a mainstream heroine Only a leading lady would do Dimple has played it edgy Shes all warm soft sunshine and then theres a flip and shes hard cold steely Isha Sharvani teams up again with Hrithik Roshan after appearing together in an ad Juhi Chawla joined the cast playing Minty the wife of producer Rommy Rolly

  The producers decided to go with subtle promotion letting audiences explore the film by themselves The main trailer for the movie was released in the last week of December It introduced the main characters and set the pace for what the plot was about BigFlix a part of Reliance BIG Entertainment Ltd was given the task of promoting the movie The first bit of promotion came from the music wherein winners were given signed albums by Farhan Akhtar and Konkona Sen Sharma They promoted the whole movie across the nation in all 112 stores in 10 cities as well to the international audiences through its videoondemand VOD site The prerelease promotional activities included online marketing and publicity of the films music videos trailers downloads previews preview shows contests and continued with other promotional activities postrelease like meetandgreet events with the star cast at select cities

  A unique promotional campaign was launched by producers Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani called Auto By Chance They introduced 10 Auto by Chance threewheelers in suburban Mumbai suburbs that would transport people for free to the destination of their choice in the suburbs The promotion was run in conjunction with Big FM radio station and Godrej One passenger would be interviewed live by an RJ and go on air with his experience of getting lucky and enjoying the free ride The Indian gaming portal Zapakcom created a microsite for the movie with a game Luck by Chance  Lucky Break

  The movie was initially scheduled to be released 23 January 2009 alongside Raaz  The Mystery Continues but was pushed to 30 January Luck by Chance was released on 900 screens worldwide in 27 countries Of this over 700 screens were in India and the rest were in overseas markets such as the United States Canada UK UAE Australia South Africa and New Zealand

  The film was well received by critics Anupama Chopra of NDTV wrote Zoya pokes fun at Bollywood but she does it with a great affection There are some lovely little moments like the star daughter in a super short skintight outfit struggling to touch her producers feet without splitting a seam But what makes Luck By Chance compelling is the layers beneath the laughs Though the first half wobbles precariously as the script struggles to find a momentum but thankfully the narrative flows better in the latter half and culminates in a satisfying bittersweet end In the review at UAE Daily the United Arab Emirates reviewer said One of the prime reasons why Luck By Chance works is because of the writingRight from the characters to the individualistic scenes to the way Zoya puts them in a sequence Luck By Chance is easily one of the most cohesive scripts this side of the Atlantic If Zoyas writing is superb her execution of the written material deserves distinction marks The Times of India said Luck By Chance highlights how the film industry give regards to everything else but the story when making a movie and ironically weaves a fascinating story using that paradox Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOLin cited some drawbacks and said Luck By Chance provides you some smiles throughout the movie However it fails to leave you with the content smile that a feelgood movie ideally aims to do

  The movie achieved 71 percent positive rating by seven critics on the aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said It might seem as if Bollywood couldnt possibly satirize itself  the genre is already so overthetop  but Zoya Akhtar manages the trick deftly in Luck by ChanceA fabulous circustheme musical number pulls out all the stops but a scene in which an acting teacher explains why Hindi stars have to be more talented than those in Hollywood is a subtle comic gemIt is Mr Akhtar whose understated performance holds together this farranging cameofilled film He manages to remain sympathetic even while wreaking romantic havoc Frank Lovece of Film Journal International characterized it as The Player meets All About Eve in this seriocomic satire of the Bollywood film industry by a firsttime director whose collaring of over a dozen major Hindi stars for cameos speaks well of its biting accuracy while Kyle Smith of the New York Post found it gently humorous and almost totally lacking in the cynicism selfhatred and ennui that characterizes insideHollywood flicks

  The movie had a slow start at the box office and registered 25 to 30 attendance According to trade analyst and critic Joginder Tuteja the occupancy at the theatres came down to 50 Outside India the movie failed to perform per expectations

  In the US Luck by Chance debuted at number 32 In its opening weekend it collected 217439 approximately Rs 106 crores on 61 screens a perscreen average of 3556 In the UK Luck By Chance debuted at number 21 and collected 73822 approximately Rs 5095 lacs on 50 screens with a perscreen average of 1476 The movie did poorly in Australia and was a flop in India grossing 3914500 at the box office Worldwide the film grossed 4504365

  Isabella de Medici
  Isabella Romola de Medici 31 August 1542  16 July 1576 was the daughter of Cosimo I de Medici first Grand Duke of Tuscany and Eleonora di Toledo She was raised and educated in a humanist manner with her siblings including Francesco de Medici who succeeded their father as the Grand Duke of Tuscany To secure a relationship with the powerful Roman Orsinis Isabellas father arranged her marriage to Paolo Giordano I Orsini when she was 16 She remained in her fathers household after her marriage giving her an unusual degree of independence for a woman of her period Following the death of her father Isabella was probably murdered with the complicity of her husband and brother and in retribution for her relationship with Paolo Giordanos cousin Troilo Orsini

  Isabella was born in Florence where with her brothers and sisters she lived first in the Palazzo Vecchio and later in the Palazzo Pitti spending much of her time as a child at fathers ancestral country home Villa di Castello The Medici children were educated at home by tutors in a range of subjects such as classics languages and arts From an early age Isabella showed a great love for music which in her adulthood she used as means for selfexpression according to biographer Caroline Murphy A great beauty she had a lively highspirited and impulsive character that was commented on by courtiers

  In 1553 at age 11 Isabella was betrothed to 12yearold Paolo Giordano Orsini in line for the Duchy of Bracciano in southern Tuscany a liaison Isabellas father felt necessary to secure his southern border and his relationship the ancient Roman Orsini family The two married in 1558 in a semiprivate ceremony at Villa di Castello Paolo left the following day Concerned by the spending habits of his new soninlaw Cosimo decided to keep his daughter and her 50000 scudi dowry in Florence giving her greater freedom and control over her own affairs than was customary for Florentine women of the time

  Following her mothers death she acted as first lady of Florence for a time displaying the de Medici aptitude for politics She suffered several miscarriages and remained childless until her late twenties Her daughter Francesca Eleonora known as Nora was born in 1571 and eventually married her cousin Alessandro Sforza Her son Virginio was born in 1572 and eventually inherited his fathers dukedom

  Isabellas freespirited personality created rumours with regard to the nature of her relationship with Troilo Orsini Paolo Giordanos cousin who was charged with looking after her while her husband tended to military duties

  On 16 July 1576 Isabella died unexpectedly at the Medici villa in Cerreto Guidi during a hunting holiday According to her brother the grandduke this occurred while she was washing her hair in the morning  She was found by Signor Paolo Giordano on her knees having immediately fallen dead However the official version of events was not generally believed and the Ferrarese ambassador Ercole Cortile obtained information that Isabella was strangled at midday by her husband in the presence of several named servants Isabella was the second sudden death in an isolated country villa in the Medici family her cousin Leonora having died of a similar accident only a few days before Most historians assume that Paolo Giordano killed Isabella in reprisal for carrying on a love affair with Troilo Orsini or that he acted on instructions of the Grandduke Francesco Isabellas brother One scholar Elisabetta Mori has argued that Isabella de Medici died of natural causes and that the rumour that Paolo Giordano murdered her was spread by enemies of the Medici

  The Ned Brown Forest Preserve popularly known as Busse Woods adjoining Elk Grove Village and Schaumburg in Illinois is a unit of the Cook County Forest Preserve system It is named after Edward Ned Eagle Brown A section of the northeast quadrant of the forest preserve is the Busse Forest Nature Preserve which was registered as a National Natural Landmark in February 1980 Busse Forest Preserve Busse Woods was named for Cook County Commissioner William Busse in 1949

  Busse Woods the heart of the forest preserve is a mature Great Lakes hardwood forest A segment of the woods the Busse Forest Nature Preserve is listed as a national natural landmark as a surviving fragment of flatwoods a type of dampground forest formerly typical of extremely level patches of ground in the Great Lakes region Parcels of land with slow rates of precipitation runoff into adjacent wetlands and streams were likely to develop into flatwoods A flatwoods forest is characterized by red maple swamp white oak and black ash trees The black ash trees of Busse Woods are threatened by the emerald ash borer which was reported in Illinois for the first time in 2006

  Other parts of Busse Woods are betterdrained and include species more typical of the forests of northern Illinois such as the basswood hickory sugar maple and white oak the latter species being the state tree of Illinois

  There are of paved bicycle trail the Busse Woods Trail through the forest preserve a loop and two spurs providing pedestrian and bicycle access to the preserve In contrast to the natural area the northwest and southwest quadrants of the preserve are dominated by Busse Lake a artificial reservoir that serves as a floodcontrol catchment for Salt Creek and by the tall skyscrapers of eastern Schaumburg

  The Friends of Busse Woods a nongovernmental organization began operations in 2008 It cooperates with the Forest Preserve District of Cook County to oversee stewardship partnering operations at Busse Woods Partnership operations include invasive species management trash removal and native plant reseeding and restocking The operations are carried out by volunteer stewards

 <doc id="7701863" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7701863" title="Orion abort modes">
  Orion abort modes
  NASAs Orion multipurpose crew vehicle MPCV was planned as the first American spacecraft since Project Apollo to use an escape system in the event of a launch abort something its predecessor the Space Shuttle had for only its first four orbital test flights in 19811982 Like the Apollo command and service module CSM the Orion CEV would use the launch escape system LES a solidfueled tractor rocket that would be able to pull the Orion crew module away from a malfunctioning Space Launch System SLS rocket during the initial launch phase Based on the launch escape system found on the SovietRussian Soyuz spacecraft the LAS designed and manufactured by ATK for the Orion CEV would be larger than the Soyuz version and will have more thrust than the Atlas 109D booster that carried astronaut John Glenn into orbit in 1962

  The earlier Apollo system had various abort modes depending on altitude velocity and other circumstances Likewise the Orion will have similar modes of operation for its launch performance aborts Some of these may not use the LAS itself but would use the second stage of the Ares I or even the Orion vehicles own propulsion system the Aerojet AJ10 engine instead

  Initially designed to land on solid ground like that of the early and current Soviet and Russian manned spacecraft Vostok Voskhod and Soyuz with a water landing as a backup in August 2007 NASA tentatively redesigned the Orion for water landings splashdowns as the primary mode of landing with ground landings as the emergency backup  Under the advice of the Exploration Systems Architecture Study ESAS report NASA will most likely develop abort procedures that resemble the abort procedures used on Apollo but with some procedures carried over from the Shuttle

  The method of abort either using the LAS or the second stage of the Space Launch System booster depends on how far into the flight the spacecraft and crew are traveling

  NASA has acquired several MRAPs to station near the launch pad should there be time for the crew to evacuate the vehicle One will be occupied by emergency rescue personnel while the other will stand empty behind a blast shelter Pad emergency egress enables astronauts and engineers to quickly escape the perimeter of the rocket Both ziplines and roller coasters were at one time studied for this purpose

  During the first 120 seconds of flight up to the jettisoning of the solidfueled boosters at  the Orion crew module CM will separate from the rest of the rocket propelled by the LAS Unlike the Apollo Launch Escape System which used a pair of canards and the weight of the spacecraft to flip the vehicle over for landing the Orion LAS has a set of steering rockets that will steer the spacecraft away from the malfunctioning SLS as well as prepare the spacecraft for both separation and splashdown The tower will then be jettisoned 14 seconds later and the hypergolic fuel on the Orion CM would be automatically released at a predetermined altitude

  After the LAS is jettisoned the Orion crew and service modules CSM will separate as a whole from the SLS and either use its large AJ10 engine or smaller control engines to maneuver from the rocket Similar to a Space Shuttle transAtlantic TAL abort profile the Orion will use the AJ10 engine to propel the spacecraft to a desired separation point in which then the Orion CM would land in either western Spain or Morocco on due east ie lunar flights or in Ireland or the United Kingdom on ISSbound flights A splashdown in the eastern Atlantic Ocean would only be a contingency

  The SLS would propel the Orion CSM into an initial orbit upon which the spacecraft will immediately separate and then perform a retrofire that will allow the Orion CM to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the US West Coast or make a ground landing at either Edwards Air Force Base in California or White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico This is similar in profile to the Shuttles abort once around AOA profile

  If the SLS suffers lessthanideal performance during the initial orbit insertion it can be restarted 45 minutes later to place the Orion CSM into a less than ideal orbit that can be corrected with the onboard propellant reserves later in the flight This is similar to the Shuttles Abort To Orbit ATO profile but depending upon the stable orbit reached it may require NASA to end the mission with a landing at either Edwards or White Sands within a 24hour period

  The four abort modes would also be used if the Max Launch Abort System MLAS a proposed alternative to the LAS is flown in place of the LAS The MLAS which resembles the LAS but without the Soyuzlike rocket tower uses a strengthened boost protective cover but with the main rockets placed inside of the BPC itself

  Hairy Hands
  The Hairy Hands is a ghost storylegend that built up around a stretch of road in Dartmoor in the English county of Devon which was purported to have seen an unusually high number of motor vehicle accidents during the early 20th century

  The legend of the Hairy Hands is set in Postbridge Dartmoor The road is now known as the B3212

  According to the story surrounding them the Hairy Hands are a pair of disembodied hands that appear suddenly grab at the steering wheel of a moving car or the handlebars of a motorcycle and then force the victim off the road In some cases the hands are described as being invisible

  Since around 1910 drivers and cyclists have reported suffering unusual accidents along the road between Postbridge and Two Bridges In many cases the victims reported that their vehicle had jolted or swerved violently and steered off the side of the road as if something had taken hold of the wheels and wrenched it out of their control

  In most instances the victims ran into a verge and survived Their experiences remained a local curiosity until June 1921 when Dr EH Helby the medical officer for Dartmoor Prison was killed when he lost control of his motorcycle combination Two young girls children of the prison governor who had been riding in the sidecar survived Several weeks after Dr Helbys death there was another incident in which a coach driver lost control injuring several passengers who were thrown out of their seats Then on 26 August 1921 an army Captain reported that a pair of invisible hands had taken hold of him and forced his motorcycle off the road after which the story was picked up by newspapers in London and the story became known nationwide

  In Supernatural Dartmoor by Michael Williams there is a story told by journalist and author Rufus Endle He claimed that while driving near Postbridge on an unstated date a pair of hands gripped the driving wheel and I had to fight for control He managed to avoid a crash and the hands disappeared as inexplicably as they had come He requested that Williams not publish the story until after his death for fear of ridicule

  Not all reported incidents occurred in moving vehicles In one incident in 1924 a woman camping on the moor with her husband reported seeing a hairy hand attempting to gain access to her caravan during the night She reported that the hand retreated after she made the sign of the Cross

  After the story of the Hairy Hands appeared in the national press several investigations were carried out into the road It was eventually determined that the accidents were most likely due to the camber of the roads surface which reached dangerous levels in places and was duly altered

  According to local sceptics most of the accidents were caused by people who were unfamiliar with the area driving too fast down narrow country roads with high walled sides resulting in them either losing control or misjudging the road and running off its edges

  Most variations of the legend of the Hairy Hands do not specify the origins of the hands or attribute to them any specific purpose other than driving motorists off the road A few local versions of the story attribute the hands to an unnamed man who died in an accident on the road

  It Begins Again
  It Begins Again is the tenth studio album recorded by Dusty Springfield and the ninth released Recorded during the middle of 1977 It Begins Again was her first completed and released album since Cameo five years earlier Two of the albums titles Turn Me Around and A Love Like Yours Dont Come Knocking Every Day were tracks from the abandoned 1974 Longing sessions and Springfield decided to record new versions of both songs for It Begins Again placing Chi Coltranes Turn Me Around as the opening track

  It Begins Again which was Springfields debut album for the United Artists label in the US and Mercury Records in the UK was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Englishman Roy Thomas Baker at the time best known for helping create the four first albums by Queen Musically It Begins Again was however geared towards the American adult contemporary pop and disco markets Contributing on the album were some of the most renowned American session musicians of the era such as Jay Graydon Jeff Baxter Joe Sample Ed Greene and David Paich and it featured backing vocals by Pattie Brooks Dianne Brooks and Brenda Russell  all acclaimed recording artists and composers in their own right The songs on the album were also written by a number of notable composers and lyricists among others Nona Hendryx Lesley Gore Ellen Weston Dean Parks Peter Allen and Carole Bayer Sager Barry Manilows Sandra often singled out as the highlight of the set is a gentle piano ballad that portrays the life of a suburban housewife who minutely details her daily chores all the while assuring both herself and the listener that I swear I love my husband and I swear I love my kids  yet in the last verse she reveals that she one day found herself cutting her wrists doing the dishes quite by mistake It was real touch and go for a while

  Containing a diverse range of styles It Begins Again was seen as somewhat experimental by Springfield herself as well as music critics who generally gave it favourable reviews Despite the critical reception the hopeful album title as well as a series of promotional performances made in both the US and the UK promoting the uptempo singles A Love Like Yours and Thats the Kind of Love Ive Got for You It Begins Again only briefly made the charts in Britain peaking at No 41 and did not chart in the US Springfield stated that she had wanted to try something different but felt that she now needed to move into a different style a commercial lightweight RB which resulted in the following album Living Without Your Love

  In 2002 MercuryUniversal Music UK released the album on CD for the first time then also including Tom Moultons extended remix of Thats the Kind of Love Ive Got for You originally only released as a promotional 12 single which took advantage of the popularity of disco at the time The song which was the closing track on It Begins Again was however the only true disco song on the album The 12 version was somewhat popular with US deejays and the track in fact managed to reach No 31 in the US Hot Dance Club Play chart

  When the Pet Shop Boys in 2005 released their instalment in the mix album series  they both included a Dusty Springfield track Neil Tennant chose her 60s classic Goin Back  and Chris Lowe rather surprisingly the ballad Id Rather Leave While Im in Love from It Begins Again

  Rede Tupi  also known as TV Tupi or formally as Rdio Difusora So Paulo SA was the first television network in South America The network was owned by Dirios Associados who formed the Rede de Emissoras Associadas Rede Tupi was founded and launched on September 18 1950 by Assis Chateaubriand in So Paulo initially broadcasting on Tupi Television Channel 3 whose first broadcast was on September 20 of that same year Rede Tupi was later broadcast in 1960 on Tupi Television Channel 4 after the inauguration of TV Cultura Culture TV Channel 2 Rede Associada Associated Network and also a TV Station from Associadas Their competitors were Rede Record Channel 7 and Rede Excelsior Network Excelsior

  In Rio de Janeiro TV Tupi was broadcast on Tupi Channel 6 and had its own station and studios there In Braslia TV Tupi was retransmitted by TV Braslia on Channel 6 In Salvador TV Tupi was retransmitted by TV Itapoan on Channel 5 Other TV Stations were formed by the Rede de Emissoras Associadas Network of Associated Broadcasters all Tupi affiliates and directly operated stations

  Named for the Tupiniquim tribe in Brazil Rede Tupi was a pioneer in television programming in South America setting the tone for the best dramas news programming sports theater and entertainment in the 1950s and 1960s such as TV de Vanguarda Vanguard TV O Reprter Esso The Esso Reporter Alo Docura Clube dos Artistas 195280 Beto Rockfeller O Mundo e das Mulheres The World for Women and many more It led the way for the establishment of television stations throughout Brazil and in 1960 beat other stations in broadcasting via satellite the first Brazilian TV network to achieve such a feat in honor of the formal opening of Brasilia

  Its success prompted other nations in the continent to have television stations The network added new talent to Brazilian show business which was then a thriving industry depending on movies and radio During the 1960s its programs revolutionized television through animation humor comedy and childrens shows plus the telenovelas that gave rise to the 1965 launch of its rival network in Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo

  Tupi had its own mark in news Rede Tupi de Noticias Tupi News Network became one of its successful broadcasts The newscast was unique because it was broadcast three times each night Ana Maria Braga was the main presenter It had three sections sports local news and nationalworld news

  In 1964 it became Brazils second television network to broadcast in color following Rede Excelsior in 1962 After its founders death in 1968 the network due to a crisis with its owners transitioned itself becoming the first national television network in 1970 composed of its two main stations Channels 4 and 6 its 7 other stations and 17 affiliate stations nationwide

  Tupi in 1972 joined other Brazilian stations in the move to full color TV broadcasts On March 31 that very year Tupis special program Mais Cor em Sua Vida More Color in Your Life officially kicked off its color transmissions and debuted a new logo in celebration replacing the old number 6 logo used in Rio during its monochrome days

  After 29 years of continuous broadcast Rede Tupi became defunct on July 16 to 18 1980 when its two stations in So Paulo Tupi Channel 4 and Rio de Janeiro Tupi Channel 6 shut down together with its 7 other stations nationwide by order of the federal government of Brazil  a military dictatorship at the time The Department of National Telecommunications did not approve the planned extension of Rede Tupis television concession The Rio station signedoff for the last time on midday of the 18th following the other stations the previous day The final days of broadcasts at the networks Rio de Janeiro studios including the 18hour long vigil were covered by various networks in Brazil including Rede Bandeirantes

  Tupis So Paulo Porto Alegre and Belm channels became the nuclei of SBT Brazilian Television System then TVS TV Studios Channel 4 of the Grupo Silvio Santos Silvio Santos Group of Silvio Santos later in August 1981 Its Rio outlet became the nucleus of Rede Manchete Manchete Network Channel 9 of the Bloch Editores Bloch Editors publishing group of Adolpho Bloch in June 1983

  DKW F102
  The DKW F102 is a passenger car that was produced from August 1963 by the German manufacturer Auto Union Superseding the Auto Union 1000 it was the last model branded as a DKW by the manufacturer and also the last West German production car equipped with a twostroke engine

  The last European built Auto Union 1000 and 1000S models were produced in July 1963 and the DKW F102 was presented as a replacement model in September 1963 although volume production of 2door F102s began only in March 1964 with four door cars joining them on the production line in January 1965

  It was the last model developed before the Volkswagen takeover Under Volkswagen control the F102 provided the basis for the later Audi F103 models the Audi and later Audi 72 plus 60 75 80 and Super 90

  The F102 featured stateoftheart twostroke technology for its time and a unibody of modern design Nevertheless the market of the 1960s shunned twostroke engines as oldfashioned The F102 in consequence sold below the companys expectations and was the source of huge financial losses Due to this situation Volkswagen was forced to implement a radical change in 1965 The production of twostrokeengines was ended with the last F102s produced in March 1966 by when 52753 or 53053 had been produced The F102 was redesigned to accommodate a fourcylinderfourstrokeengine At this point the name of DKW was abandoned and the F102 mutated into the Audi F103 the first new Audi model since 1938

  Triruthenium dodecacarbonyl
  Triruthenium dodecacarbonyl is the chemical compound with the formula RuCO Classified as metal carbonyl cluster it is a dark orangecolored solid that is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents The compound serves as a precursor to other organoruthenium compounds

  The cluster has D symmetry consisting of an equilateral triangle of Ru atoms each of which bears two axial and two equatorial CO ligands OsCO has the same structure whereas FeCO is different with two bridging CO ligands resulting in C symmetry

  RuCO is prepared by treating solutions of ruthenium trichloride with carbon monoxide usually under high pressure The stoichiometry of the reaction is uncertain one possibility being the following

  The chemical properties of RuCO have been widely studied and the cluster has been converted to hundreds of derivatives High pressures of CO convert the cluster to the monomeric ruthenium pentacarbonyl which reverts to the parent cluster upon standing
  The instability of RuCO contrasts with the robustness of the corresponding FeCO The condensation of RuCO into RuCO proceeds via initial ratelimiting loss of CO to give the unstable coordinatively unsaturated species RuCO This tetracarbonyl binds RuCO initiating the condensation

  Upon warming under a pressure of hydrogen RuCO converts to the tetrahedral cluster HRuCO RuCO undergoes substitution reactions with Lewis bases
  where L is a tertiary phosphine or an isocyanide

  At high temperatures RuCO converts to a series of clusters that contain interstitial carbido ligands These include RuCCO and RuCCO Anionic carbido clusters are also known including RuCCO and the bioctahedral cluster RuCCO RuCO derived carbido compounds have been used to synthesize nanoparticles for catalysis These particles consist of 67 atoms and thus are all surface resulting in extraordinary activity

  Druginduced lupus erythematosus
  Druginduced lupus erythematosus DIL or DILE is an autoimmune disorder similar to systemic lupus erythematosus SLE caused by chronic use of certain drugs These drugs cause an autoimmune response the body attacks its own cells producing symptoms similar to those of SLE There are 38 known medications to cause DIL but there are three that report the highest number of cases hydralazine procainamide and quinidine While the criteria for diagnosing DIL has not been thoroughly established symptoms of DIL typically present as muscle pain and joint pain Generally the symptoms recede after discontinuing use of the drugs

  Signs and symptoms of druginduced lupus erythematosus include the following

  These signs and symptoms are not side effects of the drugs taken which occur during short term use DIL occurs over longterm and chronic use of the medications listed below While these symptoms are similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus they are generally not as severe unless they are ignored which leads to more harsh symptoms and in some reported cases death

  The processes that lead to druginduced lupus erythematosus are not entirely understood The exact processes that occur are not known even after 50 years since its discovery but many studies present theories on the mechanisms of DIL
  A predisposing factor to developing DIL is Nacetylation speed or the rate at which the body can metabolize the drug This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme Nacetyltransferase A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators In addition these patients had more hydralazine metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators These metabolites byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body of hydralazine are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide These oxidants have been found to react with hydralazine to produce a reactive species that is able to bond to protein Monocytes one type of white blood cell detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T helper cells creating antinuclear antibodies leading to an immune response Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and hydralazine are necessary to understand the processes involved in DIL
  Of the drugs that cause DIL hydralazine has been found to cause a higher incidence Hydralazine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure Approximately 5 of the patients who have taken hydralazine over long periods of time and in high doses have shown DILlike symptoms Many of the other drugs have a low to very low risk to develop DIL The following table shows the risk of development of DIL of some of these drugs on a high to very low scale




  Antinuclear antibodies are usually positive in drug induced Lupus AntiNeutrophil Cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA can also be positive in association with certain drugs Furthermore AntiHistone antibodies can also be positive in drug induced lupus

  AntiHistone antibodies are positive in up to 95 of patients with drug induced lupus The most common medications associated with drug induced lupus are hydralazine procainamide isoniazid methyldopa chlorpromazine quinidine and minocycline

  It is important to recognize early that these drugs are causing DIL like symptoms and discontinue use of the drug Symptoms of druginduced lupus erythematosus generally disappear days to weeks after medication use is discontinued Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs will quicken the healing process Corticosteroids may be used if more severe symptoms of DIL are present

  Lady Knox Geyser
  The Lady Knox Geyser is a geyser in the Waiotapu area of the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand It is named after Lady Constance Knox the second daughter of Uchter Knox 15th Governor of New Zealand The geyser is induced to erupt daily at 1015am by dropping a surfactant into the opening of the vent Eruptions produce a jet of water reaching up to 20m and can last for over an hour depending on the weather The visible spout is made of rocks placed around the base of the spring to enhance the eruption over the years silica from the eruptions has built up to give a white coneshaped appearance

  Because the geyser was discovered early in the 20th century it has no Mori name unlike almost every other thermal feature in New Zealand

  In 1901 the first open prison in New Zealand was established at Waiotapu its object to accommodate some of the betterbehaved prisoners from around the jails of the Rotorua Lakes District

  It was a gang of those prisoners who first discovered the clearing in which the geyser is situated and that the spring could be made to erupt by adding soap discovered when they first added soap to the hot water to wash their clothes

  Horse Latitudes poetry collection
  Horse Latitudes is tenth collection of poetry from the Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon It was published by Faber and Faber on 19 October 2006 It consists of 19 sonnets each named for a battle beginning with the letter B

  Its name stems from the areas north and south of the equator in which sailing ships tend to be becalmed and where sailors traditionally and possibly apocryphally threw horses overboard to lighten the ship and conserve food supplies see Horse latitudes The title was previously employed by Doors singer Jim Morrison for a song on the Strange Days album

  Like many of Muldoons recent collections Horse Latitudes contains a long poem  in this case a sonnet sequence ostensibly describing battle scenes through time and place The collection also features several other characteristic features of Muldoons work such as fixed poetic forms and deft technique combined with a seemingly casual approach full of puns slantrhymes and wordplay The collection is based on serious themes and emotions Muldoon has reportedly said that the battle of Baghdad is implied by omission consistent with the themes of evasion silence and censorship

  This collection contains the poem Sillyhow Stride written in memory of Warren Zevon

  In his review of Horse Latitudes James Fenton of The Guardian described the work as disconcerting and praised Muldoon for the brilliance of his verbal transformations

  Jim McCue of The Independent described Muldoon as a good poet in the doldrums saying that after 48 trips to the dictionary he felt the books erudition is for show and wordplay stands in for meaning instead of standing up for it

  The New York Times noted the clever and obscure references which Muldoon used to convey the anger and sadness in his poetry and said the poems weird levity only darkens the tone The review of Robert Potts in The Telegraph echoed this saying the ludic nature of Muldoons work has occasionally irritated less patient readers but that his fun does not preclude his seriousness Potts also praises Muldoon for his absolute control of pitch and tone his slinky rhythms and winking jests

  The Irish incarnation of The Independent said understanding Muldoon is often about as easy as to imagine Finnegans Wake outselling the Farmers Journal but added however much the subjectline veers in the end it comes home surprisingly enough to simplicity and clarity Reviewer Brian Lynch mentioned the intensely personal subject matter of his familys cancer history and the juxtaposition between this and the battles through history He concluded Muldoon more often than not manages by dint of skill to bring the private and public momentarily into balance to achieve the calm associated with the oceanic standstill found at the latitudes of the title

  The mall experienced a number of changes in the 1990s In 1993 the May Company store closed leaving the mall with only two anchors The Broadway and Sears which reduced overall traffic after merging with May Departurement Stores In 1996 a fourth anchor building was annexed in front of the malls main entrance along with a fourstory parking structure The store was RobinsonsMay Later that year Macys bought out The Broadway and converted its threestory building to a Macys location In 1999 Gottschalks moved into the old May Co building after it purchased The Harris Company and closed its store in the Carousel Mall also located in San Bernardino despite local efforts to keep Harris at their original location

  In 2000 the main entrances were renovated placing trees and benches at all entrances and a new mall sign along with a new remodeled Food Court next to Sears where the old Millers Outpost was located In 2006 Macys bought out RobinsonsMay and since having two anchors on the same property was redundant decided to close the old Broadway building in favor of the more modern built RobinsonsMay building at its current location

  The vacant Broadway building was sold to Mervyns in 2007 for renovation and a proposed opening in September 2008 but the Mervyns company was liquidated around that time after filing for Chapter 7 Also in October 2008 construction was made to seal off the vacant and smaller second level of the mall to public traffic In 2009 Forever 21 announced it would move into the vacant building that was partially renovated by Mervyns Gottschalks closed its doors in July 2009 after they too filed for Chapter 11 liquidation JCPenney announced that they will open at the Former Gottschalks building

  In 2013 Macerich Corporation installed over 4000 solar panels on the corridor rooftops to reduce their dependence on electricity during operating hours EV Charging Stations were also installed in the parking lots at the major entrances In 2015 Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties including the Sears at Inland Center into Seritage Growth Properties In 2016 JCPenney opened a store in the former Gottschalks building

  In 2006 the original Macys store which occupied a dated The Broadway location was closed and the more modern RobinsonsMay was converted to Macys as part of the Federated Department Stores merger with May Department Stores Mervyns was to take over the old anchor space but failed to open after their bankruptcy finalized in 2009

  Construction was also completed in 2007 to seal off the lower level demolishing a staircase and glass elevator that took customers to the lower level of the mall that remained vacant after Oshmans Sporting Goods and the old video arcade closed down in prior decades After construction was completed the upper level floor was made solid and a Childrens Play Area themed after US Route 66 was built near the old staircase location

  On January 2008 parking lots adjacent to the parking structure and a small portion of the underutilized western parking areas of the mall were used in the recent SANBAG and CalTrans I215 expansion project The Inland Center Drive overpass reopened next to the mall in April 2010

  During 2009 two adjacent pads to Inland Center owned by Macerich corporation were razed and placed for sale On North Mall Blvd and E Street Formerly a Citibank branch and South Mall Blvd and E Street Formerly Buffalo Ranch Restaurant

  A distinctive feature of Inland Center is the large cement vault in the center of the mall serving as its main entrance prior to 1988 The vault today serves as the walkway between Macys and Forever 21 with smallerformat stores along each side and a perpendicular main walkway with fullsize inline stores crossing the vault to reach Sears and JCPenney

  The mall currently hosts four anchors the most recent being J C Penney Upon opening in 1966 the mall contained Sears The Broadway and May Company The two anchors aside from Sears both ceased to exist by 1995 being replaced by Macys RobinsonsMay and Gottschalks respectively By 2009 the mall had remained at two anchors due to the closure of the southern wing Gottschalks until the opening of Forever 21 at the Broadway building Today the malls four anchors occupy the former tenants and remains as such

  Pharyngula blog
  Pharyngula a blog founded and written by PZ Myers is hosted on ScienceBlogs 20052011 in full and 2011present in part and on FreeThoughtBlogs 2011present In 2006 the science journal Nature listed it as the topranked blog written by a scientist based on popularity The blog addresses a range of topics including Myers academic specialty biology It has become particularly wellknown for Myers writing style characterized by sarcasm and for his criticism of intelligent design and creationism In 2009 Hemant Mehta ranked Pharyngula the most popular atheist blog based on subscriber levels and other factors

  According to Alexa Internet Pharyngulaorg was started on June 19 2002 It started out as an experiment in writing instruction for a class Students were required to submit miniessays to be published online After the project was finished Myers still had the webpublishing software and started to use it personally The blog is named after his favourite stage in embryonic development the pharyngula stage Pharyngula moved to hosting at ScienceBlogs in 2005

  In 2007 Myers reviewed Stuart Pivars book Lifecode which argues that selforganization at the embryonic and fetal stages determines the development and final structure of organisms Myers reviewed the book negatively stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from Pivars imagination and had no basis in actual evidence After some discussion in the comments threads of Pharyngula Pivar sued Myers for libel Within a week Pivar withdrew the lawsuit stating that the real issue got sidelined and that his problem was more with Seed Media Group

  In June 2008 Myers commented on national press reports that a University of Central Florida student took a host Eucharist wafer from a Catholic Mass in response to forcible attempts to stop him from carrying it back to his seat where he claimed he planned to show it to a fellow student who was curious about the Catholic faith After death threats were directed against the student by some who were offended by the students behavior Myers composed his first blog post on the topic
  After describing the harassment leveled against the student he asked readers to acquire for him consecrated Eucharistic hosts which he might show you sacrilege gladly and with much fanfare and could treat with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse all photographed and presented here on the web Bill Donohues Catholic League responded with a letter demanding the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Legislature take action against Myers Proponents of this action noted that Myerss blog could be reached from his university web page Myers has received several death threats and much hate mail over the controversy

  In August 2011 Myers and others founded a new blog network FreethoughtBlogs to host Pharyngula and other blogs in the atheistsecular field According to Myers the move was made as an acceptable compromise between him and National Geographic who at that time would be taking a more active role in hosting the ScienceBlogs stable and therefore bringing their standards  practices which are different from the more freewheeling policies of Seed Media and would cause a culture clash Myers stated that NatGeo and I have worked out an acceptable compromise This site on Freethoughtblogs is not in any way associated with National Geographic and that he would only crosspost to his original site on ScienceBlogs whatever I write that I feel is compatible with the more conservative ethos of National Geographic As such since August 2011 the complete Pharyngula has appeared on FreethoughtBlogs and a limited selection of those posts  the more sciencefocused ones  are crossposted to the ScienceBlogshosted version

  In September 2012 Myers announced that blogger and environmentalist Chris Clarke would become Pharyngulanowikinowikis coauthor Clarke left the blog in August 2013 partly because of the perceived unpleasantness of Pharyngula commenters

  Myers often criticizes intelligent design creationism and pseudoscientific movements and posts on subjects such as science religion politics superstition and education His experience in evolutionary developmental biology and as a teacher provides depth to the subjects of science and education One theme that arises regularly is that of cephalopods creatures that Myers finds quite fascinating

  In particular Myers frequently offers specific criticisms of creationism including intelligent design as well as the Discovery Institute Answers in Genesis and other groups that promote pseudoscientific ideas For example in February and March 2007 he focused many of his posts on creationist neurosurgeon Michael Egnor who had recently joined the Discovery Institute In addition to Myers criticisms of Egnors arguments on evolution and Intelligent Design Myers criticized the Discovery Institutes reliance on someone whose expertise wasnt relevant to evolution

  In early April 2007 Myers participated in an April Fools Day joke arranged by The Pandas Thumb which manufactured a website spoofing the Discovery Institutes page on which Egnor admitted that his association with the Discovery Institute was itself an April Fools joke This elaborate prank succeeded in fooling many of his readers while others succeeded in spotting jokes in the design of the false Discovery Institute page and concluded that this admission was itself the prank He made a point the following day that he perceived it as getting exceedingly difficult to believe some creationists were for real cf Poes Law and highlighted a quote by Stephen Meyer

  In June 2005 Myers criticized a cartoon by biblical literalist Jim Pinkoski which claimed that the Biblical line There were giants in the earth in those days Genesis 64 was literally intended to convey that early humans were much taller than their modern counterparts Pinkoski placed Adam at tall and Noah at tall What Myers found most interesting about this cartoon however was the note on it which read literally NOTE If you doubt this is possible how is it there are PYGMIES  DWARFS

  Myers argued that the existence of pygmies and dwarfs now is a non sequitur when it comes to whether humans were tall 6000 years ago If Pinkoskis claims were valid humans would perhaps continue to decrease in height and approach that small size at some time in the future but this does not mean those small humans would exist now barring the use of time travel a claim Pinkoski never makes Myers went on to mock the irrelevance of this argument with parodies such as


  The phrase has since been picked up by various bloggers to ridicule creationist arguments and is also popular with commenters at The Pandas Thumb The phrase is generally capitalized and bolded to match how it originally appeared in Pinkoskis cartoon

  Myers has voiced the position that many of the responses to Richard Dawkins The God Delusion are what he calls Courtiers Replies Replying to critics who felt that Dawkins ignored sophisticated versions of modern theology Myers compared them to courtiers fawning on the legendary emperor who had no clothes

  In other words critics complain about Dawkins not studying aspects of theology that are irrelevant to whether or not God exists in the same way as scholarly writings about imperial fashion are irrelevant when the emperor is naked Dawkins himself quoted the Courtiers Reply in a debate with Alister McGrath He also referenced the Courtiers Reply in the preface to The God Delusionnowikinowikis 2007 paperback edition

  Another recurring trope has been Myers reaction to the label fundamentalist atheist bestowed by some upon him Dawkins and others who espouse similar views Myers writes
  The new atheism I dont like that phrase either is about taking a core set of principles that have proven themselves powerful and useful in the scientific world  youve probably noticed that many of these uppity atheists are coming out of a scientific background  and insisting that they also apply to everything else people do These principles are a reliance on natural causes and demanding explanations in terms of the real world with a documentary chain of evidence that anyone can examine The virtues are critical thinking flexibility openness verification and evidence The sins are dogma faith tradition revelation superstition and the supernatural There is no holy writ and a central idea is that everything must be open to rational evidencebased criticism  its the opposite of fundamentalism

  Eventually Myers summarized his stance by invoking Blakes Law named for Pharyngula commentator Blake Stacey As formulated by Stacey in 2007 based in concept on Godwins Law
  In any discussion of atheism skepticism etc the probability that someone will compare a vocal atheist to religious fundamentalists increases to one

  Myers is strongly feminist and has written about discrimination against women

  Myers has made frequent use of the phrase deep rifts to satirize perceptions that atheism could experience a religious schism over disagreements on marketing atheism or the role of science and religion Myers does not deny there are some differences of opinion between prominent atheists but contends this is a good thing and is attributed to the freethinking nature of atheism

  Pacific Press Publishing Association
  The Pacific Press Publishing Association or Pacific Press for short is one of two major Seventhday Adventist publishing houses in North America It was founded in 1874 by James White in Oakland California and is now located in Nampa Idaho Its titles include theological works as well as books on topics such as vegetarianism and home schooling It owns its own printing operation It is owned by the North American Division of Seventhday Adventists

  The Seventhday Adventist Church was formally organized and named in 1863 It began to realize its great mission to go into all the world and preach the gospel Consequently Elders JN Loughborough and DT Bourdeau came to California in 1866 And by May 1871 there were 130 Adventists in California in the San Francisco and Santa Rosa area

  Late in 1872 James and Ellen White and their two sons Willie and James Edson came to California in the interest of the newly established work of the church on the Pacific Coast Plans were laid for the establishment of a health institute and a branch publishing house However no funds were available nor was a site yet secured

  One day while crossing the ferry from San Francisco to Oakland Mrs White through inspiration spoke to her husband Somewhere in Oakland she said is the place to locate the paper

  So in 1874 James White began to publish the Signs of the Times in Oakland It was printed under the aegis of Elder James White Editor and Proprietor The date of the first issue June 4 1874 The subscription price 200 a year to all those able to pay the subscription price and free to all others as far as the paper is sustained by donations of liberal friends of the cause These were the terms

  In the fall of 1874 at a camp meeting in Yountville the president of the California Conference Elder Loughborough presented the need of a publishing house to the people assembled That day 19414 was given in gold and in pledges There were less than 500 members in the congregation

  Soon construction of a plant on Castro Street in Oakland began This became known as the Pacific Seventhday Adventist Publishing Association Equipment installed included a fourroller airspring drum cylinder press powered by an upright donkey engine a paper cutter a book trimmer and some new type Soon the Signs of the Times circulation had passed 4000

  By 1887 the investment of Pacific Press had grown to 200000 and the annual business totaled 150000 From its beginning the Press prospered The press became well known on the West Coast for its quality work and prompt delivery of printing orders

  Around the start of the 20th century the subscription list of Signs of the Times was nearly 50000 Retail sales of the book department amounted to 94000 However commercial work continued to occupy an important place in production At times denominational work was set aside to accommodate the commercial It was felt that commercial work was necessary to keep the machinery going and profits coming in

  Mrs White encouraged management to move away from the city which was developing so rapidly around the plant The town of Mountain View wished to raise its status in the state The town leaders upon hearing that the Pacific Seventhday Adventist Publishing Association in Oakland which had gained a fair and growing reputation was looking for a more rural atmosphere in which to establish itself offered the Press five choice acres of land as well as a pair of lots for a church or meeting house

  The Press accepted the offer of the of land and in 1904 they moved to Mountain View Along with the plant came the families As a result real estate in Mountain View began to advance and area business grew

  A brick building soon took shape on the land donated by the town and work began to come in from customers who patronized the plant in Oakland Mrs White implored Management to rely on God alone and give up the commercial work that had followed them from Oakland and had received priority over church publications

  At 518 in the morning of April 18 1906 a great earthquake convulsed the whole bay area The walls of the plant crumbled Its offices were in shambles Yet within a few days the presses were running again

  On July 20 three months after the earthquake on a Friday about midnight a fire of undetermined origin broke through the roof in the northeast corner of the photoengraving room In two hours the entire building had become a blazing inferno Although the fire was finally subdued it was not entirely extinguished and it broke out a second time This time scarcely a charred board remained The paper stock of the plant finished books type plates manuscripts  all were destroyed

  Suddenly all the warnings of Mrs White came to mind Soon after the fire the Board of Directors stopped commercial work at the Pacific Press

  In 1955 ownership of Chapel Records was transferred from the Pacific Union Conference of SeventhDay Adventists to Pacific Press Publishing Association

  In 1982 the press lost an appeal in a case against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission wherein the court denied that the press could obtain a Title VII exemption to the employment code that would allow them to treat male and female employees differently

  By the early 1980s the costofliving index in the densely populated San Francisco Bay area made it almost impossible for young families to work at the plant This among other reasons made it expedient to move the plant from Mountain View In 1983 the Board of Trustees along with the General Conference Committee voted that the plant be sold and a move made to another area

  Nampa Idaho was chosen as the location for the new plant The new building contained of floor space Relocation to Idaho began in June 1984 and was completed in the late winter of 198485

  The move to Idaho was an advantageous one From the humble beginning in 1874 when the first Signs of the Times was issued with Elder James White editing the paper setting the type and printing the pages and with his son as a delivery boy the institution has grown to become the employer of over 250 workers at a plant larger than three football fields and generating an annual income of over 40 million Pacific Press is the largest bulk mailer in Idaho

  In 1994 Pacific Press began management of literature evangelist work with the establishment of the HHES Home Health Education Services Division Currently the HHES manages literature evangelist programs for Pacific Union North Pacific Union and Mid America Union

  The Retail Division for management of Adventist Book Centers was begun in 1996 The Division operated retail locations in the US and Canada and operated a bookmobile program in the mountain states region In August 2013 the Pacific Press board voted to return management of the stores operated by the Retail Division to the local Seventhday Adventist conferences Pacific Press closed the last of its Retail Division in the United States in the second half of 2014 Operations in Canada are expected to be closed by year end

  4 3 2 1 LL Cool J song
  4 3 2 1 is a song by LL Cool J featuring Method Man  Redman Canibus and DMX from LL Cool Js seventh album Phenomenon as the second single It was released on December 9 1997 for Def Jam Recordings and was produced by LL Cool J and Erick Sermon A remix was made with an additional verse from American southern hip hop artist Master P Both the original song minus Canibus and the remix with Canibus and Master P had accompanying music videos The song peaked at number 75 on the Billboard Hot 100 number 10 on the Hot Rap Singles and number 24 Hot RBHipHop Songs

  The song is notable for starting the LL Cool J vs Canibus feud LL took offense to the lines L is that a mic on your arm Let me borrow that which referenced his tattoo of a microphone on his arm  and which Canibus claimed was his own way of showing the rap veteran respect  and wrote an indirect diss to Canibus

  The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers  You hold the rusty sword I swing the Excalibur

  And also

  Now lets get back to this mic on my arm  If it ever left my side itd transform into a time bomb  You dont wanna borrow that you wanna idolize  And you dont wanna make me mad na you wanna socialize

  Before the song was released LL Cool J asked Canibus to change his lines Canibus claims that LL vowed to modify his own lines as well but the latter denied this and pointed out that nobody would know who he was talking about if only Canibuss line was changed The original version eventually leaked and fans started to piece the lines together Canibus would respond to the diss with Second Round KO LL would then respond to that diss with the Ripper Strikes Back On his 2000 GOAT album LL thanked Canibus for inspiration In addition despite appearing on the song Canibus was omitted from the original music video for the song due to the feud but was later included in the music video for the remix version

  This song features a vocal sample from LL Cool Js Rock the Bells off of the album Radio Another prominent sample featured in 4 3 2 1 is from the Beastie Boys song You Gotta Fight for Your Right To Party And Superrapin by Grandmaster Flash and The Furious 5

  Yoga Vasistha
  Yoga Vasistha  IAST  is a philosophical text attributed to Valmiki although the real author is unknown The complete text contains over 29000 verses The short version of the text is called Laghu Yogavasistha and contains 6000 verses The text is structured as a discourse of sage Vasistha to Prince Rama The text consists of six books The first book presents Ramas frustration with the nature of life human suffering and disdain for the world The second describes through the character of Rama the desire for liberation and the nature of those who seek such liberation The third and fourth books assert that liberation comes through a spiritual life one that requires selfeffort and present cosmology and metaphysical theories of existence embedded in stories These two books are known for emphasizing free will and human creative power The fifth book discusses meditation and its powers in liberating the individual while the last book describes the state of an enlightened and blissful Rama

  Yoga Vasistha teachings are structured as stories and fables with a philosophical foundation similar to those found in Advaita Vedanta is particularly associated with drstisrsti subschool of Advaita which holds that the whole world of things is the object of mind The text is notable for expounding the principles of Maya and Brahman as well as the principles of nonduality and its discussion of Yoga The short form of the text was translated into Persian by the 15thcentury

  Yoga Vasistha is famous as one of the historically popular and influential texts of Hinduism Other names of this text are MahaRamayana Arsha Ramayana Vasiha Ramayana YogavasisthaRamayana and Jnanavasistha

  The name Vasistha in the title of the text refers to Rishi Vasistha The term Yoga in the text refers to the underlying Yogic theme in its stories and dialogues and the term is used in a generic sense to include all forms of yoga in the pursuit of liberation in the style of Bhagavad Gita

  The long version of the text is called Brihat Yoga Vasistha wherein Brihat means great or large The short version of the text is called Laghu Yoga Vasishta wherein Laghu means short or small The longer version is also referred to simply as Yoga Vasistha and by numerous other names such as Vasiha Ramayana

  The date or century of the texts composition or compilation is unknown and variously estimated from the content and references it makes to other literature other schools of Indian philosophies Scholars agree that the surviving editions of the text were composed in the common era but disagree whether it was completed in the first millennium or second Estimates range states Chapple from as early as the sixth or seventh century to as late as the fourteenth century

  The surviving text mentions Vijnanavada and Madhyamika schools of Buddhism by name suggesting that the corresponding sections were composed after those schools were established or about 5thcentury The translation of a version of the text in 14th to 15thcentury into Persian has been the basis of the other limit among scholars such as Farquhar in 1922

  Atreya in 1935 suggested that the text must have preceded Gaudapada and Adi Shankara because it does not use their terminology but does mention many Buddhist terms Dasgupta a contemporary of Atreya states that the text includes verses of earlier text such as its III1650 is identical to one found in Kalidasas Kumarasambhava thus the text must be placed after the 5thcentury Dasgupta adds that the philosophy and ideas presented in Yoga Vasistha mirror those of found in Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara but neither mention the other which probably means that the authors of Yoga Vasistha were scholars who lived in the same century as Shankara placing the text in about 7th to early 8thcentury The shorter summary version of the text is attributed to the Kashmiri scholar Abhinanda who has been variously dated to have lived in 9th or 10thcentury

  Mainkar states that Yoga Vasistha probably evolved over time The first work states Mainkar was the original ancient work of Vasistha that was an Upanishad with Brahamanical ideas a work that is lost This text was suggests Mainkar was expanded into Moksopaya in or after 6thcentury which is now commonly known as LaghuYogavasistha The Laghu shorter version was then expanded into the full editions over time in the centuries that followed the completion of LaghuYogavasistha The syncretic incorporation of Buddhism and Hinduism ideas happened in the LaghuYogavasistha edition states Mainkar while ideas from Kashmiri Shaivism particularly the Trika school were added to the growing version by the 12thcentury Similar serial expansion revisions and interpolation is typical in Indian literature Peter Thomi has published additional evidence in support Mainkars theory on Yoga Vasisthas chronology

  The oldest surviving manuscript of the Moksopaya or Moksopaya Shastra has been dated to have been composed in Srinagar in the 10th century AD

  The text is traditionally attributed to Valmiki the author of Ramayana

  The author of the shorter version the LaghuYogavasistha is generally considered to be Abhinanda of Kashmir

  The text exists in many editions of manuscripts with varying number of verses but similar message The full editions contain over 29000 to a few with 32000 verses and in some editions about 36000 verses An abridged version by Abhinanda of Kashmir son of Jayanta Bhatta is Laghu Little Yogavasistha and contains 6000 verses

  The verses of Yoga Vasistha are structured in the genre of ancient Indian literature called Grantha In this genre each Shloka verse in the text is designed to equal 32 syllables while conveying its message A Grantha can be sung and depending on its meter set to specific Raga music This genre is found in Bhakti movement literature and Yoga Vasisthas Advaita theories and monism influenced the Grantha literature of Sikhism whose primary scripture is called Guru Granth Sahib

  The Yoga Vasistha is a syncretismsyncretic work containing elements of Vedanta Yoga Samkhya Saiva Siddhanta Jainism and Mahayana Buddhism thus making it according to Chapple a Hindu text par excellence including as does Hinduism a mosaicstyle amalgam of diverse and sometimes opposing traditions

  The text consists of six books

  The Nirnaya Sagar version of Yoga Vasistha manuscript has 1146 verses in the first Book 807 in second 6304 verses in third 2414 verses in the fourth book 4322 in the fifth while the last is longest with 14296 verses for a cumulative total of 29289 verses

  This is one of the longest Hindu texts in Sanskrit after the Mahabharata and an important text of Yoga It consists of Contents and stories of the Yoga Vasisthanumerous short stories and anecdotes used to help illustrate its ideas and message The text shows the influence of Advaita Vedanta and TrikaSaivite Trika school In terms of Hindu mythology the conversation in the Yoga Vasishta is placed chronologically before the Ramayana

  The traditional belief is that reading this book leads to spiritual liberation The conversation between Vasistha and Prince Rama is that between a great enlightened sage and a seeker of liberation The text discusses consciousness cosmology nature of the universe and consciousness the ultimate dissolution of body the libertyliberation of the tman Hinduismsoul and the nondual nature of existence

  The Yoga Vasistha states that there are four characteristics that mark someone ready for spiritual journey who


  Yoga Vasistha teachings are divided into six parts dispassion qualifications of the seeker creation existence dissolution and liberation It sums up the spiritual process in the seven Bhoomikas

  In Chapter 2 of Book VI titled as The story of Iksvaku the text explains the state of mokshanirvana liberation as follows Liberation is peace Liberation is extinction of all conditioning Liberation is freedom from every kind of physical psychological and psychic distress This world is not seen by the ignorant and the wise in the same light To one who has attained selfknowledge this world does not appear as samsara but as the one infinite and indivisible consciousness

  Martin v City of Struthers
  Martin v Struthers 319 US 141 1943 is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a law prohibiting the distribution of handbills from door to door violated the First Amendment rights of a Jehovahs Witness specifically their freedom of speech The ruling was 54 and deemed trespassing laws a better fit for the town imposing the ordinance

  In 1943 a woman from Struthers Ohio by the name of Thelma Martin went knocking on doors to pass out Jehovahs Witness leaflets to people in her city Martins visits were not well received by some households which led to her arrest

  She was convicted in the Mayors Court and fined for violating a Struthers Ohio city ordinance which made it illegal to knock on doors to distribute handouts to that contained information about religious meetings Martin confessed to handing out invitations to their religious meetings The city ordinance was created to keep solicitors from coming to peoples home and causing a disturbance

  The US Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the lower court The Court held that the First Amendment protects both the right to distribute literature and the right to receive it and stated that the distribution of literature is protected even if it creates the minor nuisance for a community of cleaning litter from its streets Justice Hugo Black writing the opinion of the court stated

  While door to door distributers of literature may be either a nuisance or a blind for criminal activities they may also be useful members of society engaged in the dissemination of ideas in accordance with the best tradition of free discussion

  The ordinance does not control anything but the distribution of literature and in that respect it substitutes the judgment of the community for the judgment of the individual householder It submits the distributor to criminal punishment for annoying the person on whom he calls even though the recipient of the literature distributed is in fact glad to receive it

  In any case the problem must be worked out by each community for itself with due respect for the constitutional rights of those desiring to distribute literature and those desiring to receive it as well as those who choose to exclude such distributors from the home

  We conclude that the ordinance is invalid because it is in conflict with the freedom of speech and press

  Therefore Martin won her right to distribute information

  Justices Reed Roberts and Jackson dissented Justice Reed wrote that
  The most  that can be or has been read into the ordinance is a prohibition of free distribution of printed matter by summoning inmates to their doors There are excellent reasons to support a determination of the city council that such distributors may not disturb householders while permitting salesmen and others to call them to the door Practical experience may well convince the council that irritations arise frequently from this method of advertising The classification is certainly not discriminatory

  To prohibit such a call leaves open distribution of the notice on the street or at the home without signal to announce its deposit Such assurance of privacy falls far short of an abridgment of freedom of the press

  LAssemble des sixcomts painting
  LAssemble des sixcomts French for The Assembly of the Six Counties also known as Manifestation des Canadiens contre le gouvernement anglais  SaintCharles en 1837 Demonstration of the Canadiens against the English government at SaintCharles in 1837 is a large oil painting executed on canvas by Ontario artist Charles Alexander Smith in 1890

  It depicts the Assembly of the Six Counties an event in 1837 part of the history of Quebec and the Patriote movement It is displayed in the permanent exhibition of the Muse national des beauxarts du Qubec in Quebec City

  The picture includes many elements of what is known about the Patriote movement and their time It features a number of Patriote leaders upon the stage at the right with accurate appearance Patriote leader LouisJoseph Papineau is shown in a speech to the crowd At the bottom right stand three flags From the left the first represents the influence the Patriotes received from the French Revolution the second is the Patriote flag and the third embodies the admiration of the Patriote for the American Revolution The Patriote flag remains a visual leitmotiv across the composition

  The right field profusely displays maple leaves a symbol of the French Canadians of the time they have now been discarded by their modernday Qubcois and Quebec nationalist successors because of their appropriation by the Canadian federation In the same section is the Coat of arms of Quebec leaning upon the wooden stage structure one anachronistic detail as this version contemporary to the paintings execution is the first arms of Quebec postConfederation granted in 1868

  The crowd mesmerized and invigorated at the same time by Papineaus much celebrated oratory skills holds many signs reading nationalist and independence slogans Many in attendance wear the tuques and ceintures flches belts characteristic of the Patriote symbology The Colonne de la libert stands tall in the background the one from Henri Juliens and the contemporary replica appear much shorter Finally a very young girl at the immediate leftofthemiddle evocatively stares at the spectator

  Smith was commissioned to paint it for display in the chamber of the Legislative Assembly in the Parliament of Quebec City However the government of Premier of Quebec CharlesEugne Boucher de Boucherville did not accept it and the work was passed unto various owners before finally becoming part of the Muse national des beauxarts du Qubec collection

  Located in Room 10 it is a part of the permanent exhibition of Quebec historyrelated art called Je me souviens Quand lart imagine lhistoire Je me souviens motto of Quebec When Art Imagines History The picture has seen restoration Nowadays a great number of books related to the Patriotes or their era in Quebec use the painting often cropped to illustrate their cover page

  In a similar fashion initial plans to erect a statue in honour of LouisJoseph Papineau on the Quebec City Parliament Hill were aborted because of the thencontroversial aspect of what was seen as a revolutionary figure A smaller statue was instead made for interior display in the Parliament and a monument such as the one originally envisioned was inaugurated in the 2000s

  The Assembly of the Six Counties gathered Patriote leaders and approximately 4000 followers in SaintCharles Lower Canada presentday Quebec on October 23 and October 24 1837 Presided by Wolfred Nelson it is the most famous of the various popular assemblies held during that year protesting the Russell Resolutions It was a prelude to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 that sought the independence of a Lower Canadian republic Speakers were united in their protest of the British colonial government but as one part supported economic boycotts of British products the other appealed to an armed uprising

  Max Gordon producer
  Max Gordon June 28 1892  November 2 1978 was an American theatre and film producer His credits included My Sister Eileen which he produced both on stage and on film

  Born Mechel Salpeter Gordon was the youngest son of immigrants from Poland His older brother Cliff used the stage name of Gordon and Max then used it also Cliff an entertainer in vaudeville died at age 32 in 1913

  Then in his early 20s Gordon within months formed a vaudeville agency with Albert Lewis his late brothers former vaudeville and burlesque partner They specialized in providing sketches for shows and their material and performers eg Phil Baker and Lou Holtz played the Keith and Orpheum circuits It was on May 24 1921 the tail end of this period months before the team produced their first play that Gordon wed Mildred Bartlett of Amsterdam New York Bartlett gave up her acting career she performed in films under the name Raye Dean a few months before the wedding at the request of her fiance

  Gordon soon became one of New Yorks most successful producers from the Roaring Twenties and Depressionera on into the Eisenhower years One of his first great hits came when he presented with Lewis the original stage incarnation of The Jazz Singer which ran from September 1925 to June 1926 The year following the stock market crash of 1929 Marx the jig is up is how he famously relayed the news to his friend and frequent tip recipient Gordon became an independent producer  By 1932 broke and suffering from a nervous collapse such friends as George Kaufman offered him fifteen
  hundred of the sixteen hundred dollars Kaufman had at that time and Harpo Marx came to see him in the hospital with his pockets stuffed with cash and strewed it over the bed
  It was in these years that Gordon gradually became playwright Kaufmans producer of choice  10 shows in 25 years starting in 1931 with the Astaires final musical The Bandwagon Gordon had even greater luck with the married playwrights Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin For Kanins Born Yesterday  it ran 1642 performances producer Gordon even had a hand in discovering its star Judy Holliday The minute she walked in I knew she was it

  His reputation during this era was immortalized in Cole Porters song Anything Goes from the musical of the same name

  Helicoverpa armigera
  The cotton bollworm corn earworm or Old World African bollworm Helicoverpa armigera also known as the scarce bordered straw in the UK where it is a migrant is a moth the larvae of which feed on a wide range of plants including many important cultivated crops It is a major pest in cotton and one of the most polyphagous and cosmopolitan pest species It should not be confused with the similarly named related species Helicoverpa zea

  This species comprises two subspecies Helicoverpa armigera armigera is widespread in central and southern Europe temperate Asia and Africa Helicoverpa armigera conferta is found in Australia and Oceania The former subspecies has also recently been confirmed to have successfully invaded Brazil and has since spread across much of South America and reached the Caribbean It is a migrant species able to reach Scandinavia and other northern territories

  The cotton bollworm is very variable in both size and colour The body length varies between with a wingspan of  The fore wings are yellowish to orange in females and greenishgray in males with a slightly darker transversal band in the distal third The external transversal and submarginal lines and the reniform spot are diffused The hind wings are a pale yellow with a narrow brown band at the external edge and a dark round spot in the middle

  The female cotton bollworm can lay several hundred eggs distributed on various parts of the plant Under favourable conditions the eggs can hatch into larvae within three days and the whole lifecycle can be completed in just over a month

  The eggs are spherical and 04 to 06mm in diameter and have a ribbed surface They are white later becoming greenish

  The larvae take 13 to 22 days to develop reaching up to 40mm long in the sixth instar Their colouring is variable but mostly greenish and yellow to redbrown The head is yellow with several spots Three dark stripes extend along the dorsal side and one yellow light stripe is situated under the spiracles on the lateral side The ventral parts of the larvae are pale They are rather aggressive occasionally carnivorous and may even cannibalise each other If disturbed they fall from the plant and curl up on the ground

  The pupae develop inside a silken cocoon over 10 to 15 days in soil at a depth of  or in cotton bolls or maize ears

  The cotton bollworm is a highly polyphagous species The most important crop hosts are tomato cotton pigeon pea chickpea rice sorghum and cowpea Other hosts include groundnut okra peas field beans soybeans lucerne Phaseolus spp other Leguminosae tobacco potatoes maize flax Dianthus Rosa Pelargonium Chrysanthemum Lavandula angustifolia a number of fruit trees forest trees and a range of vegetable crops In Russia and adjacent countries the larvae populate more than 120 plant species favouring Solanum Datura Hyoscyamus Atriplex and Amaranthus genera

  The greatest damage is caused to cotton tomatoes maize chick peas alfalfa and tobacco The economic threshold of harmfulness in central Asia is three to five larvae per hundred plants of longstaple cotton and eight to 12 larvae per hundred plants on mediumstaple cotton In cotton crops blooms that have been attacked may open prematurely and stay fruitless When the bolls are damaged some will fall off and others will fail to produce lint or produce lint of an inferior quality Secondary infections by fungi and bacteria are common and may lead to rotting of fruits Injury to the growing tips of plants may disturb their development maturity may be delayed and the fruits may be dropped Control measures include the use of NOCTOVI adulticide attract and kill formulation growing of resistant varieties weeding interrow cultivation removing crop residues deep autumn ploughing winter watering to destroy the pupae the use of insecticides or biological control through the release of entomophages such as Trichogramma spp and Habrobracon hebetor Monitoring is possible by the use of sex pheromone traps Development of Bt cotton genetically modified to produce Bacillus thuringiensis toxin improved yields of lint

  The Grace song
  The Grace is a song written by Canadian recording artist and producer Daniel Victor in August 2005 and appears on the Neverending White Lights debut album

  The song was written with the intent of using Canadian singerperformer Dallas Green of Alexisonfire as the featured vocalist In a lastminute attempt to lift the sound of the album Victor came up with The Grace during a late night writing session only a month before the album went into stores After capturing Dallas Greens vocal parts in Toronto Ontario the song was promptly mixed and released in Canada

  Every instrument and part in the song was performed and recorded by Daniel Victor in his home studio in Windsor Ontario Canada except for the violin parts Commenting on the songs name Victor stated that its about someones thoughts that dying could be a positive thing a good transition to get away from the worldand the person in the song is trying to figure out where he really belongs in this world with the help of his angelsquoted from an email reply written to a fan Themes of life and death are the main focus of Victors debut album and this song is no exception Its original title was The Grace of a Happy Death

  As the first single from the album it received extensive radio play across the country eventually charting 3 on Rock Radio and 1 the Rock Audience Chart It also reached 1 on many popular radio station countdowns including Edge 102 in Toronto for 2 weeks

  The music video is a cinematic bluetinged love story between a man played by Victor and a fallen angel played by musician Emm Gryner in the Victorian era It hit 1 on MuchMusic in April 2006 and on MuchMoreMusic for two weeks that same month The Grace essentially launched Neverending White Lights into the Canadian spotlight

  The video starts off with glimpses of statues of angels and a camera clicking as they are filmed It then leads to a scene of Victor mending the wings of a fallen angel in his home As he sews the feathers in a long and painful process tears roll down the angels cheeks Victor wipes them off gently with a feather Over the next few days as he finishes his work plays music to her and shows her the film of the statues hed taken earlier it is evident he falls in love with her Each day the angel puts on a white pendant with the figure of a woman on it and Victor shows her a good time But at last Victors work is done and the grateful angel with her new wings touches his face gingerly before disappearing She leaves the pendant behind Heartbroken Victor commits suicide and the angel reappears then and stays by his side grieving as the song ends with one final piano note

  Sabbath School
  Sabbath School is a function of the Seventhday Adventist ChurchSeventh Day Baptist Church of God SeventhDay some other sabbatarian denominations usually comprising a song service and Bible study lesson on the Sabbath It is usually held before the church service on Saturday morning but this may vary

  It includes programs that are Bible based to foster Christian growth This period usually lasts for a period of 1 hour 40 minutes During this time the lesson study is also conducted

  Sabbath School usually begins at 930am or 1030am on Saturday mornings before the worship service starts The Sabbath School service for adults typically has two portions The first portion begins with a song service followed by a mission emphasis and a short talk The second and larger portion is the lesson study Different churches conduct Sabbath School in many ways mostly teaching on the same topic or reading in a given week as each quarter of the year has a different theme that reflects Bible doctrinal or church lifestyle teachings The lesson booklet is called the quarterly

  Sabbath School may be conducted in one large class or the congregation may separate into smaller groups for discussion in the sanctuary or in different rooms Participation is not restricted to Church members Young people often meet separately After Sabbath School the church service begins usually at 1100am

  On the last Sabbath of the quarter or the 13th Sabbath a special collection is taken for a missionary project During the 13th Sabbath Program youngsters may present a music or acting special based on the subject learned that quarter or explain the traditions and dress in the attire of the countries or world regions which offerings collected will benefit Communion Service preceded by footwashing may take place on or right after the 13th Sabbath

  A 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders estimated that 67 of Adventists including 63 of under18s attend Sabbath School nearly every week

  Sabbath School teachers are usually lay people selected by a designated coordinator board or committee Normally the selection is based on a perception of character and ability to teach the Bible rather than formal training in education although some Sabbath School teachers have a background in education as a result of their occupation Some churches offer courses in teaching or hold teachers classes to go over the lesson for that Sabbath other churches allow volunteers who make a profession of faith to teach without training

  Adult church members are provided with the Adult Bible Study Guide formerly known as Sabbath School Quarterly issued four times a year It is also known as the Quarterly and the Lesson It is published by Pacific Press Publishing Association Sabbath School quarterlies are Bible study guides that cover a specific topic or book of the Bible every quarter The quarterly is designed to be read during the week so that during Sabbath School the class members are ready to discuss questions and topics raised in that lesson in small groups The Adult Sabbath School always has a heavy focus on the Bible All Seventhday Adventists around the world use the same Sabbath School quarterly translated into the necessary languages with few exceptions such as Germany where members cover the same topic with different material the editor of the Adult Sabbath School lessons was Clifford Goldstein

  At the same time as the adult study children attend classes for their age group Typical age group divisions are Beginner infants Kindergarten K Primary Grades 13 Junior Grades 46 Earliteen Grades 78 Youth High School and Collegiate College and Young Adult Each age division has its own specific quarterly which is titled by the class name up to Primary Juniors and Earliteens often share the same quarterly entitled PowerPoints Some Earliteen groups use a separate publication entitled Real Time Faith Youth use either Cornerstone Connections or Collegiate Quarterly CQ Some churches give the children a weekly magazine at the close of Sabbath School Kindergarten receives Our Little Friend Primary receives Primary Treasure Juniors and Earliteens receive Guide and the Youth receive Insight

 <doc id="7702556" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702556" title="FMX broadcasting">
  FMX broadcasting
  FMX is the name of a commercially unsuccessful noise reduction system developed in the 1980s for FM broadcasting in the United States

  FM stereo broadcasting is known to incur up to a 23 dB noise penalty over that of monophonic FM broadcasting this is due to the combination of the triangular FM noise spectrum and the wider baseband bandwidth occupied by the stereo multiplex signal Developed at the CBS Technology Center FMX was intended to improve this characteristic for listeners in the fringe areas where the noise penalty would be worst This improvement was achieved by adding an amplitudecompressed version of the LR leftminusright or difference signal modulated in quadrature with the stereo subcarrier using a version of the CX noisereduction system originally developed at CBS for LP records

  Upon his accession as Chairman of CBS Laurence Tisch closed the CBS labs in 1986 whereupon the FMX intellectual property was spun off to an investment group under the name Broadcast Technology Partners BTP

  With about 50 stations using the technology and perhaps another 50 committed a controversy emerged in 1989 when MIT professor and Bose Corporation CEO Amar Bose and Bose engineer William Short released a critical study finding the system to have the potential to seriously degrade the quality of stereo reception whether received by FMX equipment or not According to the study the heavy compression of the LR audio caused interference in receivers under multipath conditions A BTP spokesman rebutted the finding saying that the Bose analysis exaggerated a worstcase scenario and actually employed flawed mathematics to attempt to prove their point Perhaps not coincidentally a patent application filed earlier by Bose disclosed an invention whose implementation was incompatible with the adoption of FMX while another  filed by Bose and Short around the time of the release of the critical study  sought to improve the performance of FMX under multipath conditions

  Despite industrial supporters in both the broadcast and consumer electronics industries the system never achieved a critical mass and faded into obscurity However numerous related patents have since been applied for or granted referencing the original FMX patents

 <doc id="7702566" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702566" title="Supercritical fluid chromatography">
  Supercritical fluid chromatography
  Supercritical fluid chromatography SFC is a form of normal phase chromatography that uses a supercritical fluid such as carbon dioxide as the mobile phase It is used for the analysis and purification of low to moderate molecular weight thermally labile molecules and can also be used for the separation of chiral compounds Principles are similar to those of high performance liquid chromatography HPLC however SFC typically utilizes carbon dioxide as the mobile phase therefore the entire chromatographic flow path must be pressurized Because the supercritical phase represents a state in which liquid and gas properties converge supercritical fluid chromatography is sometimes called convergence chromatography

  SFC is used in industry primarily for separation of chiral molecules and uses the same columns as standard HPLC systems SFC is now commonly used for achiral separations and purifications in the pharmaceutical industry

  SFC with CO utilizes carbon dioxide pumps that require that the incoming CO and pump heads be kept cold in order to maintain the carbon dioxide at a temperature and pressure that keeps it in a liquid state where it can be effectively metered at some specified flow rate The CO subsequently becomes supercritical post the injector and in the column oven when the temperature and pressure it is subjected to are raised above the critical point of the liquid and the supercritical state is achieved SFC as a chromatographic process has been likened to a process having the combined properties of the power of a liquid to dissolve a matrix with the chromatographic interactions and kinetics of a gas The result is that you can get a lot of mass on column per injection and still maintain a high chromatographic efficiency Typically gradient elution is employed in analytical SFC using a polar cosolvent such as methanol possibly with a weak acid or base at low concentrations 1 The effective plate counts per analysis can be observed to exceed 500K plates per metre routinely with 5um material The operator uses software to set mobile phase flow rate cosolvent composition system back pressure and column oven temperature which must exceed 40C for supercritical conditions to be achieved with CO In addition SFC provides an additional control parameter  pressure  by using an automated back pressure regulator From an operational standpoint SFC is as simple and robust as HPLC but fraction collection is more convenient because the primary mobile phase evaporates leaving only the analyte and a small volume of polar cosolvent If the outlet CO is captured it can be recompressed and recycled allowing for 90 reuse of CO

  Similar to HPLC SFC uses a variety of detection methods including UVVIS mass spectrometry FID unlike HPLC and evaporative light scattering

  A ruleofthumb is that any molecule that will dissolve in methanol or a less polar solvent is compatible with SFC including polar solutes CO has polarity similar to nheptane at its critical point but the solvent strength can be increased by increasing density or using a polar cosolvent In practice when the fraction of cosolvent is high the mobile phase is not truly supercritical but this terminology is used regardless

  The mobile phase is composed primarily of supercritical carbon dioxide but since CO on its own is too nonpolar to effectively elute many analytes cosolvents are added to modify the mobile phase polarity Cosolvents are typically simple alcohols like methanol ethanol or isopropyl alcohol Other solvents such as acetonitrile chloroform or ethyl acetate can be used as modifiers For foodgrade materials the selected cosolvent is often ethanol or ethyl acetate both of which are generally recognized as safe GRAS The solvent limitations are system and column based

  There have been a few technical issues that have limited adoption of SFC technology first of which is the high pressure operating conditions Highpressure vessels are expensive and bulky and special materials are often needed to avoid dissolving gaskets and Orings in the supercritical fluid A second drawback is difficulty in maintaining pressure backpressure regulation Whereas liquids are nearly incompressible so their densities are constant regardless of pressure supercritical fluids are highly compressible and their physical properties change with pressure  such as the pressure drop across a packedbed column Currently automated backpressure regulators can maintain a constant pressure in the column even if flow rate varies mitigating this problem A third drawback is difficulty in gasliquid separation during collection of product Upon depressurization the CO rapidly turns into gas and aerosolizes any dissolved analyte in the process Cyclone separators have lessened difficulties in gasliquid separations

  Emerin
  Emerin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the EMD gene also known as the STA gene Emerin together with LEMD3 is a LEM domaincontaining integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane in vertebrates Emerin is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle In cardiac muscle emerin localizes to adherens junctions within intercalated discs where it appears to function in mechanotransduction of cellular strain and in betacatenin signaling Mutations in emerin cause Xlinked recessive EmeryDreifuss muscular dystrophy cardiac conduction abnormalities and dilated cardiomyopathy

  It is named after Alan Emery

  Emerin is a 290 kDa 34 kDa observed MW protein composed of 254 amino acids Emerin is a serinerich protein with an Nterminal 20amino acid hydrophobic region that is flanked by charged residues the hydrophobic region may be important for anchoring the protein to the membrane with the charged terminal tails being cytosolic In cardiac skeletal and smooth muscle emerin localizes to the inner nuclear membrane expression of emerin is highest in skeletal and cardiac muscle In cardiac muscle specifically emerin also resides at adherens junctions within intercalated discs

  Emerin is a serinerich nuclear membrane protein and a member of the nuclear laminaassociated protein family It mediates membrane anchorage to the cytoskeleton EmeryDreifuss muscular dystrophy is an Xlinked inherited degenerative myopathy resulting from mutation in the EMD also known clinically as STA gene Emerin appears to be involved in mechanotransduction as emerindeficient mouse fibroblasts failed to transduce normal mechanosensitive gene expression responses to strain stimuli In cardiac muscle emerin is also found complexed to betacatenin at adherens junctions of intercalated discs and cardiomyocytes from hearts lacking emerin showed betacatenin redistribution as well as perturbed intercalated disc architecture and myocyte shape This interaction appears to be regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta

  Mutations in emerin cause Xlinked recessive EmeryDreifuss muscular dystrophy which is characterized by early contractures in the Achilles tendons elbows and postcervical muscles muscle weakness proximal in the upper limbs and distal in lower limbs along with cardiac conduction defects that range from sinus bradycardia PR prolongation to complete heart block In these patients immunostaining of emerin is lost in various tissues including muscle skin fibroblasts and leukocytes however diagnostic protocols involve mutational analysis rather than protein staining In nearly all cases mutations result in a complete deletion or undetectable levels of emerin protein Approximately 20 of cases have X chromosomes with an inversion within the Xq28 region

  Moreover recent research have found that the absence of functional emerin may decrease the infectivity of HIV1 Thus it is speculated that patients suffering from EmeryDreifuss muscular dystrophy may have immunity to or show an irregular infection pattern to HIV1

 <doc id="7702640" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702640" title="Cephalophore">
  Cephalophore
  A cephalophore from the Greek for headcarrier is a saint who is generally depicted carrying their own head In Christian art this was usually meant to signify that the subject in question had been martyred by beheading Handling the halo in this circumstance offers a unique challenge for the artist some put the halo where the head used to be others have the saint carrying the halo along with the head and some split the difference
  Associated legends often tell of the saint standing and carrying his own head after the beheading

  The term cephalophore was first used in a French article by Marcel Hbert Les martyrs cphalophores Euchaire Elophe et Libaire in Revue de lUniversit de Bruxelles v 19 1914

  The topos can be traced to two sources In a homily on Saints Juventinus and Maximinus John Chrysostom asserted that the severed head of a martyr was more terrifying to the devil than when it was able to speak He then compared soldiers showing their wounds received in battle to martyrs holding their severed head in their hands and presenting it to Christ The other source was the Western vita of Saint Denis founder of the see of Paris who was identified in the text with Dionysius the Areopagite
  John the Baptist the best known beheaded saint is not considered a cephalophore since he did not hold his own head in his hands
  Thus an original and perhaps the most famous cephalophore is Denis patron saint of Paris who according to the Golden Legend miraculously preached with his head in his hands while journeying the seven miles from Montmartre to his burying place Although St Denis is the best known of the saintly headcarriers there were many others the folklorist mile Nourry counted no less than 134 examples of cephalophory in French hagiographic literature alone Given the frequency with which relics were stolen in medieval Europe stories like this in which a saint clearly indicates their chosen burial site may have developed as a way of discouraging such acts of furta sacra

  A cephalophoric legend of Nicasius of Rheims tells that at the moment of his execution Nicasius was reading Psalm 119 Psalm 118 in the Vulgate When he reached the verse Adhaesit pavimento anima mea My soul is attached unto dust verse 25 he was decapitated After his head had fallen to the ground Nicasius continued the psalm adding Vivifica me Domine secundum verbum tuum Revive me Lord with your words The theme of the speaking head is extended in the 8thcentury Passio of Saint Justus of Beauvais after the child had been beheaded by Roman soldiers his father and brother found the corpse sitting with his head in his lap Giving the head to his father Justus asked him to carry it to Auxerre that his mother Felicia might kiss it

  The legend of Aphrodisius of Alexandria was transferred to Bziers where his name was inserted at the head of the list of bishops In the hagiographic accounts Aphrodisius was accompanied by his camel As he was preaching a group of pagans pressed through the crowd and beheaded him on the spot Aphrodisius picked up his head and carried it to the chapel which he had recently consecrated at the site It is identified today as Place SaintAphrodise Bziers
  Saint Gemolo is said to have survived his decapitation and after collecting his head climbed on horseback He rode to meet his uncle a bishop on a small mountain before he finally died
  A legend associated with Saint Gins de la Jara states that after he was decapitated in southern France he picked up his head and threw it into the Rhne The head was carried by the sea to the coast of Cartagena in Spain where it was venerated as a relic Cartagena was the center of this saints cult

  In The Golden Legend Paul the Apostle at his martyrdom stretched forth his neck and so was beheaded And as soon as the head was from the body it said Jesus Christus which had been to Jesus or Christus or both fifty times When the head was recovered and was to be rejoined to the body as a relic in response to a prayer for confirmation that this was indeed the right head the body of Paul turned to rejoin the head that had been set at its feet

  In legend the female saint Osyth stood up after her execution picking up her head like Saint Denis in Paris and other cephalophoric martyrs and walking with it in her hands to the door of a local convent before collapsing there Similarly Valerie of Limoges carried her severed head away to her confessor Saint Martial

  Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne is often depicted with his head on his neckshoulders and carrying a second head in his hands However he is not a cephalophore The second head is that of Saint Oswald of Northumbria who was buried with him at Durham Cathedral

  In Dantes Divine Comedy Canto 28 the poet meets the spectre of the troubadour Bertrand de Born in the eighth circle of the Inferno carrying his severed head in his hand slung by its hair like a lantern upon seeing Dante and Virgil the head begins to speak

  The speaking severed head appears memorably in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight

  The motif Head in Stith Thompsons MotifIndex of Folk Literature reveals how universal is the anomaly of the talking severed head Aristotle is at pains to discredit the stories of talking heads and to establish the physical impossibility with the windpipe severed from the lung Moreover he adds among the barbarians where heads are chopped off with great rapidity nothing of the kind has ever occurred Aristotle was doubtless familiar with the story of the singing disembodied head of Orpheus and Homers image of heads severed so rapidly they seemed still to be speaking and Latin examples could be attested A link between Latin poets and the Middle Ages in transmitting the trope of the speaking head was noted by Beatrice White in the Latin poem on the Trojan War De Bello Troiano by Joseph of Exeter Hector whirls in the air the severed head of Patroclus which whispers Ultor ubi Aeacides Where is Achilles Aeacides my avenger
  Some modern authors link the legends of cephalophores miraculously walking with their heads in their hands to the Celtic cult of heads

  Kenmare Resources
  Kenmare Resources plc is a mining company based in the Republic of Ireland It is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange
  Kenmare owns and operates the Moma mine Moma is the worlds largest titanium mineral deposit located 160km from the city of Nampula in Mozambique Africa

  The company was founded by Charles and Michael Carvill in 1986 to exploit mineral wealth in Mozambique

  The Company acquired the licence for the Congolone heavy mineral sands deposit in 1987 In 1994 the Company began production of graphite at the licence In 1996 BHP became licence partner Over the coming years BHP would begin appraising the Namalope Pillivi and Mualadi deposits which would ultimately become the main focus of the mining project BHP pulled out of the mine in 1999 and by 2001 Kenmare had acquired the exclusive rights to the deposit
  Work began constructing the mine in 2003 Production began in 2007 and commercial production commenced in 2009

  A tailings dam from mineral processing failed on 8 October 2010 destroying a nearby native village and leaving one 4 year old child missing mining resumed the following month after some 300 homes had been rebuilt

  The Companys principal asset is the Moma mineral sands mine formally known as the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine located in Moma Nampula Province Mozambique It has been in production since late 2007 The mine produces 7 of the worlds ilmenite the main source of titanium metal and titanium dioxide used as a white pigment in paint It also produces 4 of the worlds zircon a source of zirconium metal

  The Moma mine also produces zircon the primary application for zircon is in the manufacture of opacifiers for ceramics

  The mine is estimated to have a mine life of up to 150 years The total proved and probable ore reserves under the Namalope Pilivili and Nataka mining concession are estimated as at 31 December 2017 at 1742 million tonnes grading 28 ilmenite 019 zircon and 0061 rutile containing 48 million tonnes of ilmenite 32 million tonnes of zircon and 106 million tonnes of rutile The total ore resource excluding reserves held by the Group under a combination of exploration licences and mining concessions is estimated as at 31 December 2017 at 63 billion tonnes grading 24 ilmenite 016 zircon and 0052 rutile containing 149 million tonnes of ilmenite 10 million tonnes of zircon and 33 million tonnes of rutile

  Products  Markets
  The Moma mine produces three main products Ilmenite Zircon and Rutile It is also currently developing plans to produce Monazite

  Ilmenite is a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks sediments and sedimentary rocks in many parts of the world Apollo astronauts found abundant ilmenite in lunar rocks and the lunar regolith Ilmenite is a black irontitanium oxide with a chemical composition of FeTiO3
  Ilmenite is the primary ore of titanium a metal needed to make a variety of highperformance alloys Most of the ilmenite mined worldwide is used to manufacture titanium dioxide TiO2 an important pigment whiting and polishing abrasive
  Ilmenite is the main source of titanium dioxide which is used in paints fabrics plastics paper sunscreen food and cosmetics
  Kenmare produces 7 of the worlds ilmenite

  Zircon is a zirconium silicate mineral with a chemical composition of ZrSiO4 It is common throughout the world as a minor constituent of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks
  Zircon is present in most soils and clastic sediments Zirconrich sediments are mined and the recovered zircon is used to produce zirconium metal and zirconium dioxide These are used in a wide variety of manufactured products and industrial processes
  Zircon is mainly consumed as an opacifier and has been known to be used in the decorative ceramics industry

  Rutile is a titanium oxide mineral that is most commonly found in granites pegmatites and metamorphic rocks It is also found in sands derived from the weathering of these rocks Rutile also forms as slender crystals within quartz and micas It is a common mineral in the alluvial sands that are dredged for magnetite and ilmenite
  Rutile is used as a coating on welding rods It is also used as an ore of titanium a metal used where light weight and high strength are needed Some rutile is used in the production of pigments for paints

  Monazite is a rare phosphate mineral with a chemical composition of CeLaNdThPO4SiO4 It usually occurs in small isolated grains as an accessory mineral in igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite pegmatite schist and gneiss These grains are resistant to weathering and become concentrated in soils and sediments downslope from the host rock When in high enough concentrations they are mined for their rare earth and thorium content
  Monazite is an important source of thorium cerium and other rare elements Often mined as a byproduct from heavy mineral deposits
  Kenmare does not yet produce Monazite however the company announced its intention to begin production in the future

  Kenmares products are raw materials for the production of many consumer products The market for ilmenite zircon and rutile is a substantial one and is heavily linked to the performance of the global economy Kenmares sales profile is geographically diverse with 18 sold into the United States 25 into Europe and 57 into Asia principally China

  Against the backdrop of a bottleneck in global supply and a very favourable market the decision was taken in 2011 to undertake a major expansion of the mine The goal of the expansion was to raise production to 1m tonnes
  As the project was being developed the market cycle turned By 2016 the mine had fallen into financial crisis due to a worldwide drop in mineral prices flooding in northern Mozambique and power outages in the Moma District region6 Prices for titanium fell by about a third between 2012 and 20157 and floods that caused power outages impacted the companys production8

  The mine briefly suspended operations in June 2015 in the face of industrial action by employees unhappy about the companys costcutting measures Successful negotiation between the union the company and the Ministry of Labour had resulted in agreement on somewhat less drastic measures involving fewer layoffs than originally announced The industrial action was not organized by the union Operations resumed in early July

  In June 2014 following media speculation in Australia both Iluka and Kenmare Resources announced that the former Company had many an approach to Kenmare based on a paper transaction regarding a possible takeover No formal offer was made although a number of prices were put forward
  The process carried on over an extended period during which Iluka returned with a lower offer  The Iluka approaches failed to attract support from Kenmares largest shareholder and Iluka ultimately ended the process in December 2015

  As Iluka were announcing their decision to withdraw from takeover talks Kenmare management announced that the Oman Sovereign Wealth Fund had indicated an interest in investing 100m based on an overall restructuring arrangement being accepted by shareholders The deal which would ultimately be agreed saw the Omanis invest 100m of an overall 275 refinancing of the company Lenders to the Company agreed to substantially reduce debt Existing shareholders also experienced a write down as new shares were issued The overall impact of the restructuring was to leave the company with a substantially strengthened Balance Sheet placing the Company on a firm financial footing

  Since the completion of the Mine expansion production and shipments have risen to record levels Production in 2017 was just short of 1m tonnes Kenmare reported a return to profit in 2017 Full year profits after tax of 194m were reported by the Company On October 16th 2018 Kenmare announced their first dividend policy They indicated dividend payments would commence in 2019

  In their interim results in August 2018 Kenmare announced a number of projects which had either been approved or were under active consideration The goal of these projects is to increase long term production to 12m tonnes of ilmenite and associated products These include the upgrade of an existing Wet Concentrator Plant development of a new Wet Concentrator Plant and a project to recover Monazite from existing operations

  Grey peacockpheasant
  The grey peacockpheasant Polyplectron bicalcaratum also known as Burmese peacockpheasant is a large Asian member of the order Galliformes It is the national bird of Myanmar

  It is a large pheasant up to 76cm long and greyish brown with finely spotted green eyespots an elongated bushy crest bare pink or yellow facial skin white throat and grey iris bill and legs The sexes are rather similar but the female is smaller darker and less ornamented than the male The young resemble the female

  The grey peacockpheasant is distributed in lowland and hill forests of Bangladesh Northeast India and Southeast Asia but excluding most of Indochina as well as the entire Malayan Peninsula The diet consists mainly of seeds termites fruits and invertebrates The female usually lays two eggs

  Widespread throughout its large range the grey peacockpheasant is evaluated as a Species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species It is listed on CITES Appendix II restricting trade in wildcaught birds to preserve its stocks

  Three subspecies are recognized today as good while an additional one is of unclear validity

  One previous subspecies the Hainan peacockpheasant P b katsumatae has since been given approved species AS status by the IOC

  Lowes grey peacockpheasant was described from a captive bird of unknown provenance Similar examples have turned up on occasion but the validity and  if distinct  home range of this taxon remains unknown It was theorized to inhabit western Assam or the eastern Himalayas but this is based on conjecture

  The phylogeny of this species is fairly enigmatic mtDNA cytochrome b and Dloop as well as the nuclear ovomucoid intron G sequence data confirms that it belongs to a largely Continental Asian clade together with Germains peacockpheasant P germaini but also the brown southern species bronzetailed peacockpheasant P chalcurum and mountain peacockpheasant P inopinatum

  The ovomucin sequence seems to have evolved convergently or with a decreased mutational rate on the grey and the bronzetailed peacockpheasant Though they are quite similar on the molecular level the distance and interspersed populations of their closest relatives argue against a much more recently shared common ancestry between them versus the other two northern peacockpheasants Also the cytochrome b and Dloop data does not support a closer relationship between P bicalcaratus and P chalcurum overall as it seems the four species ancestors separated during a very short timespan

  Note however that in the absence of dedicated phylogeographic studies the molecular data is only of limited value in this species the most morphologically diverse and widespread peacockpheasant There is no data on the origin and number of specimens but it is unlikely that more than one or two individuals  possibly of captive origin and undeterminable subspecific allocation  were sampled All that can be reasonably assumed is that the grey peacockpheasant evolved on mainland Southeast Asia probably during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene 361 million years ago

  Overseas Tankship UK Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd
  Overseas Tankship UK Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd commonly known as Wagon Mound No 1 is a landmark tort law case which imposed a remoteness rule for causation in negligence The Privy Council held that a party can be held liable only for loss that was reasonably foreseeable Contributory negligence on the part of the dock owners was also relevant in the decision and was essential to the outcome although not central to this cases legal significance

  The Wagon Mound No 1 should not be confused with the successor case of the Overseas Tankship v Miller Steamship or Wagon Mound No 2 which concerned the standard of the reasonable man in breach of the duty of care

  Overseas Tankship had a ship the Wagon Mound docked in Sydney Harbour in October 1951 The crew had carelessly allowed furnace oil also referred to as Bunker oil to leak from their ship The oil drifted under a wharf thickly coating the water and the shore where other ships were being repaired Hot metal produced by welders using oxyacetylene torches on the respondents timber wharf Morts Dock at Sheerlegs Wharf fell on floating cotton waste which ignited the oil on the water The wharf and ships moored there sustained substantial fire damage In an action by Morts Dock for damages for negligence it was found as a fact that the defendants did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the oil was capable of being set alight when spread on water The dock owners knew the oil was there and continued to use welders

  The leading case on proximate cause was Re Polemis which held that a defendant can be deemed liable for all consequences flowing from his negligent conduct regardless of how unforeseeable such consequences are As this case was binding in Australia its rule was followed by the New South Wales Court of Appeal The defendant appealed to the Privy Council

  The Privy Council found in favour of the defendant agreeing with the expert witness who provided evidence that the defendant in spite of the furnace oil being innately flammable could not reasonably expect it to burn on water The Board indicated Morts would probably have been successful if they had claimed damages for direct damage by the oil to the slipway but this was minor and not part of the damages claimed although success on this count may have saved Morts Dock and Engineering the costs of all the litigation for both parties across all three levels of court Viscount Simonds in his delivery for the Privy Council said that the Counsel for Morts had discredited their own position by arguing that it couldnt have been bunkering oil because it wouldnt burn on water The Privy Councils advice soundly disapproved the rule established in Re Polemis as being out of the current of contemporary thought and held that to find a party liable for negligence the damage must be reasonably foreseeable The council found that even though the crew were careless and breached their duty of care the resulting extensive damage by fire was not foreseeable by a reasonable person although the minor damage of oil on metal on the slipway would have been foreseeable

  Viscount Simonds delivered the judgment of the Board and said

  It is no doubt proper when considering tortious liability for negligence to analyse its elements and to say that the plaintiff must prove a duty owed to him by the defendant a breach of that duty by the defendant and consequent damage But there can be no liability until the damage has been done It is not the act but the consequences on which tortious liability is founded  Who knows or can be assumed to know all the processes of nature But if it would be wrong that a man should be held liable for damage unpredictable by a reasonable man because it was direct or natural equally it would be wrong that he should escape liability however indirect the damage if he foresaw or could reasonably foresee the intervening events which led to its being done

  It is a principle of civil liability subject only to qualifications which have no present relevance that a man must be considered to be responsible for the probable consequences of his act To demand more of him is too harsh a rule to demand less is to ignore that civilised order requires the observance of a minimum standard of behaviour

  Up until this time the leading case had been Re Polemis where the central question was that of the directness of the chain of events between the triggering act being examined for negligence and the result The Council decided that rather than go with precedent authority they would determine a principle from a range of cases in a similar way as Lord Atkin did in Donoghue v Stevenson and their principle was primarily a single test for foreseeability which they argued was a logical link between the damage and the liability culpability Stated differently foreseeability was the logical link between and the test for breach of the duty of care and the damages This is the supreme test and may be rephrased as the liability of a consequence  was natural or necessary or probable The Lords made reference to hindsight indicating it is nothing like foresight and should play no role in assessing negligence There is authority to challenge this view of hindsight in Page v Smith Lord Lloyd stated In the case of secondary victims ie persons who were not participants in an accident the defendant will not be liable unless psychiatric injury is foreseeable in a person of normal fortitude and it may be legitimate to use hindsight in order to be able to apply the test of reasonable foreseeability

  The Lords gave Morts the opportunity to sue in nuisance but there is no record of them testing this action in that tort The common law rules of causation have had their importance lessened by the promulgation of statute law in Australia Contributory negligence is now essential for many determinations and are covered by statutes such as the Civil Liability Act 1936 South Australia which has more recent counterparts in a number of jurisdictions including New South Wales

  Community College of the Air Force
  The Community College of the Air Force CCAF is a federal program offered by the United States Air Force which grants twoyear Associate of Applied Science AAS degrees in association with Air University CCAF serves approximately 300000 active guard and reserve enlisted personnel making CCAF the worlds largest community college system The college awards over 22000 associate in applied science degrees from 71 degree programs annually

  The CCAF is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools through Air University

  In the early 1970s the Air Force decided to attempt to gain accreditation and recognition for Air Force training programs Representatives of the Air Training Command ATC Air University and the United States Air Force Academy held numerous conferences in 1971 to discuss increased training for Air Force noncommissioned officers NCOs These conferences in turn recommended the foundation of an Air Force community college On 9 November 1971 Gen John D Ryan Air Force Chief of Staff approved the establishment of the Community College of the Air Force The Secretary of the Air Force approved the plan 25 January 1972 and the college was officially established on 1 April 1972 at Randolph AFB TX

  Until the mid1970s the CCAF offered only certificate programs It became apparent that CCAF standards exceeded the minimum requirements of associate degree programs in civilian community colleges Therefore in 1975 the Air Force sought degreegranting authority for the college from Congress President Gerald R Ford signed Public Law 94361 on 14 July 1976 authorizing the AETC commander to confer the associate degree

  Following an evaluation in October 1976 the US Commissioner of Education certified degreegranting authority in January 1977 The college awarded its first AAS degree in April 1977

  When the Commission on Occupational Education Institution charter was limited in 1975 to nondegreegranting institutions the CCAF began seeking accreditation from the SACS Commission on Colleges The Commission on Colleges accredited the CCAF on 12 December 1980 In 2004 Air University became accredited by the SACS Commission on Colleges to award associate and masters degrees CCAF now shares in Air Universitys regional accreditation CCAF was separately accredited by SACS from 1980 to 2004

  Currently the CCAF is only open to airmen but Congressman Sestak added language to the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act to open admission to all branches

  The program combines the technical education offered by Air Force schools with a core of general education from regionally accredited civilian institutions and management education from Air Force or civilian sources

  The CCAF offers Associates of Applied Science degrees in five broad career areas


  Within those 5 broad areas the CCAF currently offers 67 specific degree programs

  In June 2007 Air University announced a new program where fouryear colleges accept the entire value 60 credits of the CCAF Associate degree towards a bachelors degree requiring only 60 more credits typically upper division core classes This program is called the Air University AssociateToBaccalaureate Cooperative It has been publicized as a convenient way for an Airman to complete their 4year degree It has also served to boost the desirability of a CCAF degree as there is a notion among the enlisted members that a CCAF Associate degree only holds value in the Air Force community As of October 2009 the AUABC program included 42 civilian colleges and universities offering 209 bachelors degree programs Thirtysix of the ABC schools hold regional accreditation and six hold national accreditation through the Distance Education Accrediting Commission formerly the Distance Education and Training Council For additional information on accreditation please refer to the Council for Higher Education Accreditation CHEA or US Department of Education websites

  HansEkkehard Bob
  Hans Ekkehard Bob 24 January 1917  12 August 2013 was a German fighter pilot serving with the Luftwaffe During World War II Bob flew approximately 700 combat missions and claimed 60 victories 37 of which were on the Eastern Front

  Bob joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 at the rank of a Fahnenjunker officer candidate and began his flight training on 1 June 1937

  In 1939 prior to the Invasion of Poland Bob was transferred to the newly formed 3Jagdgeschwader 21 JG 21 later known as the Devils Squadron which was redesignated on 6 June 1940 into 9Jagdgeschwader 54 JG 54 It was equipped with the Bf 109 fighter an aircraft Bob would become very familiar with over the years  flying every model except the Kurfrst

  During the French campaign on 10 May 1940 Bob claimed his first victory when he shot down a Gloster Gladiator over Tongeren in Belgium That August he was promoted to the rank of Oberleutnant On 10 October 1940 he was appointed Staffelkapitn of 7JG 54 for a short period he was soon appointed Staffelkapitn of 9JG 54

  During the Battle of Britain 9JG 54 was activated as a Jabo unit targeting shipping vessels By November 1940 Bob had recorded 19 kills and was awarded the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes by Reichsmarschall Hermann Gring on 7 March 1941

  On 21 March 1941 Bob survived unhurt a ditching into Cherbourg harbour with his B 131 training aircraft which had suffered engine failure After the Battle of Britain he participated in the Balkan campaign where he recorded his 20th and 21st victories JG 54 was reequipped with the new Bf 109 F and relocated to airfields in Prussia in preparation for Operation Barbarossa the invasion of Russia

  On 23 June 1941 Hans Ekkehard Bob recorded his first victory in Russian airspace  a Tupolev SB twinengined bomber During this combat his Bf 109 F2 was hit by return fire resulting in a forced landing behind enemy lines He evaded capture and returned to his unit two days later Between 13 July and 30 October 1941 Bob made three more emergency landings due to aircraft combat damage behind enemy lines but in each case returned to his unit

  On 29 September 1942 Bob had his 50th victory and was promoted to Hauptmann later that year Flying on the Eastern Front ended for Hans Ekkehard Bob and IIIJG 54 in February 1943 after he received orders from General der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland to change positions with elements of the then Frenchbased JG 26 This order was later cancelled but III Gruppe stayed on the Western Front separated from the rest of the Greenhearts serving initially in northern Germany with Jagdgeschwader 1

  On 17 April 1943 Bob recorded his 57th victory the ramming of a USAAF Boeing B17 bomber near Bremen with his Bf 109 G6 He bailed out and survived the crash without injury On 1 August Bob was promoted to the rank of Major and was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of IVJG 54 He returned to the Eastern Front where he scored a further two victories

  By May 1944 Bob was back at the Western Front as Gruppenkommandeur of IIJagdgeschwader 3 JG 3 based in the Normandy invasion front corridor flying Reichsverteidigung Defense of the Reich duties In August he was transferred to Erprobungskommando 262 where he learned to fly the Messerschmitt Me 262

  In early 1945 his experience led to his becoming a member of General der Flieger Josef Kammhubers staff Bob was responsible for allocating newly built Me 262s to operational units Later he took command of I and IIEJG 2 and was responsible for practice and training former bomber pilots in flying the Me 262
